 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C2V1">&nbsp;</a>Wherefore laying aside all malice, and all guile, and hypocrisies, and envies, and all evil speakings,
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C2V2">&nbsp;</a>As newborn babes, desire the sincere milk of the word, that ye may grow thereby:
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C2V3">&nbsp;</a>If so be ye have tasted that the Lord
<span class="add">is</span> gracious.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C2V4">&nbsp;</a>To whom coming,
<span class="add">as unto</span> a living stone, disallowed indeed of men, but chosen of God,
<span class="add">and</span> precious,
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C2V5">&nbsp;</a>Ye also, as lively stones, are built up a spiritual house, an holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual
sacrifices, acceptable to God by Jesus Christ.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C2V6">&nbsp;</a>Wherefore also it is contained in the scripture, Behold, I lay in Sion a chief corner stone, elect, precious:
and he that believeth on him shall not be confounded.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C2V7">&nbsp;</a>Unto you therefore which believe
<span class="add">he is</span> precious: but unto them which be disobedient, the stone which the builders disallowed, the same is made
the head of the corner,
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C2V8">&nbsp;</a>And a stone of stumbling, and a rock of offence,
<span class="add">even to them</span> which stumble at the word, being disobedient: whereunto also they were appointed.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C2V9">&nbsp;</a>But ye
<span class="add">are</span> a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people; that ye should shew forth
the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light:
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C2V10">&nbsp;</a>Which in time past
<span class="add">were</span> not a people, but
<span class="add">are</span> now the people of God: which had not obtained mercy, but now have obtained mercy.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C2V11">&nbsp;</a>Dearly beloved, I beseech
<span class="add">you</span> as strangers and pilgrims, abstain from fleshly lusts, which war against the soul;
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C2V12">&nbsp;</a>Having your conversation honest among the Gentiles: that, whereas they speak against you as evildoers,
they may by
<span class="add">your</span> good works, which they shall behold, glorify God in the day of visitation.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C2V13">&nbsp;</a>Submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the Lord’s sake: whether it be to the king, as supreme;
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C2V14">&nbsp;</a>Or unto governors, as unto them that are sent by him for the punishment of evildoers, and for the praise
of them that do well.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C2V15">&nbsp;</a>For so is the will of God, that with well doing ye may put to silence the ignorance of foolish men:
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C2V16">&nbsp;</a>As free, and not using
<span class="add">your</span> liberty for a cloke of maliciousness, but as the servants of God.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C2V17">&nbsp;</a>Honour all
<span class="add">men.</span> Love the brotherhood. Fear God. Honour the king.
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C2V18">&nbsp;</a>Servants,
<span class="add">be</span> subject to
<span class="add">your</span> masters with all fear; not only to the good and gentle, but also to the froward.
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C2V19">&nbsp;</a>For this
<span class="add">is</span> thankworthy, if a man for conscience toward God endure grief, suffering wrongfully.
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C2V20">&nbsp;</a>For what glory
<span class="add">is it,</span> if, when ye be buffeted for your faults, ye shall take it patiently? but if, when ye do well, and suffer
<span class="add">for it,</span> ye take it patiently, this
<span class="add">is</span> acceptable with God.
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C2V21">&nbsp;</a>For even hereunto were ye called: because Christ also suffered for us, leaving us an example, that ye
should follow his steps:
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C2V22">&nbsp;</a>Who did no sin, neither was guile found in his mouth:
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C2V23">&nbsp;</a>Who, when he was reviled, reviled not again; when he suffered, he threatened not; but committed
<span class="add">himself</span> to him that judgeth righteously:
 <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C2V24">&nbsp;</a>Who his own self bare our sins in his own body on the tree, that we, being dead to sins, should live
unto righteousness: by whose stripes ye were healed.
 <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C2V25">&nbsp;</a>For ye were as sheep going astray; but are now returned unto the Shepherd and Bishop of your souls.
