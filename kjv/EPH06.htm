 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C6V1">&nbsp;</a>Children, obey your parents in the Lord: for this is right.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C6V2">&nbsp;</a>Honour thy father and mother; (which is the first commandment with promise;)
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C6V3">&nbsp;</a>That it may be well with thee, and thou mayest live long on the earth.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C6V4">&nbsp;</a>And, ye fathers, provoke not your children to wrath: but bring them up in the nurture and admonition
of the Lord.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C6V5">&nbsp;</a>Servants, be obedient to them that are
<span class="add">your</span> masters according to the flesh, with fear and trembling, in singleness of your heart, as unto Christ;
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C6V6">&nbsp;</a>Not with eyeservice, as menpleasers; but as the servants of Christ, doing the will of God from the heart;
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C6V7">&nbsp;</a>With good will doing service, as to the Lord, and not to men:
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C6V8">&nbsp;</a>Knowing that whatsoever good thing any man doeth, the same shall he receive of the Lord, whether
<span class="add">he be</span> bond or free.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C6V9">&nbsp;</a>And, ye masters, do the same things unto them, forbearing threatening: knowing that your Master also
is in heaven; neither is there respect of persons with him.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C6V10">&nbsp;</a>Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C6V11">&nbsp;</a>Put on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C6V12">&nbsp;</a>For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers
of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high
<span class="add">places.
</span> <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C6V13">&nbsp;</a>Wherefore take unto you the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day, and
having done all, to stand.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C6V14">&nbsp;</a>Stand therefore, having your loins girt about with truth, and having on the breastplate of righteousness;
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C6V15">&nbsp;</a>And your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace;
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C6V16">&nbsp;</a>Above all, taking the shield of faith, wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the
wicked.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C6V17">&nbsp;</a>And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God:
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C6V18">&nbsp;</a>Praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit, and watching thereunto with all perseverance
and supplication for all saints;
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C6V19">&nbsp;</a>And for me, that utterance may be given unto me, that I may open my mouth boldly, to make known the mystery
of the gospel,
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C6V20">&nbsp;</a>For which I am an ambassador in bonds: that therein I may speak boldly, as I ought to speak.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C6V21">&nbsp;</a>But that ye also may know my affairs,
<span class="add">and</span> how I do, Tychicus, a beloved brother and faithful minister in the Lord, shall make known to you all
things:
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C6V22">&nbsp;</a>Whom I have sent unto you for the same purpose, that ye might know our affairs, and
<span class="add">that</span> he might comfort your hearts.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C6V23">&nbsp;</a>Peace
<span class="add">be</span> to the brethren, and love with faith, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
 <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C6V24">&nbsp;</a>Grace
<span class="add">be</span> with all them that love our Lord Jesus Christ in sincerity. Amen.
