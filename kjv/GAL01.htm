<div class="mt1">The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians
</div>
<div class="chapterlabel"> 1</div><div class="p">
 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C1V1">&nbsp;</a>Paul, an apostle, (not of men, neither by man, but by Jesus Christ, and God the Father, who raised him
from the dead;)
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C1V2">&nbsp;</a>And all the brethren which are with me, unto the churches of Galatia:
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C1V3">&nbsp;</a>Grace
<span class="add">be</span> to you and peace from God the Father, and
<span class="add">from
</span> our Lord Jesus Christ,
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C1V4">&nbsp;</a>Who gave himself for our sins, that he might deliver us from this present evil world, according to the
will of God and our Father:
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C1V5">&nbsp;</a>To whom
<span class="add">be</span> glory for ever and ever. Amen.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C1V6">&nbsp;</a>I marvel that ye are so soon removed from him that called you into the grace of Christ unto another gospel:
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C1V7">&nbsp;</a>Which is not another; but there be some that trouble you, and would pervert the gospel of Christ.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C1V8">&nbsp;</a>But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached
unto you, let him be accursed.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C1V9">&nbsp;</a>As we said before, so say I now again, If any
<span class="add">man</span> preach any other gospel unto you than that ye have received, let him be accursed.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C1V10">&nbsp;</a>For do I now persuade men, or God? or do I seek to please men? for if I yet pleased men, I should not
be the servant of Christ.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C1V11">&nbsp;</a>But I certify you, brethren, that the gospel which was preached of me is not after man.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C1V12">&nbsp;</a>For I neither received it of man, neither was I taught
<span class="add">it,
</span> but by the revelation of Jesus Christ.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C1V13">&nbsp;</a>For ye have heard of my conversation in time past in the Jews’ religion, how that beyond measure I persecuted
the church of God, and wasted it:
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C1V14">&nbsp;</a>And profited in the Jews’ religion above many my equals in mine own nation, being more exceedingly zealous
of the traditions of my fathers.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C1V15">&nbsp;</a>But when it pleased God, who separated me from my mother’s womb, and called
<span class="add">me</span> by his grace,
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C1V16">&nbsp;</a>To reveal his Son in me, that I might preach him among the heathen; immediately I conferred not with
flesh and blood:
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C1V17">&nbsp;</a>Neither went I up to Jerusalem to them which were apostles before me; but I went into Arabia, and returned
again unto Damascus.
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C1V18">&nbsp;</a>Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to see Peter, and abode with him fifteen days.
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C1V19">&nbsp;</a>But other of the apostles saw I none, save James the Lord’s brother.
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C1V20">&nbsp;</a>Now the things which I write unto you, behold, before God, I lie not.
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C1V21">&nbsp;</a>Afterwards I came into the regions of Syria and Cilicia;
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C1V22">&nbsp;</a>And was unknown by face unto the churches of Judaea which were in Christ:
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C1V23">&nbsp;</a>But they had heard only, That he which persecuted us in times past now preacheth the faith which once
he destroyed.
 <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C1V24">&nbsp;</a>And they glorified God in me.
