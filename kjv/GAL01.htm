 <span class="verse" id="V1">1&nbsp;</span> Paul, an apostle, (not of men, neither by man, but by Jesus Christ, and God the Father, who raised him from the dead;)  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span> And all the brethren which are with me, unto the churches of Galatia:  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span> Grace <span class='add'>be</span> to you and peace from God the Father, and <span class='add'>from</span> our Lord Jesus Christ,  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span> Who gave himself for our sins, that he might deliver us from this present evil world, according to the will of God and our Father:  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span> To whom <span class='add'>be</span> glory for ever and ever. Amen. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span> I marvel that ye are so soon removed from him that called you into the grace of Christ unto another gospel:  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span> Which is not another; but there be some that trouble you, and would pervert the gospel of Christ.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span> But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you, let him be accursed.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span> As we said before, so say I now again, If any <span class='add'>man</span> preach any other gospel unto you than that ye have received, let him be accursed. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span> For do I now persuade  men, or God? or do I seek to please men? for if I yet pleased men, I should not be the servant of Christ.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span> But I certify you, brethren, that the gospel which was preached of me is not after man.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span> For I neither received it of man, neither was I taught <span class='add'>it</span>, but by the revelation of Jesus Christ.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span> For ye have heard of my conversation in time past in the Jews’ religion, how that beyond measure I persecuted the church of God, and wasted it:  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span> And profited in the Jews’ religion above many my equals in mine own nation, being more exceedingly zealous of the traditions of my fathers.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span> But when it pleased God, who separated me from my mother’s womb, and called <span class='add'>me</span> by his grace,  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span> To reveal his Son in me, that I might preach him among the heathen; immediately I conferred not with flesh and blood:  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span> Neither went I up to Jerusalem to them which were apostles before me; but I went into Arabia, and returned again unto Damascus.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span> Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to see Peter, and abode with him fifteen days.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span> But other of the apostles saw I none, save James the Lord’s brother.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span> Now the things which I write unto you, behold, before God, I lie not.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span> Afterwards I came into the regions of Syria and Cilicia;  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span> And was unknown by face unto the churches of Judaea which were in Christ:  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span> But they had heard only, That he which persecuted us in times past now preacheth the faith which once he destroyed.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span> And they glorified God in me. </div><ul class='tnav'>
