 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C3V1">&nbsp;</a>By night on my bed I sought him whom my soul loveth: I sought him, but I found him not.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C3V2">&nbsp;</a>I will rise now, and go about the city in the streets, and in the broad ways I will seek him whom my
soul loveth: I sought him, but I found him not.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C3V3">&nbsp;</a>The watchmen that go about the city found me:
<span class="add">to whom I said,
</span> Saw ye him whom my soul loveth?
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C3V4">&nbsp;</a><span class="add">It was</span> but a little that I passed from them, but I found him whom my soul loveth: I held him, and would not
let him go, until I had brought him into my mother’s house, and into the chamber of her that conceived
me.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C3V5">&nbsp;</a>I charge you, O ye daughters of Jerusalem, by the roes, and by the hinds of the field, that ye stir not
up, nor awake
<span class="add">my</span> love, till he please.

<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C3V6">&nbsp;</a>Who
<span class="add">is</span> this that cometh out of the wilderness like pillars of smoke, perfumed with myrrh and frankincense,
with all powders of the merchant?
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C3V7">&nbsp;</a>Behold his bed, which
<span class="add">is</span> Solomon’s; threescore valiant men
<span class="add">are</span> about it, of the valiant of Israel.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C3V8">&nbsp;</a>They all hold swords,
<span class="add">being</span> expert in war: every man
<span class="add">hath</span> his sword upon his thigh because of fear in the night.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C3V9">&nbsp;</a>King Solomon made himself a chariot of the wood of Lebanon.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C3V10">&nbsp;</a>He made the pillars thereof
<span class="add">of</span> silver, the bottom thereof
<span class="add">of</span> gold, the covering of it
<span class="add">of</span> purple, the midst thereof being paved
<span class="add">with</span> love, for the daughters of Jerusalem.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C3V11">&nbsp;</a>Go forth, O ye daughters of Zion, and behold king Solomon with the crown wherewith his mother crowned
him in the day of his espousals, and in the day of the gladness of his heart.
