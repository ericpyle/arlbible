 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C21V1">&nbsp;</a>And the LORD visited Sarah as he had said, and the LORD did unto Sarah as he had spoken.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C21V2">&nbsp;</a>For Sarah conceived, and bare Abraham a son in his old age, at the set time of which God had spoken to
him.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C21V3">&nbsp;</a>And Abraham called the name of his son that was born unto him, whom Sarah bare to him, Isaac.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C21V4">&nbsp;</a>And Abraham circumcised his son Isaac being eight days old, as God had commanded him.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C21V5">&nbsp;</a>And Abraham was an hundred years old, when his son Isaac was born unto him.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C21V6">&nbsp;</a>And Sarah said, God hath made me to laugh,
<span class="add">so that</span> all that hear will laugh with me.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C21V7">&nbsp;</a>And she said, Who would have said unto Abraham, that Sarah should have given children suck? for I have
born
<span class="add">him</span> a son in his old age.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C21V8">&nbsp;</a>And the child grew, and was weaned: and Abraham made a great feast the
<span class="add">same</span> day that Isaac was weaned.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C21V9">&nbsp;</a>And Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, which she had born unto Abraham, mocking.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C21V10">&nbsp;</a>Wherefore she said unto Abraham, Cast out this bondwoman and her son: for the son of this bondwoman shall
not be heir with my son,
<span class="add">even</span> with Isaac.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C21V11">&nbsp;</a>And the thing was very grievous in Abraham’s sight because of his son.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C21V12">&nbsp;</a>And God said unto Abraham, Let it not be grievous in thy sight because of the lad, and because of thy
bondwoman; in all that Sarah hath said unto thee, hearken unto her voice; for in Isaac shall thy seed
be called.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C21V13">&nbsp;</a>And also of the son of the bondwoman will I make a nation, because he
<span class="add">is</span> thy seed.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C21V14">&nbsp;</a>And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and took bread, and a bottle of water, and gave
<span class="add">it</span> unto Hagar, putting
<span class="add">it</span> on her shoulder, and the child, and sent her away: and she departed, and wandered in the wilderness
of Beer-sheba.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C21V15">&nbsp;</a>And the water was spent in the bottle, and she cast the child under one of the shrubs.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C21V16">&nbsp;</a>And she went, and sat her down over against
<span class="add">him</span> a good way off, as it were a bowshot: for she said, Let me not see the death of the child. And she sat
over against
<span class="add">him,</span> and lift up her voice, and wept.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C21V17">&nbsp;</a>And God heard the voice of the lad; and the angel of God called Hagar out of heaven, and said unto her,
What aileth thee, Hagar? fear not; for God hath heard the voice of the lad where he
<span class="add">is.
</span> <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C21V18">&nbsp;</a>Arise, lift up the lad, and hold him in thine hand; for I will make him a great nation.
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C21V19">&nbsp;</a>And God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water; and she went, and filled the bottle with water,
and gave the lad drink.
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C21V20">&nbsp;</a>And God was with the lad; and he grew, and dwelt in the wilderness, and became an archer.
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C21V21">&nbsp;</a>And he dwelt in the wilderness of Paran: and his mother took him a wife out of the land of Egypt.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C21V22">&nbsp;</a>And it came to pass at that time, that Abimelech and Phichol the chief captain of his host spake unto
Abraham, saying, God
<span class="add">is</span> with thee in all that thou doest:
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C21V23">&nbsp;</a>Now therefore swear unto me here by God that thou wilt not deal falsely with me, nor with my son, nor
with my son’s son:
<span class="add">but</span> according to the kindness that I have done unto thee, thou shalt do unto me, and to the land wherein
thou hast sojourned.
 <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C21V24">&nbsp;</a>And Abraham said, I will swear.
 <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C21V25">&nbsp;</a>And Abraham reproved Abimelech because of a well of water, which Abimelech’s servants had violently taken
away.
 <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C21V26">&nbsp;</a>And Abimelech said, I wot not who hath done this thing: neither didst thou tell me, neither yet heard
I
<span class="add">of it,</span> but to day.
 <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C21V27">&nbsp;</a>And Abraham took sheep and oxen, and gave them unto Abimelech; and both of them made a covenant.
 <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C21V28">&nbsp;</a>And Abraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock by themselves.
 <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C21V29">&nbsp;</a>And Abimelech said unto Abraham, What
<span class="add">mean</span> these seven ewe lambs which thou hast set by themselves?
 <span class="verse"> 30</span><a name="C21V30">&nbsp;</a>And he said, For
<span class="add">these</span> seven ewe lambs shalt thou take of my hand, that they may be a witness unto me, that I have digged this
well.
 <span class="verse"> 31</span><a name="C21V31">&nbsp;</a>Wherefore he called that place Beer-sheba; because there they sware both of them.
 <span class="verse"> 32</span><a name="C21V32">&nbsp;</a>Thus they made a covenant at Beer-sheba: then Abimelech rose up, and Phichol the chief captain of his
host, and they returned into the land of the Philistines.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 33</span><a name="C21V33">&nbsp;</a>And
<span class="add">Abraham</span> planted a grove in Beer-sheba, and called there on the name of the LORD, the everlasting God.
 <span class="verse"> 34</span><a name="C21V34">&nbsp;</a>And Abraham sojourned in the Philistines’ land many days.
