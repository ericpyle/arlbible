 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C4V1">&nbsp;</a>So king Solomon was king over all Israel.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C4V2">&nbsp;</a>And these

 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C4V7">&nbsp;</a>And Solomon had twelve officers over all Israel, which provided victuals for the king and his household:

 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C4V12">&nbsp;</a>Baana the son of Ahilud;
<span class="add">to him pertained</span> Taanach and Megiddo, and all Beth-shean, which is by Zartanah beneath Jezreel, from Beth-shean to Abel-meholah,
<span class="add">even</span> unto
<span class="add">the place that is</span> beyond Jokneam:

<span class="add">he was</span> the only officer which
<span class="add">was</span> in the land.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C4V20">&nbsp;</a>Judah and Israel
<span class="add">were</span> many, as the sand which
<span class="add">is
</span> by the sea in multitude, eating and drinking, and making merry.
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C4V21">&nbsp;</a>And Solomon reigned over all kingdoms from the river unto the land of the Philistines, and unto the border
of Egypt: they brought presents, and served Solomon all the days of his life.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C4V22">&nbsp;</a>And Solomon’s provision for one day was thirty measures of fine flour, and threescore measures of meal,
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C4V23">&nbsp;</a>Ten fat oxen, and twenty oxen out of the pastures, and an hundred sheep, beside harts, and roebucks,
and fallowdeer, and fatted fowl.
 <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C4V24">&nbsp;</a>For he had dominion over all
<span class="add">the region</span> on this side the river, from Tiphsah even to Azzah, over all the kings on this side the river: and he
had peace on all sides round about him.
 <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C4V25">&nbsp;</a>And Judah and Israel dwelt safely, every man under his vine and under his fig tree, from Dan even to
Beer-sheba, all the days of Solomon.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C4V26">&nbsp;</a>And Solomon had forty thousand stalls of horses for his chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen.
 <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C4V27">&nbsp;</a>And those officers provided victual for king Solomon, and for all that came unto king Solomon’s table,
every man in his month: they lacked nothing.
 <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C4V28">&nbsp;</a>Barley also and straw for the horses and dromedaries brought they unto the place where
<span class="add">the officers</span> were, every man according to his charge.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C4V29">&nbsp;</a>And God gave Solomon wisdom and understanding exceeding much, and largeness of heart, even as the sand
that
<span class="add">is</span> on the sea shore.
 <span class="verse"> 30</span><a name="C4V30">&nbsp;</a>And Solomon’s wisdom excelled the wisdom of all the children of the east country, and all the wisdom
of Egypt.
 <span class="verse"> 31</span><a name="C4V31">&nbsp;</a>For he was wiser than all men; than Ethan the Ezrahite, and Heman, and Chalcol, and Darda, the sons of
Mahol: and his fame was in all nations round about.
 <span class="verse"> 32</span><a name="C4V32">&nbsp;</a>And he spake three thousand proverbs: and his songs were a thousand and five.
 <span class="verse"> 33</span><a name="C4V33">&nbsp;</a>And he spake of trees, from the cedar tree that
<span class="add">is</span> in Lebanon even unto the hyssop that springeth out of the wall: he spake also of beasts, and of fowl,
and of creeping things, and of fishes.
 <span class="verse"> 34</span><a name="C4V34">&nbsp;</a>And there came of all people to hear the wisdom of Solomon, from all kings of the earth, which had heard
of his wisdom.
