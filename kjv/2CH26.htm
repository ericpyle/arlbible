 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C26V1">&nbsp;</a>Then all the people of Judah took Uzziah, who
<span class="add">was</span> sixteen years old, and made him king in the room of his father Amaziah.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C26V2">&nbsp;</a>He built Eloth, and restored it to Judah, after that the king slept with his fathers.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C26V3">&nbsp;</a>Sixteen years old
<span class="add">was</span> Uzziah when he began to reign, and he reigned fifty and two years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name also
was Jecoliah of Jerusalem.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C26V4">&nbsp;</a>And he did
<span class="add">that which was</span> right in the sight of the LORD, according to all that his father Amaziah did.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C26V5">&nbsp;</a>And he sought God in the days of Zechariah, who had understanding in the visions of God: and as long
as he sought the LORD, God made him to prosper.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C26V6">&nbsp;</a>And he went forth and warred against the Philistines, and brake down the wall of Gath, and the wall of
Jabneh, and the wall of Ashdod, and built cities about Ashdod, and among the Philistines.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C26V7">&nbsp;</a>And God helped him against the Philistines, and against the Arabians that dwelt in Gur-baal, and the
Mehunims.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C26V8">&nbsp;</a>And the Ammonites gave gifts to Uzziah: and his name spread abroad
<span class="add">even</span> to the entering in of Egypt; for he strengthened
<span class="add">himself</span> exceedingly.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C26V9">&nbsp;</a>Moreover Uzziah built towers in Jerusalem at the corner gate, and at the valley gate, and at the turning
<span class="add">of the wall,</span> and fortified them.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C26V10">&nbsp;</a>Also he built towers in the desert, and digged many wells: for he had much cattle, both in the low country,
and in the plains: husbandmen
<span class="add">also,</span> and vine dressers in the mountains, and in Carmel: for he loved husbandry.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C26V11">&nbsp;</a>Moreover Uzziah had an host of fighting men, that went out to war by bands, according to the number of
their account by the hand of Jeiel the scribe and Maaseiah the ruler, under the hand of Hananiah,
<span class="add">one</span> of the king’s captains.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C26V12">&nbsp;</a>The whole number of the chief of the fathers of the mighty men of valour
<span class="add">were</span> two thousand and six hundred.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C26V13">&nbsp;</a>And under their hand
<span class="add">was</span> an army, three hundred thousand and seven thousand and five hundred, that made war with mighty power,
to help the king against the enemy.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C26V14">&nbsp;</a>And Uzziah prepared for them throughout all the host shields, and spears, and helmets, and habergeons,
and bows, and slings
<span class="add">to cast</span> stones.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C26V15">&nbsp;</a>And he made in Jerusalem engines, invented by cunning men, to be on the towers and upon the bulwarks,
to shoot arrows and great stones withal. And his name spread far abroad; for he was marvellously helped,
till he was strong.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C26V16">&nbsp;</a>But when he was strong, his heart was lifted up to
<span class="add">his</span> destruction: for he transgressed against the LORD his God, and went into the temple of the LORD to burn
incense upon the altar of incense.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C26V17">&nbsp;</a>And Azariah the priest went in after him, and with him fourscore priests of the LORD,
<span class="add">that were</span> valiant men:
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C26V18">&nbsp;</a>And they withstood Uzziah the king, and said unto him,
<span class="add">It appertaineth</span> not unto thee, Uzziah, to burn incense unto the LORD, but to the priests the sons of Aaron, that are
consecrated to burn incense: go out of the sanctuary; for thou hast trespassed; neither
<span class="add">shall it be</span> for thine honour from the LORD God.
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C26V19">&nbsp;</a>Then Uzziah was wroth, and
<span class="add">had</span> a censer in his hand to burn incense: and while he was wroth with the priests, the leprosy even rose
up in his forehead before the priests in the house of the LORD, from beside the incense altar.
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C26V20">&nbsp;</a>And Azariah the chief priest, and all the priests, looked upon him, and, behold, he
<span class="add">was</span> leprous in his forehead, and they thrust him out from thence; yea, himself hasted also to go out, because
the LORD had smitten him.
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C26V21">&nbsp;</a>And Uzziah the king was a leper unto the day of his death, and dwelt in a several house,
<span class="add">being</span> a leper; for he was cut off from the house of the LORD: and Jotham his son
<span class="add">was</span> over the king’s house, judging the people of the land.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C26V22">&nbsp;</a>Now the rest of the acts of Uzziah, first and last, did Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz, write.
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C26V23">&nbsp;</a>So Uzziah slept with his fathers, and they buried him with his fathers in the field of the burial which
<span class="add">belonged</span> to the kings; for they said, He
<span class="add">is</span> a leper: and Jotham his son reigned in his stead.
