 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C9V1">&nbsp;</a>I saw the LORD standing upon the altar: and he said, Smite the lintel of the door, that the posts may
shake: and cut them in the head, all of them; and I will slay the last of them with the sword: he that
fleeth of them shall not flee away, and he that escapeth of them shall not be delivered.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C9V2">&nbsp;</a>Though they dig into hell, thence shall mine hand take them; though they climb up to heaven, thence will
I bring them down:
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C9V3">&nbsp;</a>And though they hide themselves in the top of Carmel, I will search and take them out thence; and though
they be hid from my sight in the bottom of the sea, thence will I command the serpent, and he shall bite
them:
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C9V4">&nbsp;</a>And though they go into captivity before their enemies, thence will I command the sword, and it shall
slay them: and I will set mine eyes upon them for evil, and not for good.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C9V5">&nbsp;</a>And the Lord GOD of hosts
<span class="add">is</span> he that toucheth the land, and it shall melt, and all that dwell therein shall mourn: and it shall rise
up wholly like a flood; and shall be drowned, as
<span class="add">by</span> the flood of Egypt.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C9V6">&nbsp;</a><span class="add">It is</span> he that buildeth his stories in the heaven, and hath founded his troop in the earth; he that calleth
for the waters of the sea, and poureth them out upon the face of the earth: The LORD
<span class="add">is</span> his name.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C9V7">&nbsp;</a><span class="add">Are</span> ye not as children of the Ethiopians unto me, O children of Israel? saith the LORD. Have not I brought
up Israel out of the land of Egypt? and the Philistines from Caphtor, and the Syrians from Kir?
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C9V8">&nbsp;</a>Behold, the eyes of the Lord GOD
<span class="add">are</span> upon the sinful kingdom, and I will destroy it from off the face of the earth; saving that I will not
utterly destroy the house of Jacob, saith the LORD.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C9V9">&nbsp;</a>For, lo, I will command, and I will sift the house of Israel among all nations, like as
<span class="add">corn</span> is sifted in a sieve, yet shall not the least grain fall upon the earth.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C9V10">&nbsp;</a>All the sinners of my people shall die by the sword, which say, The evil shall not overtake nor prevent
us.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C9V11">&nbsp;</a>In that day will I raise up the tabernacle of David that is fallen, and close up the breaches thereof;
and I will raise up his ruins, and I will build it as in the days of old:
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C9V12">&nbsp;</a>That they may possess the remnant of Edom, and of all the heathen, which are called by my name, saith
the LORD that doeth this.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C9V13">&nbsp;</a>Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that the plowman shall overtake the reaper, and the treader of
grapes him that soweth seed; and the mountains shall drop sweet wine, and all the hills shall melt.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C9V14">&nbsp;</a>And I will bring again the captivity of my people of Israel, and they shall build the waste cities, and
inhabit
<span class="add">them;</span> and they shall plant vineyards, and drink the wine thereof; they shall also make gardens, and eat the
fruit of them.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C9V15">&nbsp;</a>And I will plant them upon their land, and they shall no more be pulled up out of their land which I
have given them, saith the LORD thy God.
