 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C5V1">&nbsp;</a>The elders which are among you I exhort, who am also an elder, and a witness of the sufferings of Christ,
and also a partaker of the glory that shall be revealed:
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C5V2">&nbsp;</a>Feed the flock of God which is among you, taking the oversight
<span class="add">thereof,</span> not by constraint, but willingly; not for filthy lucre, but of a ready mind;
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C5V3">&nbsp;</a>Neither as being lords over
<span class="add">God’s</span> heritage, but being ensamples to the flock.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C5V4">&nbsp;</a>And when the chief Shepherd shall appear, ye shall receive a crown of glory that fadeth not away.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C5V5">&nbsp;</a>Likewise, ye younger, submit yourselves unto the elder. Yea, all
<span class="add">of you</span> be subject one to another, and be clothed with humility: for God resisteth the proud, and giveth grace
to the humble.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C5V6">&nbsp;</a>Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in due time:
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C5V7">&nbsp;</a>Casting all your care upon him; for he careth for you.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C5V8">&nbsp;</a>Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom
he may devour:
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C5V9">&nbsp;</a>Whom resist stedfast in the faith, knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren
that are in the world.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C5V10">&nbsp;</a>But the God of all grace, who hath called us unto his eternal glory by Christ Jesus, after that ye have
suffered a while, make you perfect, stablish, strengthen, settle
<span class="add">you.
</span> <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C5V11">&nbsp;</a>To him
<span class="add">be</span> glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C5V12">&nbsp;</a>By Silvanus, a faithful brother unto you, as I suppose, I have written briefly, exhorting, and testifying
that this is the true grace of God wherein ye stand.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C5V13">&nbsp;</a>The
<span class="add">church that is</span> at Babylon, elected together with
<span class="add">you,</span> saluteth you; and
<span class="add">so doth</span> Marcus my son.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C5V14">&nbsp;</a>Greet ye one another with a kiss of charity. Peace
<span class="add">be</span> with you all that are in Christ Jesus. Amen.
