 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C50V1">&nbsp;</a>And Joseph fell upon his father’s face, and wept upon him, and kissed him.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C50V2">&nbsp;</a>And Joseph commanded his servants the physicians to embalm his father: and the physicians embalmed Israel.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C50V3">&nbsp;</a>And forty days were fulfilled for him; for so are fulfilled the days of those which are embalmed: and
the Egyptians mourned for him threescore and ten days.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C50V4">&nbsp;</a>And when the days of his mourning were past, Joseph spake unto the house of Pharaoh, saying, If now I
have found grace in your eyes, speak, I pray you, in the ears of Pharaoh, saying,
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C50V5">&nbsp;</a>My father made me swear, saying, Lo, I die: in my grave which I have digged for me in the land of Canaan,
there shalt thou bury me. Now therefore let me go up, I pray thee, and bury my father, and I will come
again.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C50V6">&nbsp;</a>And Pharaoh said, Go up, and bury thy father, according as he made thee swear.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C50V7">&nbsp;</a>And Joseph went up to bury his father: and with him went up all the servants of Pharaoh, the elders of
his house, and all the elders of the land of Egypt,
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C50V8">&nbsp;</a>And all the house of Joseph, and his brethren, and his father’s house: only their little ones, and their
flocks, and their herds, they left in the land of Goshen.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C50V9">&nbsp;</a>And there went up with him both chariots and horsemen: and it was a very great company.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C50V10">&nbsp;</a>And they came to the threshingfloor of Atad, which
<span class="add">is</span> beyond Jordan, and there they mourned with a great and very sore lamentation: and he made a mourning
for his father seven days.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C50V11">&nbsp;</a>And when the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, saw the mourning in the floor of Atad, they said,
This
<span class="add">is</span> a grievous mourning to the Egyptians: wherefore the name of it was called Abel-mizraim, which
<span class="add">is
</span> beyond Jordan.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C50V12">&nbsp;</a>And his sons did unto him according as he commanded them:
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C50V13">&nbsp;</a>For his sons carried him into the land of Canaan, and buried him in the cave of the field of Machpelah,
which Abraham bought with the field for a possession of a buryingplace of Ephron the Hittite, before
Mamre.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C50V14">&nbsp;</a>And Joseph returned into Egypt, he, and his brethren, and all that went up with him to bury his father,
after he had buried his father.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C50V15">&nbsp;</a>And when Joseph’s brethren saw that their father was dead, they said, Joseph will peradventure hate us,
and will certainly requite us all the evil which we did unto him.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C50V16">&nbsp;</a>And they sent a messenger unto Joseph, saying, Thy father did command before he died, saying,
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C50V17">&nbsp;</a>So shall ye say unto Joseph, Forgive, I pray thee now, the trespass of thy brethren, and their sin; for
they did unto thee evil: and now, we pray thee, forgive the trespass of the servants of the God of thy
father. And Joseph wept when they spake unto him.
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C50V18">&nbsp;</a>And his brethren also went and fell down before his face; and they said, Behold, we
<span class="add">be</span> thy servants.
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C50V19">&nbsp;</a>And Joseph said unto them, Fear not: for
<span class="add">am</span> I in the place of God?
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C50V20">&nbsp;</a>But as for you, ye thought evil against me;
<span class="add">but</span> God meant it unto good, to bring to pass, as
<span class="add">it is</span> this day, to save much people alive.
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C50V21">&nbsp;</a>Now therefore fear ye not: I will nourish you, and your little ones. And he comforted them, and spake
kindly unto them.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C50V22">&nbsp;</a>And Joseph dwelt in Egypt, he, and his father’s house: and Joseph lived an hundred and ten years.
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C50V23">&nbsp;</a>And Joseph saw Ephraim’s children of the third
<span class="add">generation:
</span> the children also of Machir the son Manasseh were brought up upon Joseph’s knees.
 <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C50V24">&nbsp;</a>And Joseph said unto his brethren, I die: and God will surely visit you, and bring you out of this land
unto the land which he sware to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.
 <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C50V25">&nbsp;</a>And Joseph took an oath of the children of Israel, saying, God will surely visit you, and ye shall carry
up my bones from hence.
 <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C50V26">&nbsp;</a>So Joseph died,
<span class="add">being</span> an hundred and ten years old: and they embalmed him, and he was put in a coffin in Egypt.
