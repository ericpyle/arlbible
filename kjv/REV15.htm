 <span class="verse" id="V1">1&nbsp;</span> And I saw another sign in heaven, great and marvellous, seven angels having the seven last plagues; for in them is filled up the wrath of God.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span> And I saw as it were a sea of glass mingled with fire: and them that had gotten the victory over the beast, and over his image, and over his mark, <span class='add'>and</span> over the number of his name, stand on the sea of glass, having the harps of God.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span> And they sing the song of Moses the servant of God, and the song of the Lamb, saying, Great and marvellous <span class='add'>are</span> thy works, Lord God Almighty; just and true <span class='add'>are</span> thy ways, thou King of saints.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span> Who shall not fear thee, O Lord, and glorify thy name? for <span class='add'>thou</span> only <span class='add'>art</span> holy: for all nations shall come and worship before thee; for thy judgments are made manifest.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span> And after that I looked, and, behold, the temple of the tabernacle of the testimony in heaven was opened:  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span> And the seven angels came out of the temple, having the seven plagues, clothed in pure and white linen, and having their breasts girded with golden girdles.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span> And one of the four beasts gave unto the seven angels seven golden vials full of the wrath of God, who liveth for ever and ever.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span> And the temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God, and from his power; and no man was able to enter into the temple, till the seven plagues of the seven angels were fulfilled. </div><ul class='tnav'>
