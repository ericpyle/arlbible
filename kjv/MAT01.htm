<div class="chapterlabel"> 1</div><div class="p">
 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C1V1">&nbsp;</a>The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C1V2">&nbsp;</a>Abraham begat Isaac; and Isaac begat Jacob; and Jacob begat Judas and his brethren;
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C1V3">&nbsp;</a>And Judas begat Phares and Zara of Thamar; and Phares begat Esrom; and Esrom begat Aram;
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C1V4">&nbsp;</a>And Aram begat Aminadab; and Aminadab begat Naasson; and Naasson begat Salmon;
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C1V5">&nbsp;</a>And Salmon begat Booz of Rachab; and Booz begat Obed of Ruth; and Obed begat Jesse;
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C1V6">&nbsp;</a>And Jesse begat David the king; and David the king begat Solomon of her
<span class="add">that had been the wife</span> of Urias;
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C1V7">&nbsp;</a>And Solomon begat Roboam; and Roboam begat Abia; and Abia begat Asa;
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C1V8">&nbsp;</a>And Asa begat Josaphat; and Josaphat begat Joram; and Joram begat Ozias;
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C1V9">&nbsp;</a>And Ozias begat Joatham; and Joatham begat Achaz; and Achaz begat Ezekias;
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C1V10">&nbsp;</a>And Ezekias begat Manasses; and Manasses begat Amon; and Amon begat Josias;
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C1V11">&nbsp;</a>And Josias begat Jechonias and his brethren, about the time they were carried away to Babylon:
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C1V12">&nbsp;</a>And after they were brought to Babylon, Jechonias begat Salathiel; and Salathiel begat Zorobabel;
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C1V13">&nbsp;</a>And Zorobabel begat Abiud; and Abiud begat Eliakim; and Eliakim begat Azor;
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C1V14">&nbsp;</a>And Azor begat Sadoc; and Sadoc begat Achim; and Achim begat Eliud;
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C1V15">&nbsp;</a>And Eliud begat Eleazar; and Eleazar begat Matthan; and Matthan begat Jacob;
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C1V16">&nbsp;</a>And Jacob begat Joseph the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus, who is called Christ.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C1V17">&nbsp;</a>So all the generations from Abraham to David
<span class="add">are</span> fourteen generations; and from David until the carrying away into Babylon
<span class="add">are
</span> fourteen generations; and from the carrying away into Babylon unto Christ
<span class="add">are</span> fourteen generations.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C1V18">&nbsp;</a>Now the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise: When as his mother Mary was espoused to Joseph, before
they came together, she was found with child of the Holy Ghost.
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C1V19">&nbsp;</a>Then Joseph her husband, being a just
<span class="add">man,</span> and not willing to make her a publick example, was minded to put her away privily.
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C1V20">&nbsp;</a>But while he thought on these things, behold, the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a dream, saying,
Joseph, thou son of David, fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife: for that which is conceived in her
is of the Holy Ghost.
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C1V21">&nbsp;</a>And she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name JESUS: for he shall save his people from
their sins.
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C1V22">&nbsp;</a>Now all this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet, saying,
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C1V23">&nbsp;</a>Behold, a virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel,
which being interpreted is, God with us.
 <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C1V24">&nbsp;</a>Then Joseph being raised from sleep did as the angel of the Lord had bidden him, and took unto him his
wife:
 <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C1V25">&nbsp;</a>And knew her not till she had brought forth her firstborn son: and he called his name JESUS.
