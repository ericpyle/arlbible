 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C24V1">&nbsp;</a>And when Balaam saw that it pleased the LORD to bless Israel, he went not, as at other times, to seek
for enchantments, but he set his face toward the wilderness.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C24V2">&nbsp;</a>And Balaam lifted up his eyes, and he saw Israel abiding
<span class="add">in his tents</span> according to their tribes; and the spirit of God came upon him.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C24V3">&nbsp;</a>And he took up his parable, and said, Balaam the son of Beor hath said, and the man whose eyes are open
hath said:
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C24V4">&nbsp;</a>He hath said, which heard the words of God, which saw the vision of the Almighty, falling
<span class="add">into a trance,</span> but having his eyes open:
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C24V5">&nbsp;</a>How goodly are thy tents, O Jacob,
<span class="add">and</span> thy tabernacles, O Israel!
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C24V6">&nbsp;</a>As the valleys are they spread forth, as gardens by the river’s side, as the trees of lign aloes which
the LORD hath planted,
<span class="add">and</span> as cedar trees beside the waters.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C24V7">&nbsp;</a>He shall pour the water out of his buckets, and his seed
<span class="add">shall be
</span> in many waters, and his king shall be higher than Agag, and his kingdom shall be exalted.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C24V8">&nbsp;</a>God brought him forth out of Egypt; he hath as it were the strength of an unicorn: he shall eat up the
nations his enemies, and shall break their bones, and pierce
<span class="add">them</span> through with his arrows.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C24V9">&nbsp;</a>He couched, he lay down as a lion, and as a great lion: who shall stir him up? Blessed
<span class="add">is</span> he that blesseth thee, and cursed is he that curseth thee.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C24V10">&nbsp;</a>And Balak’s anger was kindled against Balaam, and he smote his hands together: and Balak said unto Balaam,
I called thee to curse mine enemies, and, behold, thou hast altogether blessed
<span class="add">them</span> these three times.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C24V11">&nbsp;</a>Therefore now flee thou to thy place: I thought to promote thee unto great honour; but, lo, the LORD
hath kept thee back from honour.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C24V12">&nbsp;</a>And Balaam said unto Balak, Spake I not also to thy messengers which thou sentest unto me, saying,
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C24V13">&nbsp;</a>If Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold, I cannot go beyond the commandment of the LORD,
to do
<span class="add">either</span> good or bad of mine own mind;
<span class="add">but</span> what the LORD saith, that will I speak?
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C24V14">&nbsp;</a>And now, behold, I go unto my people: come
<span class="add">therefore, and
</span> I will advertise thee what this people shall do to thy people in the latter days.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C24V15">&nbsp;</a>And he took up his parable, and said, Balaam the son of Beor hath said, and the man whose eyes are open
hath said:
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C24V16">&nbsp;</a>He hath said, which heard the words of God, and knew the knowledge of the most High,
<span class="add">which</span> saw the vision of the Almighty, falling
<span class="add">into a trance,</span> but having his eyes open:
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C24V17">&nbsp;</a>I shall see him, but not now: I shall behold him, but not nigh: there shall come a Star out of Jacob,
and a Sceptre shall rise out of Israel, and shall smite the corners of Moab, and destroy all the children
of Sheth.
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C24V18">&nbsp;</a>And Edom shall be a possession, Seir also shall be a possession for his enemies; and Israel shall do
valiantly.
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C24V19">&nbsp;</a>Out of Jacob shall come he that shall have dominion, and shall destroy him that remaineth of the city.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C24V20">&nbsp;</a>And when he looked on Amalek, he took up his parable, and said, Amalek
<span class="add">was</span> the first of the nations; but his latter end
<span class="add">shall be
</span> that he perish for ever.
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C24V21">&nbsp;</a>And he looked on the Kenites, and took up his parable, and said, Strong is thy dwellingplace, and thou
puttest thy nest in a rock.
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C24V22">&nbsp;</a>Nevertheless the Kenite shall be wasted, until Asshur shall carry thee away captive.
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C24V23">&nbsp;</a>And he took up his parable, and said, Alas, who shall live when God doeth this!
 <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C24V24">&nbsp;</a>And ships
<span class="add">shall come</span> from the coast of Chittim, and shall afflict Asshur, and shall afflict Eber, and he also shall perish
for ever.
 <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C24V25">&nbsp;</a>And Balaam rose up, and went and returned to his place: and Balak also went his way.
