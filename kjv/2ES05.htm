<div class="chapterlabel"> 5</div><div class="p">
 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C5V1">&nbsp;</a>Nevertheless as coming the tokens, behold, the days shall come, that they which dwell upon earth shall
be taken in a great number, and the way of truth shall be hidden, and the land shall be barren of faith.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C5V2">&nbsp;</a>But iniquity shall be increased above that which now thou seest, or that thou hast heard long ago.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C5V3">&nbsp;</a>And the land, that thou seest now to have root, shalt thou see wasted suddenly.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C5V4">&nbsp;</a>But if the most High grant thee to live, thou shalt see after the third trumpet that the sun shall suddenly
shine again in the night, and the moon thrice in the day:
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C5V5">&nbsp;</a>And blood shall drop out of wood, and the stone shall give his voice, and the people shall be troubled:
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C5V6">&nbsp;</a>And even he shall rule, whom they look not for that dwell upon the earth, and the fowls shall take their
flight away together:
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C5V7">&nbsp;</a>And the Sodomitish sea shall cast out fish, and make a noise in the night, which many have not known:
but they shall all hear the voice thereof.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C5V8">&nbsp;</a>There shall be a confusion also in many places, and the fire shall be oft sent out again, and the wild
beasts shall change their places, and menstruous women shall bring forth monsters:
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C5V9">&nbsp;</a>And salt waters shall be found in the sweet, and all friends shall destroy one another; then shall wit
hide itself, and understanding withdraw itself into his secret chamber,
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C5V10">&nbsp;</a>And shall be sought of many, and yet not be found: then shall unrighteousness and incontinency be multiplied
upon earth.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C5V11">&nbsp;</a>One land also shall ask another, and say, Is righteousness that maketh a man righteous gone through thee?
And it shall say, No.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C5V12">&nbsp;</a>At the same time shall men hope, but nothing obtain: they shall labour, but their ways shall not prosper.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C5V13">&nbsp;</a>To shew thee such tokens I have leave; and if thou wilt pray again, and weep as now, and fast even days,
thou shalt hear yet greater things.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C5V14">&nbsp;</a>Then I awaked, and an extreme fearfulness went through all my body, and my mind was troubled, so that
it fainted.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C5V15">&nbsp;</a>So the angel that was come to talk with me held me, comforted me, and set me up upon my feet.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C5V16">&nbsp;</a>And in the second night it came to pass, that Salathiel the captain of the people came unto me, saying,
Where hast thou been? and why is thy countenance so heavy?
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C5V17">&nbsp;</a>Knowest thou not that Israel is committed unto thee in the land of their captivity?
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C5V18">&nbsp;</a>Up then, and eat bread, and forsake us not, as the shepherd that leaveth his flock in the hands of cruel
wolves.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C5V19">&nbsp;</a>Then said I unto him, Go thy ways from me, and come not nigh me. And he heard what I said, and went from
me.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C5V20">&nbsp;</a>And so I fasted seven days, mourning and weeping, like as Uriel the angel commanded me.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C5V21">&nbsp;</a>And after seven days so it was, that the thoughts of my heart were very grievous unto me again,
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C5V22">&nbsp;</a>And my soul recovered the spirit of understanding, and I began to talk with the most High again,
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C5V23">&nbsp;</a>And said, O Lord that bearest rule, of every wood of the earth, and of all the trees thereof, thou hast
chosen thee one only vine:
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C5V24">&nbsp;</a>And of all lands of the whole world thou hast chosen thee one pit: and of all the flowers thereof one
lily:
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C5V25">&nbsp;</a>And of all the depths of the sea thou hast filled thee one river: and of all builded cities thou hast
hallowed Sion unto thyself:
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C5V26">&nbsp;</a>And of all the fowls that are created thou hast named thee one dove: and of all the cattle that are made
thou hast provided thee one sheep:
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C5V27">&nbsp;</a>And among all the multitudes of people thou hast gotten thee one people: and unto this people, whom thou
lovedst, thou gavest a law that is approved of all.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C5V28">&nbsp;</a>And now, O Lord, why hast thou given this one people over unto many? and upon the one root hast thou
prepared others, and why hast thou scattered thy only one people among many?
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C5V29">&nbsp;</a>And they which did gainsay thy promises, and believed not thy covenants, have trodden them down.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 30</span><a name="C5V30">&nbsp;</a>If thou didst so much hate thy people, yet shouldest thou punish them with thine own hands.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 31</span><a name="C5V31">&nbsp;</a>Now when I had spoken these words, the angel that came to me the night afore was sent unto me,
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 32</span><a name="C5V32">&nbsp;</a>And said unto me, Hear me, and I will instruct thee; hearken to the thing that I say, and I shall tell
thee more.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 33</span><a name="C5V33">&nbsp;</a>And I said, Speak on, my Lord. Then said he unto me, Thou art sore troubled in mind for Israel’s sake:
lovest thou that people better than he that made them?
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 34</span><a name="C5V34">&nbsp;</a>And I said, No, Lord: but of very grief have I spoken: for my reins pain me every hour, while I labour
to comprehend the way of the most High, and to seek out part of his judgment.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 35</span><a name="C5V35">&nbsp;</a>And he said unto me, Thou canst not. And I said, Wherefore, Lord? whereunto was I born then? or why was
not my mother’s womb then my grave, that I might not have seen the travail of Jacob, and the wearisome
toil of the stock of Israel?
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 36</span><a name="C5V36">&nbsp;</a>And he said unto me, Number me the things that are not yet come, gather me together the dross that are
scattered abroad, make me the flowers green again that are withered,
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 37</span><a name="C5V37">&nbsp;</a>Open me the places that are closed, and bring me forth the winds that in them are shut up, shew me the
image of a voice: and then I will declare to thee the thing that thou labourest to know.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 38</span><a name="C5V38">&nbsp;</a>And I said, O Lord that bearest rule, who may know these things, but he that hath not his dwelling with
men?
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 39</span><a name="C5V39">&nbsp;</a>As for me, I am unwise: how may I then speak of these things whereof thou askest me?
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 40</span><a name="C5V40">&nbsp;</a>Then said he unto me, Like as thou canst do none of these things that I have spoken of, even so canst
thou not find out my judgment, or in the end the love that I have promised unto my people.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 41</span><a name="C5V41">&nbsp;</a>And I said, Behold, O Lord, yet art thou nigh unto them that be reserved till the end: and what shall
they do that have been before me, or we that be now, or they that shall come after us?
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 42</span><a name="C5V42">&nbsp;</a>And he said unto me, I will liken my judgment unto a ring: like as there is no slackness of the last,
even so there is no swiftness of the first.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 43</span><a name="C5V43">&nbsp;</a>So I answered and said, Couldest thou not make those that have been made, and be now, and that are for
to come, at once; that thou mightest shew thy judgment the sooner?
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 44</span><a name="C5V44">&nbsp;</a>Then answered he me, and said, The creature may not haste above the maker; neither may the world hold
them at once that shall be created therein.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 45</span><a name="C5V45">&nbsp;</a>And I said, As thou hast said unto thy servant, that thou, which givest life to all, hast given life
at once to the creature that thou hast created, and the creature bare it: even so it might now also bear
them that now be present at once.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 46</span><a name="C5V46">&nbsp;</a>And he said unto me, Ask the womb of a woman, and say unto her, If thou bringest forth children, why
dost thou it not together, but one after another? pray her therefore to bring forth ten children at once.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 47</span><a name="C5V47">&nbsp;</a>And I said, She cannot: but must do it by distance of time.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 48</span><a name="C5V48">&nbsp;</a>Then said he unto me, Even so have I given the womb of the earth to those that be sown in it in their
times.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 49</span><a name="C5V49">&nbsp;</a>For like as a young child may not bring forth the things that belong to the aged, even so have I disposed
the world which I created.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 50</span><a name="C5V50">&nbsp;</a>And I asked, and said, Seeing thou hast now given me the way, I will proceed to speak before thee: for
our mother, of whom thou hast told me that she is young, draweth now nigh unto age.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 51</span><a name="C5V51">&nbsp;</a>He answered me, and said, Ask a woman that beareth children, and she shall tell thee.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 52</span><a name="C5V52">&nbsp;</a>Say unto her, Wherefore are unto they whom thou hast now brought forth like those that were before, but
less of stature?
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 53</span><a name="C5V53">&nbsp;</a>And she shall answer thee, They that be born in the the strength of youth are of one fashion, and they
that are born in the time of age, when the womb faileth, are otherwise.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 54</span><a name="C5V54">&nbsp;</a>Consider thou therefore also, how that ye are less of stature than those that were before you.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 55</span><a name="C5V55">&nbsp;</a>And so are they that come after you less than ye, as the creatures which now begin to be old, and have
passed over the strength of youth.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 56</span><a name="C5V56">&nbsp;</a>Then said I, Lord, I beseech thee, if I have found favour in thy sight, shew thy servant by whom thou
visitest thy creature.
