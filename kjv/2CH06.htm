 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C6V1">&nbsp;</a>Then said Solomon, The LORD hath said that he would dwell in the thick darkness.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C6V2">&nbsp;</a>But I have built an house of habitation for thee, and a place for thy dwelling for ever.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C6V3">&nbsp;</a>And the king turned his face, and blessed the whole congregation of Israel: and all the congregation
of Israel stood.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C6V4">&nbsp;</a>And he said, Blessed
<span class="add">be</span> the LORD God of Israel, who hath with his hands fulfilled
<span class="add">that</span> which he spake with his mouth to my father David, saying,
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C6V5">&nbsp;</a>Since the day that I brought forth my people out of the land of Egypt I chose no city among all the tribes
of Israel to build an house in, that my name might be there; neither chose I any man to be a ruler over
my people Israel:
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C6V6">&nbsp;</a>But I have chosen Jerusalem, that my name might be there; and have chosen David to be over my people
Israel.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C6V7">&nbsp;</a>Now it was in the heart of David my father to build an house for the name of the LORD God of Israel.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C6V8">&nbsp;</a>But the LORD said to David my father, Forasmuch as it was in thine heart to build an house for my name,
thou didst well in that it was in thine heart:
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C6V9">&nbsp;</a>Notwithstanding thou shalt not build the house; but thy son which shall come forth out of thy loins,
he shall build the house for my name.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C6V10">&nbsp;</a>The LORD therefore hath performed his word that he hath spoken: for I am risen up in the room of David
my father, and am set on the throne of Israel, as the LORD promised, and have built the house for the
name of the LORD God of Israel.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C6V11">&nbsp;</a>And in it have I put the ark, wherein
<span class="add">is</span> the covenant of the LORD, that he made with the children of Israel.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C6V12">&nbsp;</a>And he stood before the altar of the LORD in the presence of all the congregation of Israel, and spread
forth his hands:
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C6V13">&nbsp;</a>For Solomon had made a brasen scaffold, of five cubits long, and five cubits broad, and three cubits
high, and had set it in the midst of the court: and upon it he stood, and kneeled down upon his knees
before all the congregation of Israel, and spread forth his hands toward heaven,
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C6V14">&nbsp;</a>And said, O LORD God of Israel,
<span class="add">there is</span> no God like thee in the heaven, nor in the earth; which keepest covenant, and
<span class="add">shewest</span> mercy unto thy servants, that walk before thee with all their hearts:
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C6V15">&nbsp;</a>Thou which hast kept with thy servant David my father that which thou hast promised him; and spakest
with thy mouth, and hast fulfilled
<span class="add">it</span> with thine hand, as
<span class="add">it is</span> this day.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C6V16">&nbsp;</a>Now therefore, O LORD God of Israel, keep with thy servant David my father that which thou hast promised
him, saying, There shall not fail thee a man in my sight to sit upon the throne of Israel; yet so that
thy children take heed to their way to walk in my law, as thou hast walked before me.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C6V17">&nbsp;</a>Now then, O LORD God of Israel, let thy word be verified, which thou hast spoken unto thy servant David.
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C6V18">&nbsp;</a>But will God in very deed dwell with men on the earth? behold, heaven and the heaven of heavens cannot
contain thee; how much less this house which I have built!
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C6V19">&nbsp;</a>Have respect therefore to the prayer of thy servant, and to his supplication, O LORD my God, to hearken
unto the cry and the prayer which thy servant prayeth before thee:
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C6V20">&nbsp;</a>That thine eyes may be open upon this house day and night, upon the place whereof thou hast said that
thou wouldest put thy name there; to hearken unto the prayer which thy servant prayeth toward this place.
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C6V21">&nbsp;</a>Hearken therefore unto the supplications of thy servant, and of thy people Israel, which they shall make
toward this place: hear thou from thy dwelling place,
<span class="add">even</span> from heaven; and when thou hearest, forgive.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C6V22">&nbsp;</a>If a man sin against his neighbour, and an oath be laid upon him to make him swear, and the oath come
before thine altar in this house;
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C6V23">&nbsp;</a>Then hear thou from heaven, and do, and judge thy servants, by requiting the wicked, by recompensing
his way upon his own head; and by justifying the righteous, by giving him according to his righteousness.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C6V24">&nbsp;</a>And if thy people Israel be put to the worse before the enemy, because they have sinned against thee;
and shall return and confess thy name, and pray and make supplication before thee in this house;
 <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C6V25">&nbsp;</a>Then hear thou from the heavens, and forgive the sin of thy people Israel, and bring them again unto
the land which thou gavest to them and to their fathers.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C6V26">&nbsp;</a>When the heaven is shut up, and there is no rain, because they have sinned against thee;
<span class="add">yet</span> if they pray toward this place, and confess thy name, and turn from their sin, when thou dost afflict
them;
 <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C6V27">&nbsp;</a>Then hear thou from heaven, and forgive the sin of thy servants, and of thy people Israel, when thou
hast taught them the good way, wherein they should walk; and send rain upon thy land, which thou hast
given unto thy people for an inheritance.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C6V28">&nbsp;</a>If there be dearth in the land, if there be pestilence, if there be blasting, or mildew, locusts, or
caterpillers; if their enemies besiege them in the cities of their land; whatsoever sore or whatsoever
sickness
<span class="add">there be:
</span> <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C6V29">&nbsp;</a><span class="add">Then</span> what prayer
<span class="add">or</span> what supplication soever shall be made of any man, or of all thy people Israel, when every one shall
know his own sore and his own grief, and shall spread forth his hands in this house:
 <span class="verse"> 30</span><a name="C6V30">&nbsp;</a>Then hear thou from heaven thy dwelling place, and forgive, and render unto every man according unto
all his ways, whose heart thou knowest; (for thou only knowest the hearts of the children of men:)
 <span class="verse"> 31</span><a name="C6V31">&nbsp;</a>That they may fear thee, to walk in thy ways, so long as they live in the land which thou gavest unto
our fathers.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 32</span><a name="C6V32">&nbsp;</a>Moreover concerning the stranger, which is not of thy people Israel, but is come from a far country for
thy great name’s sake, and thy mighty hand, and thy stretched out arm; if they come and pray in this
house;
 <span class="verse"> 33</span><a name="C6V33">&nbsp;</a>Then hear thou from the heavens,
<span class="add">even</span> from thy dwelling place, and do according to all that the stranger calleth to thee for; that all people
of the earth may know thy name, and fear thee, as
<span class="add">doth</span> thy people Israel, and may know that this house which I have built is called by thy name.
 <span class="verse"> 34</span><a name="C6V34">&nbsp;</a>If thy people go out to war against their enemies by the way that thou shalt send them, and they pray
unto thee toward this city which thou hast chosen, and the house which I have built for thy name;
 <span class="verse"> 35</span><a name="C6V35">&nbsp;</a>Then hear thou from the heavens their prayer and their supplication, and maintain their cause.
 <span class="verse"> 36</span><a name="C6V36">&nbsp;</a>If they sin against thee, (for
<span class="add">there is</span> no man which sinneth not,) and thou be angry with them, and deliver them over before
<span class="add">their</span> enemies, and they carry them away captives unto a land far off or near;
 <span class="verse"> 37</span><a name="C6V37">&nbsp;</a>Yet
<span class="add">if</span> they bethink themselves in the land whither they are carried captive, and turn and pray unto thee in
the land of their captivity, saying, We have sinned, we have done amiss, and have dealt wickedly;
 <span class="verse"> 38</span><a name="C6V38">&nbsp;</a>If they return to thee with all their heart and with all their soul in the land of their captivity, whither
they have carried them captives, and pray toward their land, which thou gavest unto their fathers, and
<span class="add">toward</span> the city which thou hast chosen, and toward the house which I have built for thy name:
 <span class="verse"> 39</span><a name="C6V39">&nbsp;</a>Then hear thou from the heavens,
<span class="add">even</span> from thy dwelling place, their prayer and their supplications, and maintain their cause, and forgive
thy people which have sinned against thee.
 <span class="verse"> 40</span><a name="C6V40">&nbsp;</a>Now, my God, let, I beseech thee, thine eyes be open, and
<span class="add">let</span> thine ears
<span class="add">be</span> attent unto the prayer
<span class="add">that is made</span> in this place.
 <span class="verse"> 41</span><a name="C6V41">&nbsp;</a>Now therefore arise, O LORD God, into thy resting place, thou, and the ark of thy strength: let thy priests,
O LORD God, be clothed with salvation, and let thy saints rejoice in goodness.
 <span class="verse"> 42</span><a name="C6V42">&nbsp;</a>O LORD God, turn not away the face of thine anointed: remember the mercies of David thy servant.
