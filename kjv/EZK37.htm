<div class="chapterlabel"> 37</div><div class="p">
 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C37V1">&nbsp;</a>The hand of the LORD was upon me, and carried me out in the spirit of the LORD, and set me down in the
midst of the valley which
<span class="add">was</span> full of bones,
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C37V2">&nbsp;</a>And caused me to pass by them round about: and, behold,
<span class="add">there were
</span> very many in the open valley; and, lo,
<span class="add">they were</span> very dry.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C37V3">&nbsp;</a>And he said unto me, Son of man, can these bones live? And I answered, O Lord GOD, thou knowest.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C37V4">&nbsp;</a>Again he said unto me, Prophesy upon these bones, and say unto them, O ye dry bones, hear the word of
the LORD.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C37V5">&nbsp;</a>Thus saith the Lord GOD unto these bones; Behold, I will cause breath to enter into you, and ye shall
live:
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C37V6">&nbsp;</a>And I will lay sinews upon you, and will bring up flesh upon you, and cover you with skin, and put breath
in you, and ye shall live; and ye shall know that I
<span class="add">am</span> the LORD.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C37V7">&nbsp;</a>So I prophesied as I was commanded: and as I prophesied, there was a noise, and behold a shaking, and
the bones came together, bone to his bone.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C37V8">&nbsp;</a>And when I beheld, lo, the sinews and the flesh came up upon them, and the skin covered them above: but
<span class="add">there was
</span>no breath in them.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C37V9">&nbsp;</a>Then said he unto me, Prophesy unto the wind, prophesy, son of man, and say to the wind, Thus saith the
Lord GOD; Come from the four winds, O breath, and breathe upon these slain, that they may live.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C37V10">&nbsp;</a>So I prophesied as he commanded me, and the breath came into them, and they lived, and stood up upon
their feet, an exceeding great army.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C37V11">&nbsp;</a>Then he said unto me, Son of man, these bones are the whole house of Israel: behold, they say, Our bones
are dried, and our hope is lost: we are cut off for our parts.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C37V12">&nbsp;</a>Therefore prophesy and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, O my people, I will open your
graves, and cause you to come up out of your graves, and bring you into the land of Israel.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C37V13">&nbsp;</a>And ye shall know that I
<span class="add">am</span> the LORD, when I have opened your graves, O my people, and brought you up out of your graves,
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C37V14">&nbsp;</a>And shall put my spirit in you, and ye shall live, and I shall place you in your own land: then shall
ye know that I the LORD have spoken
<span class="add">it,
</span> and performed
<span class="add">it,</span> saith the LORD.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C37V15">&nbsp;</a>The word of the LORD came again unto me, saying,
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C37V16">&nbsp;</a>Moreover, thou son of man, take thee one stick, and write upon it, For Judah, and for the children of
Israel his companions: then take another stick, and write upon it, For Joseph, the stick of Ephraim,
and
<span class="add">for</span> all the house of Israel his companions:
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C37V17">&nbsp;</a>And join them one to another into one stick; and they shall become one in thine hand.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C37V18">&nbsp;</a>And when the children of thy people shall speak unto thee, saying, Wilt thou not shew us what thou
<span class="add">meanest</span> by these?
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C37V19">&nbsp;</a>Say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will take the stick of Joseph, which
<span class="add">is</span> in the hand of Ephraim, and the tribes of Israel his fellows, and will put them with him,
<span class="add">even</span> with the stick of Judah, and make them one stick, and they shall be one in mine hand.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C37V20">&nbsp;</a>And the sticks whereon thou writest shall be in thine hand before their eyes.
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C37V21">&nbsp;</a>And say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will take the children of Israel from among the
heathen, whither they be gone, and will gather them on every side, and bring them into their own land:
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C37V22">&nbsp;</a>And I will make them one nation in the land upon the mountains of Israel; and one king shall be king
to them all: and they shall be no more two nations, neither shall they be divided into two kingdoms any
more at all:
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C37V23">&nbsp;</a>Neither shall they defile themselves any more with their idols, nor with their detestable things, nor
with any of their transgressions: but I will save them out of all their dwellingplaces, wherein they
have sinned, and will cleanse them: so shall they be my people, and I will be their God.
 <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C37V24">&nbsp;</a>And David my servant
<span class="add">shall be</span> king over them; and they all shall have one shepherd: they shall also walk in my judgments, and observe
my statutes, and do them.
 <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C37V25">&nbsp;</a>And they shall dwell in the land that I have given unto Jacob my servant, wherein your fathers have dwelt;
and they shall dwell therein,
<span class="add">even</span> they, and their children, and their children’s children for ever: and my servant David
<span class="add">shall be</span> their prince for ever.
 <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C37V26">&nbsp;</a>Moreover I will make a covenant of peace with them; it shall be an everlasting covenant with them: and
I will place them, and multiply them, and will set my sanctuary in the midst of them for evermore.
 <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C37V27">&nbsp;</a>My tabernacle also shall be with them: yea, I will be their God, and they shall be my people.
 <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C37V28">&nbsp;</a>And the heathen shall know that I the LORD do sanctify Israel, when my sanctuary shall be in the midst
of them for evermore.
