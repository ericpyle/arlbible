 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C16V1">&nbsp;</a>Now concerning the collection for the saints, as I have given order to the churches of Galatia, even
so do ye.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C16V2">&nbsp;</a>Upon the first
<span class="add">day</span> of the week let every one of you lay by him in store, as
<span class="add">God</span> hath prospered him, that there be no gatherings when I come.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C16V3">&nbsp;</a>And when I come, whomsoever ye shall approve by
<span class="add">your</span> letters, them will I send to bring your liberality unto Jerusalem.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C16V4">&nbsp;</a>And if it be meet that I go also, they shall go with me.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C16V5">&nbsp;</a>Now I will come unto you, when I shall pass through Macedonia: for I do pass through Macedonia.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C16V6">&nbsp;</a>And it may be that I will abide, yea, and winter with you, that ye may bring me on my journey whithersoever
I go.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C16V7">&nbsp;</a>For I will not see you now by the way; but I trust to tarry a while with you, if the Lord permit.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C16V8">&nbsp;</a>But I will tarry at Ephesus until Pentecost.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C16V9">&nbsp;</a>For a great door and effectual is opened unto me, and
<span class="add">there are
</span> many adversaries.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C16V10">&nbsp;</a>Now if Timotheus come, see that he may be with you without fear: for he worketh the work of the Lord,
as I also
<span class="add">do.
</span> <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C16V11">&nbsp;</a>Let no man therefore despise him: but conduct him forth in peace, that he may come unto me: for I look
for him with the brethren.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C16V12">&nbsp;</a>As touching
<span class="add">our</span> brother Apollos, I greatly desired him to come unto you with the brethren: but his will was not at all
to come at this time; but he will come when he shall have convenient time.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C16V13">&nbsp;</a>Watch ye, stand fast in the faith, quit you like men, be strong.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C16V14">&nbsp;</a>Let all your things be done with charity.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C16V15">&nbsp;</a>I beseech you, brethren, (ye know the house of Stephanas, that it is the firstfruits of Achaia, and
<span class="add">that</span> they have addicted themselves to the ministry of the saints,)
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C16V16">&nbsp;</a>That ye submit yourselves unto such, and to every one that helpeth with
<span class="add">us,</span> and laboureth.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C16V17">&nbsp;</a>I am glad of the coming of Stephanas and Fortunatus and Achaicus: for that which was lacking on your
part they have supplied.
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C16V18">&nbsp;</a>For they have refreshed my spirit and yours: therefore acknowledge ye them that are such.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C16V19">&nbsp;</a>The churches of Asia salute you. Aquila and Priscilla salute you much in the Lord, with the church that
is in their house.
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C16V20">&nbsp;</a>All the brethren greet you. Greet ye one another with an holy kiss.
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C16V21">&nbsp;</a>The salutation of
<span class="add">me</span> Paul with mine own hand.
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C16V22">&nbsp;</a>If any man love not the Lord Jesus Christ, let him be Anathema Maranatha.
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C16V23">&nbsp;</a>The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ
<span class="add">be</span> with you.
 <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C16V24">&nbsp;</a>My love
<span class="add">be</span> with you all in Christ Jesus. Amen.
