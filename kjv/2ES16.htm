 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C16V1">&nbsp;</a>Woe be unto thee, Babylon, and Asia! woe be unto thee, Egypt and Syria!
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C16V2">&nbsp;</a>Gird up yourselves with cloths of sack and hair, bewail your children, and be sorry; for your destruction
is at hand.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C16V3">&nbsp;</a>A sword is sent upon you, and who may turn it back?
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C16V4">&nbsp;</a>A fire is sent among you, and who may quench it?
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C16V5">&nbsp;</a>Plagues are sent unto you, and what is he that may drive them away?
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C16V6">&nbsp;</a>May any man drive away an hungry lion in the wood? or may any one quench the fire in stubble, when it
hath begun to burn?
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C16V7">&nbsp;</a>May one turn again the arrow that is shot of a strong archer?
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C16V8">&nbsp;</a>The mighty Lord sendeth the plagues and who is he that can drive them away?
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C16V9">&nbsp;</a>A fire shall go forth from his wrath, and who is he that may quench it?
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C16V10">&nbsp;</a>He shall cast lightnings, and who shall not fear? he shall thunder, and who shall not be afraid?
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C16V11">&nbsp;</a>The Lord shall threaten, and who shall not be utterly beaten to powder at his presence?
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C16V12">&nbsp;</a>The earth quaketh, and the foundations thereof; the sea ariseth up with waves from the deep, and the
waves of it are troubled, and the fishes thereof also, before the Lord, and before the glory of his power:
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C16V13">&nbsp;</a>For strong is his right hand that bendeth the bow, his arrows that he shooteth are sharp, and shall not
miss, when they begin to be shot into the ends of the world.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C16V14">&nbsp;</a>Behold, the plagues are sent, and shall not return again, until they come upon the earth.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C16V15">&nbsp;</a>The fire is kindled, and shall not be put out, till it consume the foundation of the earth.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C16V16">&nbsp;</a>Like as an arrow which is shot of a mighty archer returneth not backward: even so the plagues that shall
be sent upon earth shall not return again.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C16V17">&nbsp;</a>Woe is me! woe is me! who will deliver me in those days?
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C16V18">&nbsp;</a>The beginning of sorrows and great mournings; the beginning of famine and great death; the beginning
of wars, and the powers shall stand in fear; the beginning of evils! what shall I do when these evils
shall come?
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C16V19">&nbsp;</a>Behold, famine and plague, tribulation and anguish, are sent as scourges for amendment.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C16V20">&nbsp;</a>But for all these things they shall not turn from their wickedness, nor be always mindful of the scourges.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C16V21">&nbsp;</a>Behold, victuals shall be so good cheap upon earth, that they shall think themselves to be in good case,
and even then shall evils grow upon earth, sword, famine, and great confusion.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C16V22">&nbsp;</a>For many of them that dwell upon earth shall perish of famine; and the other, that escape the hunger,
shall the sword destroy.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C16V23">&nbsp;</a>And the dead shall be cast out as dung, and there shall be no man to comfort them: for the earth shall
be wasted, and the cities shall be cast down.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C16V24">&nbsp;</a>There shall be no man left to till the earth, and to sow it
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C16V25">&nbsp;</a>The trees shall give fruit, and who shall gather them?
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C16V26">&nbsp;</a>The grapes shall ripen, and who shall tread them? for all places shall be desolate of men:
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C16V27">&nbsp;</a>So that one man shall desire to see another, and to hear his voice.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C16V28">&nbsp;</a>For of a city there shall be ten left, and two of the field, which shall hide themselves in the thick
groves, and in the clefts of the rocks.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C16V29">&nbsp;</a>As in an orchard of Olives upon every tree there are left three or four olives;
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 30</span><a name="C16V30">&nbsp;</a>Or as when a vineyard is gathered, there are left some clusters of them that diligently seek through
the vineyard:
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 31</span><a name="C16V31">&nbsp;</a>Even so in those days there shall be three or four left by them that search their houses with the sword.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 32</span><a name="C16V32">&nbsp;</a>And the earth shall be laid waste, and the fields thereof shall wax old, and her ways and all her paths
shall grow full of thorns, because no man shall travel therethrough.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 33</span><a name="C16V33">&nbsp;</a>The virgins shall mourn, having no bridegrooms; the women shall mourn, having no husbands; their daughters
shall mourn, having no helpers.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 34</span><a name="C16V34">&nbsp;</a>In the wars shall their bridegrooms be destroyed, and their husbands shall perish of famine.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 35</span><a name="C16V35">&nbsp;</a>Hear now these things and understand them, ye servants of the Lord.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 36</span><a name="C16V36">&nbsp;</a>Behold, the word of the Lord, receive it: believe not the gods of whom the Lord spake.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 37</span><a name="C16V37">&nbsp;</a>Behold, the plagues draw nigh, and are not slack.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 38</span><a name="C16V38">&nbsp;</a>As when a woman with child in the ninth month bringeth forth her son, with two or three hours of her
birth great pains compass her womb, which pains, when the child cometh forth, they slack not a moment:
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 39</span><a name="C16V39">&nbsp;</a>Even so shall not the plagues be slack to come upon the earth, and the world shall mourn, and sorrows
shall come upon it on every side.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 40</span><a name="C16V40">&nbsp;</a>O my people, hear my word: make you ready to thy battle, and in those evils be even as pilgrims upon
the earth.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 41</span><a name="C16V41">&nbsp;</a>He that selleth, let him be as he that fleeth away: and he that buyeth, as one that will lose:
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 42</span><a name="C16V42">&nbsp;</a>He that occupieth merchandise, as he that hath no profit by it: and he that buildeth, as he that shall
not dwell therein:
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 43</span><a name="C16V43">&nbsp;</a>He that soweth, as if he should not reap: so also he that planteth the vineyard, as he that shall not
gather the grapes:
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 44</span><a name="C16V44">&nbsp;</a>They that marry, as they that shall get no children; and they that marry not, as the widowers.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 45</span><a name="C16V45">&nbsp;</a>And therefore they that labour labour in vain:
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 46</span><a name="C16V46">&nbsp;</a>For strangers shall reap their fruits, and spoil their goods, overthrow their houses, and take their
children captives, for in captivity and famine shall they get children.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 47</span><a name="C16V47">&nbsp;</a>And they that occupy their merchandise with robbery, the more they deck their cities, their houses, their
possessions, and their own persons:
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 48</span><a name="C16V48">&nbsp;</a>The more will I be angry with them for their sin, saith the Lord.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 49</span><a name="C16V49">&nbsp;</a>Like as a whore envieth a right honest and virtuous woman:
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 50</span><a name="C16V50">&nbsp;</a>So shall righteousness hate iniquity, when she decketh herself, and shall accuse her to her face, when
he cometh that shall defend him that diligently searcheth out every sin upon earth.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 51</span><a name="C16V51">&nbsp;</a>And therefore be ye not like thereunto, nor to the works thereof.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 52</span><a name="C16V52">&nbsp;</a>For yet a little, and iniquity shall be taken away out of the earth, and righteousness shall reign among
you.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 53</span><a name="C16V53">&nbsp;</a>Let not the sinner say that he hath not sinned: for God shall burn coals of fire upon his head, which
saith before the Lord God and his glory, I have not sinned.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 54</span><a name="C16V54">&nbsp;</a>Behold, the Lord knoweth all the works of men, their imaginations, their thoughts, and their hearts:
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 55</span><a name="C16V55">&nbsp;</a>Which spake but the word, Let the earth be made; and it was made: Let the heaven be made; and it was
created.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 56</span><a name="C16V56">&nbsp;</a>In his word were the stars made, and he knoweth the number of them.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 57</span><a name="C16V57">&nbsp;</a>He searcheth the deep, and the treasures thereof; he hath measured the sea, and what it containeth.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 58</span><a name="C16V58">&nbsp;</a>He hath shut the sea in the midst of the waters, and with his word hath he hanged the earth upon the
waters.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 59</span><a name="C16V59">&nbsp;</a>He spreadeth out the heavens like a vault; upon the waters hath he founded it.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 60</span><a name="C16V60">&nbsp;</a>In the desert hath he made springs of water, and pools upon the tops of the mountains, that the floods
might pour down from the high rocks to water the earth.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 61</span><a name="C16V61">&nbsp;</a>He made man, and put his heart in the midst of the body, and gave him breath, life, and understanding.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 62</span><a name="C16V62">&nbsp;</a>Yea and the Spirit of Almighty God, which made all things, and searcheth out all hidden things in the
secrets of the earth,
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 63</span><a name="C16V63">&nbsp;</a>Surely he knoweth your inventions, and what ye think in your hearts, even them that sin, and would hide
their sin.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 64</span><a name="C16V64">&nbsp;</a>Therefore hath the Lord exactly searched out all your works, and he will put you all to shame.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 65</span><a name="C16V65">&nbsp;</a>And when your sins are brought forth, ye shall be ashamed before men, and your own sins shall be your
accusers in that day.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 66</span><a name="C16V66">&nbsp;</a>What will ye do? or how will ye hide your sins before God and his angels?
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 67</span><a name="C16V67">&nbsp;</a>Behold, God himself is the judge, fear him: leave off from your sins, and forget your iniquities, to
meddle no more with them for ever: so shall God lead you forth, and deliver you from all trouble.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 68</span><a name="C16V68">&nbsp;</a>For, behold, the burning wrath of a great multitude is kindled over you, and they shall take away certain
of you, and feed you, being idle, with things offered unto idols.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 69</span><a name="C16V69">&nbsp;</a>And they that consent unto them shall be had in derision and in reproach, and trodden under foot.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 70</span><a name="C16V70">&nbsp;</a>For there shall be in every place, and in the next cities, a great insurrection upon those that fear
the Lord.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 71</span><a name="C16V71">&nbsp;</a>They shall be like mad men, sparing none, but still spoiling and destroying those that fear the Lord.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 72</span><a name="C16V72">&nbsp;</a>For they shall waste and take away their goods, and cast them out of their houses.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 73</span><a name="C16V73">&nbsp;</a>Then shall they be known, who are my chosen; and they shall be tried as the gold in the fire.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 74</span><a name="C16V74">&nbsp;</a>Hear, O ye my beloved, saith the Lord: behold, the days of trouble are at hand, but I will deliver you
from the same.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 75</span><a name="C16V75">&nbsp;</a>Be ye not afraid neither doubt; for God is your guide,
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 76</span><a name="C16V76">&nbsp;</a>And the guide of them who keep my commandments and precepts, saith the Lord God: let not your sins weigh
you down, and let not your iniquities lift up themselves.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 77</span><a name="C16V77">&nbsp;</a>Woe be unto them that are bound with their sins, and covered with their iniquities like as a field is
covered over with bushes, and the path thereof covered with thorns, that no man may travel through!
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 78</span><a name="C16V78">&nbsp;</a>It is left undressed, and is cast into the fire to be consumed therewith.
