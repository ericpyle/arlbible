Canaan;
 <span class="verse"> 52</span><a name="C33V52">&nbsp;</a>Then ye shall drive out all the inhabitants of the land from before you, and destroy all their pictures,
and destroy all their molten images, and quite pluck down all their high places:
 <span class="verse"> 53</span><a name="C33V53">&nbsp;</a>And ye shall dispossess
<span class="add">the inhabitants</span> of the land, and dwell therein: for I have given you the land to possess it.
 <span class="verse"> 54</span><a name="C33V54">&nbsp;</a>And ye shall divide the land by lot for an inheritance among your families:
<span class="add">and</span> to the more ye shall give the more inheritance, and to the fewer ye shall give the less inheritance:
every man’s
<span class="add">inheritance</span> shall be in the place where his lot falleth; according to the tribes of your fathers ye shall inherit.
 <span class="verse"> 55</span><a name="C33V55">&nbsp;</a>But if ye will not drive out the inhabitants of the land from before you; then it shall come to pass,
that those which ye let remain of them
<span class="add">shall be</span> pricks in your eyes, and thorns in your sides, and shall vex you in the land wherein ye dwell.
 <span class="verse"> 56</span><a name="C33V56">&nbsp;</a>Moreover it shall come to pass,
<span class="add">that</span> I shall do unto you, as I thought to do unto them.
