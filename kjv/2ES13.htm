<div class="chapterlabel"> 13</div><div class="p">
 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C13V1">&nbsp;</a>And it came to pass after seven days, I dreamed a dream by night:
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C13V2">&nbsp;</a>And, lo, there arose a wind from the sea, that it moved all the waves thereof.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C13V3">&nbsp;</a>And I beheld, and, lo, that man waxed strong with the thousands of heaven: and when he turned his countenance
to look, all the things trembled that were seen under him.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C13V4">&nbsp;</a>And whensoever the voice went out of his mouth, all they burned that heard his voice, like as the earth
faileth when it feeleth the fire.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C13V5">&nbsp;</a>And after this I beheld, and, lo, there was gathered together a multitude of men, out of number, from
the four winds of the heaven, to subdue the man that came out of the sea
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C13V6">&nbsp;</a>But I beheld, and, lo, he had graved himself a great mountain, and flew up upon it.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C13V7">&nbsp;</a>But I would have seen the region or place whereout the hill was graven, and I could not.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C13V8">&nbsp;</a>And after this I beheld, and, lo, all they which were gathered together to subdue him were sore afraid,
and yet durst fight.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C13V9">&nbsp;</a>And, lo, as he saw the violence of the multitude that came, he neither lifted up his hand, nor held sword,
nor any instrument of war:
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C13V10">&nbsp;</a>But only I saw that he sent out of his mouth as it had been a blast of fire, and out of his lips a flaming
breath, and out of his tongue he cast out sparks and tempests.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C13V11">&nbsp;</a>And they were all mixed together; the blast of fire, the flaming breath, and the great tempest; and fell
with violence upon the multitude which was prepared to fight, and burned them up every one, so that upon
a sudden of an innumerable multitude nothing was to be perceived, but only dust and smell of smoke: when
I saw this I was afraid.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C13V12">&nbsp;</a>Afterward saw I the same man come down from the mountain, and call unto him another peaceable Multitude.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C13V13">&nbsp;</a>And there came much people unto him, whereof some were glad, some were sorry, and some of them were bound,
and other some brought of them that were offered: then was I sick through great fear, and I awaked, and
said,
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C13V14">&nbsp;</a>Thou hast shewed thy servant these wonders from the beginning, and hast counted me worthy that thou shouldest
receive my prayer:
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C13V15">&nbsp;</a>Shew me now yet the interpretation of this dream.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C13V16">&nbsp;</a>For as I conceive in mine understanding, woe unto them that shall be left in those days and much more
woe unto them that are not left behind!
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C13V17">&nbsp;</a>For they that were not left were in heaviness.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C13V18">&nbsp;</a>Now understand I the things that are laid up in the latter days, which shall happen unto them, and to
those that are left behind.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C13V19">&nbsp;</a>Therefore are they come into great perils and many necessities, like as these dreams declare.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C13V20">&nbsp;</a>Yet is it easier for him that is in danger to come into these things, than to pass away as a cloud out
of the world, and not to see the things that happen in the last days. And he answered unto me, and said,
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C13V21">&nbsp;</a>The interpretation of the vision shall I shew thee, and I will open unto thee the thing that thou hast
required.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C13V22">&nbsp;</a>Whereas thou hast spoken of them that are left behind, this is the interpretation:
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C13V23">&nbsp;</a>He that shall endure the peril in that time hath kept himself: they that be fallen into danger are such
as have works, and faith toward the Almighty.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C13V24">&nbsp;</a>Know this therefore, that they which be left behind are more blessed than they that be dead.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C13V25">&nbsp;</a>This is the meaning of the vision: Whereas thou sawest a man coming up from the midst of the sea:
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C13V26">&nbsp;</a>The same is he whom God the Highest hath kept a great season, which by his own self shall deliver his
creature: and he shall order them that are left behind.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C13V27">&nbsp;</a>And whereas thou sawest, that out of his mouth there came as a blast of wind, and fire, and storm;
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C13V28">&nbsp;</a>And that he held neither sword, nor any instrument of war, but that the rushing in of him destroyed the
whole multitude that came to subdue him; this is the interpretation:
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C13V29">&nbsp;</a>Behold, the days come, when the most High will begin to deliver them that are upon the earth.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 30</span><a name="C13V30">&nbsp;</a>And he shall come to the astonishment of them that dwell on the earth.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 31</span><a name="C13V31">&nbsp;</a>And one shall undertake to fight against another, one city against another, one place against another,
one people against another, and one realm against another.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 32</span><a name="C13V32">&nbsp;</a>And the time shall be when these things shall come to pass, and the signs shall happen which I shewed
thee before, and then shall my Son be declared, whom thou sawest as a man ascending.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 33</span><a name="C13V33">&nbsp;</a>And when all the people hear his voice, every man shall in their own land leave the battle they have
one against another.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 34</span><a name="C13V34">&nbsp;</a>And an innumerable multitude shall be gathered together, as thou sawest them, willing to come, and to
overcome him by fighting.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 35</span><a name="C13V35">&nbsp;</a>But he shall stand upon the top of the mount Sion.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 36</span><a name="C13V36">&nbsp;</a>And Sion shall come, and shall be shewed to all men, being prepared and builded, like as thou sawest
the hill graven without hands.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 37</span><a name="C13V37">&nbsp;</a>And this my Son shall rebuke the wicked inventions of those nations, which for their wicked life are
fallen into the tempest;
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 38</span><a name="C13V38">&nbsp;</a>And shall lay before them their evil thoughts, and the torments wherewith they shall begin to be tormented,
which are like unto a flame: and he shall destroy them without labour by the law which is like unto me.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 39</span><a name="C13V39">&nbsp;</a>And whereas thou sawest that he gathered another peaceable multitude unto him;
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 40</span><a name="C13V40">&nbsp;</a>Those are the ten tribes, which were carried away prisoners out of their own land in the time of Osea
the king, whom Salmanasar the king of Assyria led away captive, and he carried them over the waters,
and so came they into another land.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 41</span><a name="C13V41">&nbsp;</a>But they took this counsel among themselves, that they would leave the multitude of the heathen, and
go forth into a further country, where never mankind dwelt,
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 42</span><a name="C13V42">&nbsp;</a>That they might there keep their statutes, which they never kept in their own land.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 43</span><a name="C13V43">&nbsp;</a>And they entered into Euphrates by the narrow places of the river.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 44</span><a name="C13V44">&nbsp;</a>For the most High then shewed signs for them, and held still the flood, till they were passed over.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 45</span><a name="C13V45">&nbsp;</a>For through that country there was a great way to go, namely, of a year and a half: and the same region
is called Arsareth.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 46</span><a name="C13V46">&nbsp;</a>Then dwelt they there until the latter time; and now when they shall begin to come,
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 47</span><a name="C13V47">&nbsp;</a>The Highest shall stay the springs of the stream again, that they may go through: therefore sawest thou
the multitude with peace.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 48</span><a name="C13V48">&nbsp;</a>But those that be left behind of thy people are they that are found within my borders.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 49</span><a name="C13V49">&nbsp;</a>Now when he destroyeth the multitude of the nations that are gathered together, he shall defend his people
that remain.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 50</span><a name="C13V50">&nbsp;</a>And then shall he shew them great wonders.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 51</span><a name="C13V51">&nbsp;</a>Then said I, O Lord that bearest rule, shew me this: Wherefore have I seen the man coming up from the
midst of the sea?
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 52</span><a name="C13V52">&nbsp;</a>And he said unto me, Like as thou canst neither seek out nor know the things that are in the deep of
the sea: even so can no man upon earth see my Son, or those that be with him, but in the day time.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 53</span><a name="C13V53">&nbsp;</a>This is the interpretation of the dream which thou sawest, and whereby thou only art here lightened.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 54</span><a name="C13V54">&nbsp;</a>For thou hast forsaken thine own way, and applied thy diligence unto my law, and sought it.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 55</span><a name="C13V55">&nbsp;</a>Thy life hast thou ordered in wisdom, and hast called understanding thy mother.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 56</span><a name="C13V56">&nbsp;</a>And therefore have I shewed thee the treasures of the Highest: after other three days I will speak other
things unto thee, and declare unto thee mighty and wondrous things.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 57</span><a name="C13V57">&nbsp;</a>Then went I forth into the field, giving praise and thanks greatly unto the most High because of his
wonders which he did in time;
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 58</span><a name="C13V58">&nbsp;</a>And because he governeth the same, and such things as fall in their seasons: and there I sat three days.
