 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C49V1">&nbsp;</a>Concerning the Ammonites, thus saith the LORD; Hath Israel no sons? hath he no heir? why
<span class="add">then</span> doth their king inherit Gad, and his people dwell in his cities?
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C49V2">&nbsp;</a>Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will cause an alarm of war to be heard in Rabbah
of the Ammonites; and it shall be a desolate heap, and her daughters shall be burned with fire: then
shall Israel be heir unto them that were his heirs, saith the LORD.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C49V3">&nbsp;</a>Howl, O Heshbon, for Ai is spoiled: cry, ye daughters of Rabbah, gird you with sackcloth; lament, and
run to and fro by the hedges; for their king shall go into captivity,
<span class="add">and</span> his priests and his princes together.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C49V4">&nbsp;</a>Wherefore gloriest thou in the valleys, thy flowing valley, O backsliding daughter? that trusted in her
treasures,
<span class="add">saying,</span> Who shall come unto me?
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C49V5">&nbsp;</a>Behold, I will bring a fear upon thee, saith the Lord GOD of hosts, from all those that be about thee;
and ye shall be driven out every man right forth; and none shall gather up him that wandereth.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C49V6">&nbsp;</a>And afterward I will bring again the captivity of the children of Ammon, saith the LORD.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C49V7">&nbsp;</a>Concerning Edom, thus saith the LORD of hosts;
<span class="add">Is</span> wisdom no more in Teman? is counsel perished from the prudent? is their wisdom vanished?
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C49V8">&nbsp;</a>Flee ye, turn back, dwell deep, O inhabitants of Dedan; for I will bring the calamity of Esau upon him,
the time
<span class="add">that</span> I will visit him.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C49V9">&nbsp;</a>If grapegatherers come to thee, would they not leave
<span class="add">some
</span> gleaning grapes? if thieves by night, they will destroy till they have enough.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C49V10">&nbsp;</a>But I have made Esau bare, I have uncovered his secret places, and he shall not be able to hide himself:
his seed is spoiled, and his brethren, and his neighbours, and he is not.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C49V11">&nbsp;</a>Leave thy fatherless children, I will preserve
<span class="add">them</span> alive; and let thy widows trust in me.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C49V12">&nbsp;</a>For thus saith the LORD; Behold, they whose judgment
<span class="add">was
</span> not to drink of the cup have assuredly drunken; and
<span class="add">art</span> thou he
<span class="add">that</span> shall altogether go unpunished? thou shalt not go unpunished, but thou shalt surely drink
<span class="add">of it.
</span> <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C49V13">&nbsp;</a>For I have sworn by myself, saith the LORD, that Bozrah shall become a desolation, a reproach, a waste,
and a curse; and all the cities thereof shall be perpetual wastes.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C49V14">&nbsp;</a>I have heard a rumour from the LORD, and an ambassador is sent unto the heathen,
<span class="add">saying,</span> Gather ye together, and come against her, and rise up to the battle.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C49V15">&nbsp;</a>For, lo, I will make thee small among the heathen,
<span class="add">and</span> despised among men.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C49V16">&nbsp;</a>Thy terribleness hath deceived thee,
<span class="add">and</span> the pride of thine heart, O thou that dwellest in the clefts of the rock, that holdest the height of
the hill: though thou shouldest make thy nest as high as the eagle, I will bring thee down from thence,
saith the LORD.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C49V17">&nbsp;</a>Also Edom shall be a desolation: every one that goeth by it shall be astonished, and shall hiss at all
the plagues thereof.
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C49V18">&nbsp;</a>As in the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah and the neighbour
<span class="add">cities
</span> thereof, saith the LORD, no man shall abide there, neither shall a son of man dwell in it.
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C49V19">&nbsp;</a>Behold, he shall come up like a lion from the swelling of Jordan against the habitation of the strong:
but I will suddenly make him run away from her: and who
<span class="add">is</span> a chosen
<span class="add">man, that</span> I may appoint over her? for who
<span class="add">is</span> like me? and who will appoint me the time? and who
<span class="add">is</span> that shepherd that will stand before me?
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C49V20">&nbsp;</a>Therefore hear the counsel of the LORD, that he hath taken against Edom; and his purposes, that he hath
purposed against the inhabitants of Teman: Surely the least of the flock shall draw them out: surely
he shall make their habitations desolate with them.
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C49V21">&nbsp;</a>The earth is moved at the noise of their fall, at the cry the noise thereof was heard in the Red sea.
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C49V22">&nbsp;</a>Behold, he shall come up and fly as the eagle, and spread his wings over Bozrah: and at that day shall
the heart of the mighty men of Edom be as the heart of a woman in her pangs.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C49V23">&nbsp;</a>Concerning Damascus. Hamath is confounded, and Arpad: for they have heard evil tidings: they are fainthearted;
<span class="add">there is</span> sorrow on the sea; it cannot be quiet.
 <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C49V24">&nbsp;</a>Damascus is waxed feeble,
<span class="add">and</span> turneth herself to flee, and fear hath seized on
<span class="add">her:</span> anguish and sorrows have taken her, as a woman in travail.
 <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C49V25">&nbsp;</a>How is the city of praise not left, the city of my joy!
 <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C49V26">&nbsp;</a>Therefore her young men shall fall in her streets, and all the men of war shall be cut off in that day,
saith the LORD of hosts.
 <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C49V27">&nbsp;</a>And I will kindle a fire in the wall of Damascus, and it shall consume the palaces of Ben-hadad.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C49V28">&nbsp;</a>Concerning Kedar, and concerning the kingdoms of Hazor, which Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon shall smite,
thus saith the LORD; Arise ye, go up to Kedar, and spoil the men of the east.
 <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C49V29">&nbsp;</a>Their tents and their flocks shall they take away: they shall take to themselves their curtains, and
all their vessels, and their camels; and they shall cry unto them, Fear
<span class="add">is</span> on every side.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 30</span><a name="C49V30">&nbsp;</a>Flee, get you far off, dwell deep, O ye inhabitants of Hazor, saith the LORD; for Nebuchadrezzar king
of Babylon hath taken counsel against you, and hath conceived a purpose against you.
 <span class="verse"> 31</span><a name="C49V31">&nbsp;</a>Arise, get you up unto the wealthy nation, that dwelleth without care, saith the LORD, which have neither
gates nor bars,
<span class="add">which</span> dwell alone.
 <span class="verse"> 32</span><a name="C49V32">&nbsp;</a>And their camels shall be a booty, and the multitude of their cattle a spoil: and I will scatter into
all winds them
<span class="add">that are</span> in the utmost corners; and I will bring their calamity from all sides thereof, saith the LORD.
 <span class="verse"> 33</span><a name="C49V33">&nbsp;</a>And Hazor shall be a dwelling for dragons,
<span class="add">and</span> a desolation for ever: there shall no man abide there, nor
<span class="add">any</span> son of man dwell in it.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 34</span><a name="C49V34">&nbsp;</a>The word of the LORD that came to Jeremiah the prophet against Elam in the beginning of the reign of
Zedekiah king of Judah, saying,
 <span class="verse"> 35</span><a name="C49V35">&nbsp;</a>Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Behold, I will break the bow of Elam, the chief of their might.
 <span class="verse"> 36</span><a name="C49V36">&nbsp;</a>And upon Elam will I bring the four winds from the four quarters of heaven, and will scatter them toward
all those winds; and there shall be no nation whither the outcasts of Elam shall not come.
 <span class="verse"> 37</span><a name="C49V37">&nbsp;</a>For I will cause Elam to be dismayed before their enemies, and before them that seek their life: and
I will bring evil upon them
<span class="add">even
</span> my fierce anger, saith the LORD; and I will send the sword after them, till I have consumed them:
 <span class="verse"> 38</span><a name="C49V38">&nbsp;</a>And I will set my throne in Elam, and will destroy from thence the king and the princes, saith the LORD.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 39</span><a name="C49V39">&nbsp;</a>But it shall come to pass in the latter days,
<span class="add">that</span> I will bring again the captivity of Elam, saith the LORD.
