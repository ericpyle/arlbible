 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C30V1">&nbsp;</a>And Hezekiah sent to all Israel and Judah, and wrote letters also to Ephraim and Manasseh, that they
should come to the house of the LORD at Jerusalem, to keep the passover unto the LORD God of Israel.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C30V2">&nbsp;</a>For the king had taken counsel, and his princes, and all the congregation in Jerusalem, to keep the passover
in the second month.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C30V3">&nbsp;</a>For they could not keep it at that time, because the priests had not sanctified themselves sufficiently,
neither had the people gathered themselves together to Jerusalem.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C30V4">&nbsp;</a>And the thing pleased the king and all the congregation.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C30V5">&nbsp;</a>So they established a decree to make proclamation throughout all Israel, from Beer-sheba even to Dan,
that they should come to keep the passover unto the LORD God of Israel at Jerusalem: for they had not
done
<span class="add">it</span> of a long
<span class="add">time in such sort</span> as it was written.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C30V6">&nbsp;</a>So the posts went with the letters from the king and his princes throughout all Israel and Judah, and
according to the commandment of the king, saying, Ye children of Israel, turn again unto the LORD God
of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, and he will return to the remnant of you, that are escaped out of the
hand of the kings of Assyria.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C30V7">&nbsp;</a>And be not ye like your fathers, and like your brethren, which trespassed against the LORD God of their
fathers,
<span class="add">who</span> therefore gave them up to desolation, as ye see.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C30V8">&nbsp;</a>Now be ye not stiffnecked, as your fathers
<span class="add">were, but</span> yield yourselves unto the LORD, and enter into his sanctuary, which he hath sanctified for ever: and
serve the LORD your God, that the fierceness of his wrath may turn away from you.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C30V9">&nbsp;</a>For if ye turn again unto the LORD, your brethren and your children
<span class="add">shall find</span> compassion before them that lead them captive, so that they shall come again into this land: for the
LORD your God
<span class="add">is
</span> gracious and merciful, and will not turn away
<span class="add">his</span> face from you, if ye return unto him.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C30V10">&nbsp;</a>So the posts passed from city to city through the country of Ephraim and Manasseh even unto Zebulun:
but they laughed them to scorn, and mocked them.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C30V11">&nbsp;</a>Nevertheless divers of Asher and Manasseh and of Zebulun humbled themselves, and came to Jerusalem.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C30V12">&nbsp;</a>Also in Judah the hand of God was to give them one heart to do the commandment of the king and of the
princes, by the word of the LORD.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C30V13">&nbsp;</a>And there assembled at Jerusalem much people to keep the feast of unleavened bread in the second month,
a very great congregation.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C30V14">&nbsp;</a>And they arose and took away the altars that
<span class="add">were</span> in Jerusalem, and all the altars for incense took they away, and cast
<span class="add">them
</span> into the brook Kidron.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C30V15">&nbsp;</a>Then they killed the passover on the fourteenth
<span class="add">day</span> of the second month: and the priests and the Levites were ashamed, and sanctified themselves, and brought
in the burnt offerings into the house of the LORD.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C30V16">&nbsp;</a>And they stood in their place after their manner, according to the law of Moses the man of God: the priests
sprinkled the blood,
<span class="add">which they received</span> of the hand of the Levites.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C30V17">&nbsp;</a>For
<span class="add">there were</span> many in the congregation that were not sanctified: therefore the Levites had the charge of the killing
of the passovers for every one
<span class="add">that was</span> not clean, to sanctify
<span class="add">them
</span> unto the LORD.
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C30V18">&nbsp;</a>For a multitude of the people,
<span class="add">even</span> many of Ephraim, and Manasseh, Issachar, and Zebulun, had not cleansed themselves, yet did they eat
the passover otherwise than it was written. But Hezekiah prayed for them, saying, The good LORD pardon
every one
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C30V19">&nbsp;</a><span class="add">That</span> prepareth his heart to seek God, the LORD God of his fathers, though
<span class="add">he be</span> not
<span class="add">cleansed</span> according to the purification of the sanctuary.
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C30V20">&nbsp;</a>And the LORD hearkened to Hezekiah, and healed the people.
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C30V21">&nbsp;</a>And the children of Israel that were present at Jerusalem kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days
with great gladness: and the Levites and the priests praised the LORD day by day,
<span class="add">singing</span> with loud instruments unto the LORD.
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C30V22">&nbsp;</a>And Hezekiah spake comfortably unto all the Levites that taught the good knowledge of the LORD: and they
did eat throughout the feast seven days, offering peace offerings, and making confession to the LORD
God of their fathers.
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C30V23">&nbsp;</a>And the whole assembly took counsel to keep other seven days: and they kept
<span class="add">other</span> seven days with gladness.
 <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C30V24">&nbsp;</a>For Hezekiah king of Judah did give to the congregation a thousand bullocks and seven thousand sheep;
and the princes gave to the congregation a thousand bullocks and ten thousand sheep: and a great number
of priests sanctified themselves.
 <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C30V25">&nbsp;</a>And all the congregation of Judah, with the priests and the Levites, and all the congregation that came
out of Israel, and the strangers that came out of the land of Israel, and that dwelt in Judah, rejoiced.
 <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C30V26">&nbsp;</a>So there was great joy in Jerusalem: for since the time of Solomon the son of David king of Israel
<span class="add">there was</span> not the like in Jerusalem.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C30V27">&nbsp;</a>Then the priests the Levites arose and blessed the people: and their voice was heard, and their prayer
came
<span class="add">up</span> to his holy dwelling place,
<span class="add">even</span> unto heaven.
