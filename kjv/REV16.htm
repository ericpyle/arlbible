 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C16V1">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And I heard a great voice out of the temple saying to the seven angels, Go your ways, and pour out the
vials of the wrath of God upon the earth.
</span> <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C16V2">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And the first went, and poured out his vial upon the earth; and there fell a noisome and grievous sore
upon the men which had the mark of the beast, and
</span><span class="add">upon</span><span class="wj"> them which worshipped his image.
</span> <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C16V3">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And the second angel poured out his vial upon the sea; and it became as the blood of a dead
</span><span class="add">man:</span><span class="wj"> and every living soul died in the sea.
</span> <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C16V4">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And the third angel poured out his vial upon the rivers and fountains of waters; and they became blood.
</span> <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C16V5">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And I heard the angel of the waters say, Thou art righteous, O Lord, which art, and wast, and shalt be,
because thou hast judged thus.
</span> <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C16V6">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">For they have shed the blood of saints and prophets, and thou hast given them blood to drink; for they
are worthy.
</span> <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C16V7">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And I heard another out of the altar say, Even so, Lord God Almighty, true and righteous
</span><span class="add">are</span><span class="wj"> thy judgments.
</span> <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C16V8">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And the fourth angel poured out his vial upon the sun; and power was given unto him to scorch men with
fire.
</span> <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C16V9">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And men were scorched with great heat, and blasphemed the name of God, which hath power over these plagues:
and they repented not to give him glory.
</span> <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C16V10">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And the fifth angel poured out his vial upon the seat of the beast; and his kingdom was full of darkness;
and they gnawed their tongues for pain,
</span> <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C16V11">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And blasphemed the God of heaven because of their pains and their sores, and repented not of their deeds.
</span> <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C16V12">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And the sixth angel poured out his vial upon the great river Euphrates; and the water thereof was dried
up, that the way of the kings of the east might be prepared.
</span> <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C16V13">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And I saw three unclean spirits like frogs
</span><span class="add">come</span><span class="wj"> out of the mouth of the dragon, and out of the mouth of the beast, and out of the mouth of the false
prophet.
</span> <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C16V14">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">For they are the spirits of devils, working miracles,
</span><span class="add">which
</span><span class="wj"> go forth unto the kings of the earth and of the whole world, to gather them to the battle of that great
day of God Almighty.
</span> <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C16V15">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Behold, I come as a thief. Blessed
</span><span class="add">is</span><span class="wj"> he that watcheth, and keepeth his garments, lest he walk naked, and they see his shame.
</span> <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C16V16">&nbsp;</a>And he gathered them together into a place called in the Hebrew tongue Armageddon.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C16V17">&nbsp;</a>And the seventh angel poured out his vial into the air; and there came a great voice out of the temple
of heaven, from the throne, saying, It is done.
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C16V18">&nbsp;</a>And there were voices, and thunders, and lightnings; and there was a great earthquake, such as was not
since men were upon the earth, so mighty an earthquake,
<span class="add">and</span> so great.
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C16V19">&nbsp;</a>And the great city was divided into three parts, and the cities of the nations fell: and great Babylon
came in remembrance before God, to give unto her the cup of the wine of the fierceness of his wrath.
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C16V20">&nbsp;</a>And every island fled away, and the mountains were not found.
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C16V21">&nbsp;</a>And there fell upon men a great hail out of heaven,
<span class="add">every stone
</span> about the weight of a talent: and men blasphemed God because of the plague of the hail; for the plague
thereof was exceeding great.
