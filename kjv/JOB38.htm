 <span class="verse" id="V1">1&nbsp;</span>Then the LORD answered Job out of the whirlwind, and said,  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span>Who <span class='add'>is</span> this that darkeneth counsel by words without knowledge?  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>Gird up now thy loins like a man; for I will demand of thee, and answer thou me.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>Where wast thou when I laid the foundations of the earth? declare, if thou hast understanding.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>Who hath laid the measures thereof, if thou knowest? or who hath stretched the line upon it?  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>Whereupon are the foundations thereof fastened? or who laid the corner stone thereof;  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>When the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy?  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>Or <span class='add'>who</span> shut up the sea with doors, when it brake forth, <span class='add'>as if</span> it had issued out of the womb?  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>When I made the cloud the garment thereof, and thick darkness a swaddlingband for it,  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>And brake up for it my decreed <span class='add'>place</span>, and set bars and doors,  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>And said, Hitherto shalt thou come, but no further: and here shall thy proud waves be stayed?  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>Hast thou commanded the morning since thy days; <span class='add'>and</span> caused the dayspring to know his place;  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>That it might take hold of the ends of the earth, that the wicked might be shaken out of it?  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>It is turned as clay <span class='add'>to</span> the seal; and they stand as a garment.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>And from the wicked their light is withholden, and the high arm shall be broken.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>Hast thou entered into the springs of the sea? or hast thou walked in the search of the depth?  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>Have the gates of death been opened unto thee? or hast thou seen the doors of the shadow of death?  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>Hast thou perceived the breadth of the earth? declare if thou knowest it all.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>Where <span class='add'>is</span> the way <span class='add'>where</span> light dwelleth? and <span class='add'>as for</span> darkness, where <span class='add'>is</span> the place thereof,  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>That thou shouldest take it to the bound thereof, and that thou shouldest know the paths <span class='add'>to</span> the house thereof?  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>Knowest thou <span class='add'>it</span>, because thou wast then born? or <span class='add'>because</span> the number of thy days <span class='add'>is</span> great?  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>Hast thou entered into the treasures of the snow? or hast thou seen the treasures of the hail,  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>Which I have reserved against the time of trouble, against the day of battle and war?  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>By what way is the light parted, <span class='add'>which</span> scattereth the east wind upon the earth?  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>Who hath divided a watercourse for the overflowing of waters, or a way for the lightning of thunder;  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>To cause it to rain on the earth, <span class='add'>where</span> no man <span class='add'>is; on</span> the wilderness, wherein <span class='add'>there is</span> no man;  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>To satisfy the desolate and waste <span class='add'>ground;</span> and to cause the bud of the tender herb to spring forth?  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&nbsp;</span>Hath the rain a father? or who hath begotten the drops of dew?  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&nbsp;</span>Out of whose womb came the ice? and the hoary frost of heaven, who hath gendered it?  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&nbsp;</span>The waters are hid as <span class='add'>with</span> a stone, and the face of the deep is frozen.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&nbsp;</span>Canst thou bind the sweet influences of Pleiades, or loose the bands of Orion?  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&nbsp;</span>Canst thou bring forth Mazzaroth in his season? or canst thou guide Arcturus with his sons?  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&nbsp;</span>Knowest thou the ordinances of heaven? canst thou set the dominion thereof in the earth?  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&nbsp;</span>Canst thou lift up thy voice to the clouds, that abundance of waters may cover thee?  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&nbsp;</span>Canst thou send lightnings, that they may go, and say unto thee, Here we <span class='add'>are?</span>  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&nbsp;</span>Who hath put wisdom in the inward parts? or who hath given understanding to the heart?  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&nbsp;</span>Who can number the clouds in wisdom? or who can stay the bottles of heaven,  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&nbsp;</span>When the dust groweth into hardness, and the clods cleave fast together?  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&nbsp;</span>Wilt thou hunt the prey for the lion? or fill the appetite of the young lions,  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&nbsp;</span>When they couch in <span class='add'>their</span> dens, <span class='add'>and</span> abide in the covert to lie in wait?  <span class="verse" id="V41">41&nbsp;</span>Who provideth for the raven his food? when his young ones cry unto God, they wander for lack of meat. </div><ul class='tnav'>
