 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C6V1">&nbsp;</a>Now these
<span class="add">are</span> the commandments, the statutes, and the judgments, which the LORD your God commanded to teach you, that
ye might do
<span class="add">them</span> in the land whither ye go to possess it:
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C6V2">&nbsp;</a>That thou mightest fear the LORD thy God, to keep all his statutes and his commandments, which I command
thee, thou, and thy son, and thy son’s son, all the days of thy life; and that thy days may be prolonged.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C6V3">&nbsp;</a>Hear therefore, O Israel, and observe to do
<span class="add">it;</span> that it may be well with thee, and that ye may increase mightily, as the LORD God of thy fathers hath
promised thee, in the land that floweth with milk and honey.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C6V4">&nbsp;</a>Hear, O Israel: The LORD our God
<span class="add">is</span> one LORD:
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C6V5">&nbsp;</a>And thou shalt love the LORD thy God with all thine heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy might.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C6V6">&nbsp;</a>And these words, which I command thee this day, shall be in thine heart:
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C6V7">&nbsp;</a>And thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children, and shalt talk of them when thou sittest in thine
house, and when thou walkest by the way, and when thou liest down, and when thou risest up.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C6V8">&nbsp;</a>And thou shalt bind them for a sign upon thine hand, and they shall be as frontlets between thine eyes.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C6V9">&nbsp;</a>And thou shalt write them upon the posts of thy house, and on thy gates.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C6V10">&nbsp;</a>And it shall be, when the LORD thy God shall have brought thee into the land which he sware unto thy
fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give thee great and goodly cities, which thou buildedst
not,
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C6V11">&nbsp;</a>And houses full of all good
<span class="add">things,</span> which thou filledst not, and wells digged, which thou diggedst not, vineyards and olive trees, which
thou plantedst not; when thou shalt have eaten and be full;
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C6V12">&nbsp;</a><span class="add">Then</span> beware lest thou forget the LORD, which brought thee forth out of the land of Egypt, from the house
of bondage.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C6V13">&nbsp;</a>Thou shalt fear the LORD thy God, and serve him, and shalt swear by his name.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C6V14">&nbsp;</a>Ye shall not go after other gods, of the gods of the people which
<span class="add">are</span> round about you;
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C6V15">&nbsp;</a>(For the LORD thy God
<span class="add">is</span> a jealous God among you) lest the anger of the LORD thy God be kindled against thee, and destroy thee
from off the face of the earth.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C6V16">&nbsp;</a>Ye shall not tempt the LORD your God, as ye tempted
<span class="add">him</span> in Massah.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C6V17">&nbsp;</a>Ye shall diligently keep the commandments of the LORD your God, and his testimonies, and his statutes,
which he hath commanded thee.
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C6V18">&nbsp;</a>And thou shalt do
<span class="add">that which is</span> right and good in the sight of the LORD: that it may be well with thee, and that thou mayest go in and
possess the good land which the LORD sware unto thy fathers,
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C6V19">&nbsp;</a>To cast out all thine enemies from before thee, as the LORD hath spoken.
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C6V20">&nbsp;</a><span class="add">And</span> when thy son asketh thee in time to come, saying, What
<span class="add">mean</span> the testimonies, and the statutes, and the judgments, which the LORD our God hath commanded you?
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C6V21">&nbsp;</a>Then thou shalt say unto thy son, We were Pharaoh’s bondmen in Egypt; and the LORD brought us out of
Egypt with a mighty hand:
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C6V22">&nbsp;</a>And the LORD shewed signs and wonders, great and sore, upon Egypt, upon Pharaoh, and upon all his household,
before our eyes:
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C6V23">&nbsp;</a>And he brought us out from thence, that he might bring us in, to give us the land which he sware unto
our fathers.
 <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C6V24">&nbsp;</a>And the LORD commanded us to do all these statutes, to fear the LORD our God, for our good always, that
he might preserve us alive, as
<span class="add">it is
</span> at this day.
 <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C6V25">&nbsp;</a>And it shall be our righteousness, if we observe to do all these commandments before the LORD our God,
as he hath commanded us.
