 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C2V1">&nbsp;</a>Thou therefore, my son, be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C2V2">&nbsp;</a>And the things that thou hast heard of me among many witnesses, the same commit thou to faithful men,
who shall be able to teach others also.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C2V3">&nbsp;</a>Thou therefore endure hardness, as a good soldier of Jesus Christ.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C2V4">&nbsp;</a>No man that warreth entangleth himself with the affairs of
<span class="add">this
</span> life; that he may please him who hath chosen him to be a soldier.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C2V5">&nbsp;</a>And if a man also strive for masteries,
<span class="add">yet</span> is he not crowned, except he strive lawfully.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C2V6">&nbsp;</a>The husbandman that laboureth must be first partaker of the fruits.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C2V7">&nbsp;</a>Consider what I say; and the Lord give thee understanding in all things.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C2V8">&nbsp;</a>Remember that Jesus Christ of the seed of David was raised from the dead according to my gospel:
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C2V9">&nbsp;</a>Wherein I suffer trouble, as an evil doer,
<span class="add">even</span> unto bonds; but the word of God is not bound.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C2V10">&nbsp;</a>Therefore I endure all things for the elect’s sakes, that they may also obtain the salvation which is
in Christ Jesus with eternal glory.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C2V11">&nbsp;</a><span class="add">It is</span> a faithful saying: For if we be dead with
<span class="add">him,
</span> we shall also live with
<span class="add">him:
</span> <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C2V12">&nbsp;</a>If we suffer, we shall also reign with
<span class="add">him:</span> if we deny
<span class="add">him,</span> he also will deny us:
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C2V13">&nbsp;</a>If we believe not,
<span class="add">yet</span> he abideth faithful: he cannot deny himself.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C2V14">&nbsp;</a>Of these things put
<span class="add">them</span> in remembrance, charging
<span class="add">them
</span> before the Lord that they strive not about words to no profit,
<span class="add">but</span> to the subverting of the hearers.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C2V15">&nbsp;</a>Study to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the
word of truth.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C2V16">&nbsp;</a>But shun profane
<span class="add">and</span> vain babblings: for they will increase unto more ungodliness.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C2V17">&nbsp;</a>And their word will eat as doth a canker: of whom is Hymenaeus and Philetus;
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C2V18">&nbsp;</a>Who concerning the truth have erred, saying that the resurrection is past already; and overthrow the
faith of some.
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C2V19">&nbsp;</a>Nevertheless the foundation of God standeth sure, having this seal, The Lord knoweth them that are his.
And, Let every one that nameth the name of Christ depart from iniquity.
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C2V20">&nbsp;</a>But in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver, but also of wood and of earth;
and some to honour, and some to dishonour.
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C2V21">&nbsp;</a>If a man therefore purge himself from these, he shall be a vessel unto honour, sanctified, and meet for
the master’s use,
<span class="add">and</span> prepared unto every good work.
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C2V22">&nbsp;</a>Flee also youthful lusts: but follow righteousness, faith, charity, peace, with them that call on the
Lord out of a pure heart.
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C2V23">&nbsp;</a>But foolish and unlearned questions avoid, knowing that they do gender strifes.
 <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C2V24">&nbsp;</a>And the servant of the Lord must not strive; but be gentle unto all
<span class="add">men,</span> apt to teach, patient,
 <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C2V25">&nbsp;</a>In meekness instructing those that oppose themselves; if God peradventure will give them repentance to
the acknowledging of the truth;
 <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C2V26">&nbsp;</a>And
<span class="add">that</span> they may recover themselves out of the snare of the devil, who are taken captive by him at his will.
