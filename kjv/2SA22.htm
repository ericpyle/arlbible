 <span class="verse" id="V1">1&nbsp;</span>And David spake unto the LORD the words of this song in the day <span class='add'>that</span> the LORD had delivered him out of the hand of all his enemies, and out of the hand of Saul:  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span>And he said, The LORD <span class='add'>is</span> my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer;  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>The God of my rock; in him will I trust: <span class='add'>he is</span> my shield, and the horn of my salvation, my high tower, and my refuge, my saviour; thou savest me from violence.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>I will call on the LORD, <span class='add'>who is</span> worthy to be praised: so shall I be saved from mine enemies.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>When the waves of death compassed me, the floods of ungodly men made me afraid;  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>The sorrows of hell compassed me about; the snares of death prevented me;  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>In my distress I called upon the LORD, and cried to my God: and he did hear my voice out of his temple, and my cry <span class='add'>did enter</span> into his ears.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>Then the earth shook and trembled; the foundations of heaven moved and shook, because he was wroth.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>There went up a smoke out of his nostrils, and fire out of his mouth devoured: coals were kindled by it.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>He bowed the heavens also, and came down; and darkness <span class='add'>was</span> under his feet.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>And he rode upon a cherub, and did fly: and he was seen upon the wings of the wind.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>And he made darkness pavilions round about him, dark waters, <span class='add'>and</span> thick clouds of the skies.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>Through the brightness before him were coals of fire kindled.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>The LORD thundered from heaven, and the most High uttered his voice.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>And he sent out arrows, and scattered them; lightning, and discomfited them.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>And the channels of the sea appeared, the foundations of the world were discovered, at the rebuking of the LORD, at the blast of the breath of his nostrils.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>He sent from above, he took me; he drew me out of many waters;  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>He delivered me from my strong enemy, <span class='add'>and</span> from them that hated me: for they were too strong for me.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>They prevented me in the day of my calamity: but the LORD was my stay.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>He brought me forth also into a large place: he delivered me, because he delighted in me.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>The LORD rewarded me according to my righteousness: according to the cleanness of my hands hath he recompensed me.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>For I have kept the ways of the LORD, and have not wickedly departed from my God.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>For all his judgments <span class='add'>were</span> before me: and <span class='add'>as for</span> his statutes, I did not depart from them.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>I was also upright before him, and have kept myself from mine iniquity.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>Therefore the LORD hath recompensed me according to my righteousness; according to my cleanness in his eye sight.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>With the merciful thou wilt shew thyself merciful, <span class='add'>and</span> with the upright man thou wilt shew thyself upright.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>With the pure thou wilt shew thyself pure; and with the froward thou wilt shew thyself unsavoury.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&nbsp;</span>And the afflicted people thou wilt save: but thine eyes <span class='add'>are</span> upon the haughty, <span class='add'>that</span> thou mayest bring <span class='add'>them</span> down.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&nbsp;</span>For thou <span class='add'>art</span> my lamp, O LORD: and the LORD will lighten my darkness.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&nbsp;</span>For by thee I have run through a troop: by my God have I leaped over a wall.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&nbsp;</span> <span class='add'>As for</span> God, his way <span class='add'>is</span> perfect; the word of the LORD <span class='add'>is</span> tried: he <span class='add'>is</span> a buckler to all them that trust in him.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&nbsp;</span>For who <span class='add'>is</span> God, save the LORD? and who <span class='add'>is</span> a rock, save our God?  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&nbsp;</span>God <span class='add'>is</span> my strength <span class='add'>and</span> power: and he maketh my way perfect.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&nbsp;</span>He maketh my feet like hinds <span class='add'>feet:</span> and setteth me upon my high places.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&nbsp;</span>He teacheth my hands to war; so that a bow of steel is broken by mine arms.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&nbsp;</span>Thou hast also given me the shield of thy salvation: and thy gentleness hath made me great.  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&nbsp;</span>Thou hast enlarged my steps under me; so that my feet did not slip.  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&nbsp;</span>I have pursued mine enemies, and destroyed them; and turned not again until I had consumed them.  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&nbsp;</span>And I have consumed them, and wounded them, that they could not arise: yea, they are fallen under my feet.  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&nbsp;</span>For thou hast girded me with strength to battle: them that rose up against me hast thou subdued under me.  <span class="verse" id="V41">41&nbsp;</span>Thou hast also given me the necks of mine enemies, that I might destroy them that hate me.  <span class="verse" id="V42">42&nbsp;</span>They looked, but <span class='add'>there was</span> none to save; <span class='add'>even</span> unto the LORD, but he answered them not.  <span class="verse" id="V43">43&nbsp;</span>Then did I beat them as small as the dust of the earth, I did stamp them as the mire of the street, <span class='add'>and</span> did spread them abroad.  <span class="verse" id="V44">44&nbsp;</span>Thou also hast delivered me from the strivings of my people, thou hast kept me <span class='add'>to be</span> head of the heathen: a people <span class='add'>which</span> I knew not shall serve me.  <span class="verse" id="V45">45&nbsp;</span>Strangers shall submit themselves unto me: as soon as they hear, they shall be obedient unto me.  <span class="verse" id="V46">46&nbsp;</span>Strangers shall fade away, and they shall be afraid out of their close places.  <span class="verse" id="V47">47&nbsp;</span>The LORD liveth; and blessed <span class='add'>be</span> my rock; and exalted be the God of the rock of my salvation.  <span class="verse" id="V48">48&nbsp;</span>It <span class='add'>is</span> God that avengeth me, and that bringeth down the people under me,  <span class="verse" id="V49">49&nbsp;</span>And that bringeth me forth from mine enemies: thou also hast lifted me up on high above them that rose up against me: thou hast delivered me from the violent man.  <span class="verse" id="V50">50&nbsp;</span>Therefore I will give thanks unto thee, O LORD, among the heathen, and I will sing praises unto thy name.  <span class="verse" id="V51">51&nbsp;</span> <span class='add'>He is</span> the tower of salvation for his king: and sheweth mercy to his anointed, unto David, and to his seed for evermore. </div><ul class='tnav'>
