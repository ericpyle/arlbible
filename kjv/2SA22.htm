 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C22V1">&nbsp;</a>And David spake unto the LORD the words of this song in the day
<span class="add">that</span> the LORD had delivered him out of the hand of all his enemies, and out of the hand of Saul:
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C22V2">&nbsp;</a>And he said, The LORD
<span class="add">is</span> my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer;
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C22V3">&nbsp;</a>The God of my rock; in him will I trust:
<span class="add">he is</span> my shield, and the horn of my salvation, my high tower, and my refuge, my saviour; thou savest me from
violence.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C22V4">&nbsp;</a>I will call on the LORD,
<span class="add">who is</span> worthy to be praised: so shall I be saved from mine enemies.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C22V5">&nbsp;</a>When the waves of death compassed me, the floods of ungodly men made me afraid;
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C22V6">&nbsp;</a>The sorrows of hell compassed me about; the snares of death prevented me;
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C22V7">&nbsp;</a>In my distress I called upon the LORD, and cried to my God: and he did hear my voice out of his temple,
and my cry
<span class="add">did enter</span> into his ears.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C22V8">&nbsp;</a>Then the earth shook and trembled; the foundations of heaven moved and shook, because he was wroth.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C22V9">&nbsp;</a>There went up a smoke out of his nostrils, and fire out of his mouth devoured: coals were kindled by
it.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C22V10">&nbsp;</a>He bowed the heavens also, and came down; and darkness
<span class="add">was
</span> under his feet.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C22V11">&nbsp;</a>And he rode upon a cherub, and did fly: and he was seen upon the wings of the wind.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C22V12">&nbsp;</a>And he made darkness pavilions round about him, dark waters,
<span class="add">and
</span> thick clouds of the skies.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C22V13">&nbsp;</a>Through the brightness before him were coals of fire kindled.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C22V14">&nbsp;</a>The LORD thundered from heaven, and the most High uttered his voice.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C22V15">&nbsp;</a>And he sent out arrows, and scattered them; lightning, and discomfited them.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C22V16">&nbsp;</a>And the channels of the sea appeared, the foundations of the world were discovered, at the rebuking of
the LORD, at the blast of the breath of his nostrils.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C22V17">&nbsp;</a>He sent from above, he took me; he drew me out of many waters;
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C22V18">&nbsp;</a>He delivered me from my strong enemy,
<span class="add">and</span> from them that hated me: for they were too strong for me.
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C22V19">&nbsp;</a>They prevented me in the day of my calamity: but the LORD was my stay.
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C22V20">&nbsp;</a>He brought me forth also into a large place: he delivered me, because he delighted in me.
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C22V21">&nbsp;</a>The LORD rewarded me according to my righteousness: according to the cleanness of my hands hath he recompensed
me.
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C22V22">&nbsp;</a>For I have kept the ways of the LORD, and have not wickedly departed from my God.
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C22V23">&nbsp;</a>For all his judgments
<span class="add">were</span> before me: and
<span class="add">as for
</span> his statutes, I did not depart from them.
 <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C22V24">&nbsp;</a>I was also upright before him, and have kept myself from mine iniquity.
 <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C22V25">&nbsp;</a>Therefore the LORD hath recompensed me according to my righteousness; according to my cleanness in his
eye sight.
 <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C22V26">&nbsp;</a>With the merciful thou wilt shew thyself merciful,
<span class="add">and</span> with the upright man thou wilt shew thyself upright.
 <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C22V27">&nbsp;</a>With the pure thou wilt shew thyself pure; and with the froward thou wilt shew thyself unsavoury.
 <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C22V28">&nbsp;</a>And the afflicted people thou wilt save: but thine eyes
<span class="add">are
</span> upon the haughty,
<span class="add">that</span> thou mayest bring
<span class="add">them</span> down.
 <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C22V29">&nbsp;</a>For thou
<span class="add">art</span> my lamp, O LORD: and the LORD will lighten my darkness.
 <span class="verse"> 30</span><a name="C22V30">&nbsp;</a>For by thee I have run through a troop: by my God have I leaped over a wall.
 <span class="verse"> 31</span><a name="C22V31">&nbsp;</a><span class="add">As for</span> God, his way
<span class="add">is</span> perfect; the word of the LORD
<span class="add">is</span> tried: he
<span class="add">is</span> a buckler to all them that trust in him.
 <span class="verse"> 32</span><a name="C22V32">&nbsp;</a>For who
<span class="add">is</span> God, save the LORD? and who
<span class="add">is</span> a rock, save our God?
 <span class="verse"> 33</span><a name="C22V33">&nbsp;</a>God
<span class="add">is</span> my strength
<span class="add">and</span> power: and he maketh my way perfect.
 <span class="verse"> 34</span><a name="C22V34">&nbsp;</a>He maketh my feet like hinds
<span class="add">feet:</span> and setteth me upon my high places.
 <span class="verse"> 35</span><a name="C22V35">&nbsp;</a>He teacheth my hands to war; so that a bow of steel is broken by mine arms.
 <span class="verse"> 36</span><a name="C22V36">&nbsp;</a>Thou hast also given me the shield of thy salvation: and thy gentleness hath made me great.
 <span class="verse"> 37</span><a name="C22V37">&nbsp;</a>Thou hast enlarged my steps under me; so that my feet did not slip.
 <span class="verse"> 38</span><a name="C22V38">&nbsp;</a>I have pursued mine enemies, and destroyed them; and turned not again until I had consumed them.
 <span class="verse"> 39</span><a name="C22V39">&nbsp;</a>And I have consumed them, and wounded them, that they could not arise: yea, they are fallen under my
feet.
 <span class="verse"> 40</span><a name="C22V40">&nbsp;</a>For thou hast girded me with strength to battle: them that rose up against me hast thou subdued under
me.
 <span class="verse"> 41</span><a name="C22V41">&nbsp;</a>Thou hast also given me the necks of mine enemies, that I might destroy them that hate me.
 <span class="verse"> 42</span><a name="C22V42">&nbsp;</a>They looked, but
<span class="add">there was</span> none to save;
<span class="add">even</span> unto the LORD, but he answered them not.
 <span class="verse"> 43</span><a name="C22V43">&nbsp;</a>Then did I beat them as small as the dust of the earth, I did stamp them as the mire of the street,
<span class="add">and</span> did spread them abroad.
 <span class="verse"> 44</span><a name="C22V44">&nbsp;</a>Thou also hast delivered me from the strivings of my people, thou hast kept me
<span class="add">to be</span> head of the heathen: a people
<span class="add">which</span> I knew not shall serve me.
 <span class="verse"> 45</span><a name="C22V45">&nbsp;</a>Strangers shall submit themselves unto me: as soon as they hear, they shall be obedient unto me.
 <span class="verse"> 46</span><a name="C22V46">&nbsp;</a>Strangers shall fade away, and they shall be afraid out of their close places.
 <span class="verse"> 47</span><a name="C22V47">&nbsp;</a>The LORD liveth; and blessed
<span class="add">be</span> my rock; and exalted be the God of the rock of my salvation.
 <span class="verse"> 48</span><a name="C22V48">&nbsp;</a>It
<span class="add">is</span> God that avengeth me, and that bringeth down the people under me,
 <span class="verse"> 49</span><a name="C22V49">&nbsp;</a>And that bringeth me forth from mine enemies: thou also hast lifted me up on high above them that rose
up against me: thou hast delivered me from the violent man.
 <span class="verse"> 50</span><a name="C22V50">&nbsp;</a>Therefore I will give thanks unto thee, O LORD, among the heathen, and I will sing praises unto thy name.
 <span class="verse"> 51</span><a name="C22V51">&nbsp;</a><span class="add">He is</span> the tower of salvation for his king: and sheweth mercy to his anointed, unto David, and to his seed
for evermore.
