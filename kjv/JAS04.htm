 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C4V1">&nbsp;</a>From whence
<span class="add">come</span> wars and fightings among you?
<span class="add">come they</span> not hence,
<span class="add">even</span> of your lusts that war in your members?
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C4V2">&nbsp;</a>Ye lust, and have not: ye kill, and desire to have, and cannot obtain: ye fight and war, yet ye have
not, because ye ask not.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C4V3">&nbsp;</a>Ye ask, and receive not, because ye ask amiss, that ye may consume
<span class="add">it</span> upon your lusts.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C4V4">&nbsp;</a>Ye adulterers and adulteresses, know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity with God? whosoever
therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C4V5">&nbsp;</a>Do ye think that the scripture saith in vain, The spirit that dwelleth in us lusteth to envy?
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C4V6">&nbsp;</a>But he giveth more grace. Wherefore he saith, God resisteth the proud, but giveth grace unto the humble.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C4V7">&nbsp;</a>Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C4V8">&nbsp;</a>Draw nigh to God, and he will draw nigh to you. Cleanse
<span class="add">your</span> hands,
<span class="add">ye</span> sinners; and purify
<span class="add">your</span> hearts,
<span class="add">ye</span> double minded.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C4V9">&nbsp;</a>Be afflicted, and mourn, and weep: let your laughter be turned to mourning, and
<span class="add">your</span> joy to heaviness.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C4V10">&nbsp;</a>Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord, and he shall lift you up.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C4V11">&nbsp;</a>Speak not evil one of another, brethren. He that speaketh evil of
<span class="add">his</span> brother, and judgeth his brother, speaketh evil of the law, and judgeth the law: but if thou judge the
law, thou art not a doer of the law, but a judge.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C4V12">&nbsp;</a>There is one lawgiver, who is able to save and to destroy: who art thou that judgest another?
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C4V13">&nbsp;</a>Go to now, ye that say, To day or to morrow we will go into such a city, and continue there a year, and
buy and sell, and get gain:
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C4V14">&nbsp;</a>Whereas ye know not what
<span class="add">shall be</span> on the morrow. For what
<span class="add">is</span> your life? It is even a vapour, that appeareth for a little time, and then vanisheth away.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C4V15">&nbsp;</a>For that ye
<span class="add">ought</span> to say, If the Lord will, we shall live, and do this, or that.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C4V16">&nbsp;</a>But now ye rejoice in your boastings: all such rejoicing is evil.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C4V17">&nbsp;</a>Therefore to him that knoweth to do good, and doeth
<span class="add">it</span> not, to him it is sin.
