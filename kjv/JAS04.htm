Wherefore he saith, God resisteth the proud, but giveth grace unto the humble.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span> Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span> Draw nigh to God, and he will draw nigh to you. Cleanse <span class='add'>your</span> hands, <span class='add'>ye</span> sinners; and purify <span class='add'>your</span> hearts, <span class='add'>ye</span> double minded.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span> Be afflicted, and mourn, and weep: let your laughter be turned to mourning, and <span class='add'>your</span> joy to heaviness.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span> Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord, and he shall lift you up.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span> Speak not evil one of another, brethren. He that speaketh evil of <span class='add'>his</span> brother, and judgeth his brother, speaketh evil of the law, and judgeth the law: but if thou judge the law, thou art not a doer of the law, but a judge.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span> There is one lawgiver, who is able to save and to destroy: who art thou that judgest another? </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span> Go to now, ye that say, To day or to morrow we will go into such a city, and continue there a year, and buy and sell, and get gain:  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span> Whereas ye know not what <span class='add'>shall be</span> on the morrow. For what <span class='add'>is</span> your life? It is even a vapour, that appeareth for a little time, and then vanisheth away.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span> For that ye <span class='add'>ought</span> to say, If the Lord will, we shall live, and do this, or that.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span> But now ye rejoice in your boastings: all such rejoicing is evil.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span> Therefore to him that knoweth to do good, and doeth <span class='add'>it</span> not, to him it is sin. </div><ul class='tnav'>
