<div class="chapterlabel"> 8</div><div class="p">
 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C8V1">&nbsp;</a><span class="add">There is</span> therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after
the Spirit.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C8V2">&nbsp;</a>For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C8V3">&nbsp;</a>For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending his own Son in the
likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh:
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C8V4">&nbsp;</a>That the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the
Spirit.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C8V5">&nbsp;</a>For they that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh; but they that are after the Spirit
the things of the Spirit.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C8V6">&nbsp;</a>For to be carnally minded
<span class="add">is</span> death; but to be spiritually minded
<span class="add">is</span> life and peace.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C8V7">&nbsp;</a>Because the carnal mind
<span class="add">is</span> enmity against God: for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C8V8">&nbsp;</a>So then they that are in the flesh cannot please God.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C8V9">&nbsp;</a>But ye are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you. Now if
any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C8V10">&nbsp;</a>And if Christ
<span class="add">be</span> in you, the body
<span class="add">is</span> dead because of sin; but the Spirit
<span class="add">is</span> life because of righteousness.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C8V11">&nbsp;</a>But if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, he that raised up Christ from
the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in you.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C8V12">&nbsp;</a>Therefore, brethren, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live after the flesh.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C8V13">&nbsp;</a>For if ye live after the flesh, ye shall die: but if ye through the Spirit do mortify the deeds of the
body, ye shall live.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C8V14">&nbsp;</a>For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C8V15">&nbsp;</a>For ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear; but ye have received the Spirit of adoption,
whereby we cry, Abba, Father.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C8V16">&nbsp;</a>The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we are the children of God:
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C8V17">&nbsp;</a>And if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ; if so be that we suffer with
<span class="add">him,</span> that we may be also glorified together.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C8V18">&nbsp;</a>For I reckon that the sufferings of this present time
<span class="add">are
</span> not worthy
<span class="add">to be compared</span> with the glory which shall be revealed in us.
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C8V19">&nbsp;</a>For the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God.
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C8V20">&nbsp;</a>For the creature was made subject to vanity, not willingly, but by reason of him who hath subjected
<span class="add">the same</span> in hope,
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C8V21">&nbsp;</a>Because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious
liberty of the children of God.
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C8V22">&nbsp;</a>For we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now.
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C8V23">&nbsp;</a>And not only
<span class="add">they,</span> but ourselves also, which have the firstfruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves,
waiting for the adoption,
<span class="add">to wit,</span> the redemption of our body.
 <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C8V24">&nbsp;</a>For we are saved by hope: but hope that is seen is not hope: for what a man seeth, why doth he yet hope
for?
 <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C8V25">&nbsp;</a>But if we hope for that we see not,
<span class="add">then</span> do we with patience wait for
<span class="add">it.
</span> <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C8V26">&nbsp;</a>Likewise the Spirit also helpeth our infirmities: for we know not what we should pray for as we ought:
but the Spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered.
 <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C8V27">&nbsp;</a>And he that searcheth the hearts knoweth what
<span class="add">is</span> the mind of the Spirit, because he maketh intercession for the saints according to
<span class="add">the will of</span> God.
 <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C8V28">&nbsp;</a>And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called
according to
<span class="add">his</span> purpose.
 <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C8V29">&nbsp;</a>For whom he did foreknow, he also did predestinate
<span class="add">to be
</span> conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brethren.
 <span class="verse"> 30</span><a name="C8V30">&nbsp;</a>Moreover whom he did predestinate, them he also called: and whom he called, them he also justified: and
whom he justified, them he also glorified.
 <span class="verse"> 31</span><a name="C8V31">&nbsp;</a>What shall we then say to these things? If God
<span class="add">be</span> for us, who
<span class="add">can be</span> against us?
 <span class="verse"> 32</span><a name="C8V32">&nbsp;</a>He that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how shall he not with him also freely
give us all things?
 <span class="verse"> 33</span><a name="C8V33">&nbsp;</a>Who shall lay any thing to the charge of God’s elect?
<span class="add">It is
</span> God that justifieth.
 <span class="verse"> 34</span><a name="C8V34">&nbsp;</a>Who
<span class="add">is</span> he that condemneth?
<span class="add">It is</span> Christ that died, yea rather, that is risen again, who is even at the right hand of God, who also maketh
intercession for us.
 <span class="verse"> 35</span><a name="C8V35">&nbsp;</a>Who shall separate us from the love of Christ?
<span class="add">shall</span> tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword?
 <span class="verse"> 36</span><a name="C8V36">&nbsp;</a>As it is written, For thy sake we are killed all the day long; we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter.
 <span class="verse"> 37</span><a name="C8V37">&nbsp;</a>Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us.
 <span class="verse"> 38</span><a name="C8V38">&nbsp;</a>For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things
present, nor things to come,
 <span class="verse"> 39</span><a name="C8V39">&nbsp;</a>Nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which
is in Christ Jesus our Lord.
