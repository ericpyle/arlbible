<div class="mt1">The Epistle [or Letter] of Jeremiah [Jeremy]
</div>
<div class="chapterlabel"> 6</div><div class="p">
 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C6V1">&nbsp;</a>A copy of an epistle, which Jeremy sent unto them which were to be led captives into Babylon by the king
of the Babylonians, to certify them, as it was commanded him of God.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C6V2">&nbsp;</a>Because of the sins which ye have committed before God, ye shall be led away captives into Babylon by
Nabuchodonosor king of the Babylonians.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C6V3">&nbsp;</a>So when ye be come unto Babylon, ye shall remain there many years, and for a long season, namely, seven
generations: and after that I will bring you away peaceably from thence.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C6V4">&nbsp;</a>Now shall ye see in Babylon gods of silver, and of gold, and of wood, borne upon shoulders, which cause
the nations to fear.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C6V5">&nbsp;</a>Beware therefore that ye in no wise be like to strangers, neither be ye and of them, when ye see the
multitude before them and behind them, worshipping them.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C6V6">&nbsp;</a>But say ye in your hearts, O Lord, we must worship thee.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C6V7">&nbsp;</a>For mine angel is with you, and I myself caring for your souls.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C6V8">&nbsp;</a>As for their tongue, it is polished by the workman, and they themselves are gilded and laid over with
silver; yet are they but false, and cannot speak.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C6V9">&nbsp;</a>And taking gold, as it were for a virgin that loveth to go gay, they make crowns for the heads of their
gods.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C6V10">&nbsp;</a>Sometimes also the priests convey from their gods gold and silver, and bestow it upon themselves.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C6V11">&nbsp;</a>Yea, they will give thereof to the common harlots, and deck them as men with garments,
<span class="add">being</span> gods of silver, and gods of gold, and wood.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C6V12">&nbsp;</a>Yet cannot these gods save themselves from rust and moth, though they be covered with purple raiment.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C6V13">&nbsp;</a>They wipe their faces because of the dust of the temple, when there is much upon them.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C6V14">&nbsp;</a>And he that cannot put to death one that offendeth him holdeth a sceptre, as though he were a judge of
the country.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C6V15">&nbsp;</a>He hath also in his right hand a dagger and an ax: but cannot deliver himself from war and thieves.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C6V16">&nbsp;</a>Whereby they are known not to be gods: therefore fear them not.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C6V17">&nbsp;</a>For like as a vessel that a man useth is nothing worth when it is broken; even so it is with their gods:
when they be set up in the temple, their eyes be full of dust through the feet of them that come in.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C6V18">&nbsp;</a>And as the doors are made sure on every side upon him that offendeth the king, as being committed to
suffer death: even so the priests make fast their temples with doors, with locks, and bars, lest their
gods be spoiled with robbers.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C6V19">&nbsp;</a>They light them candles, yea, more than for themselves, whereof they cannot see one.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C6V20">&nbsp;</a>They are as one of the beams of the temple, yet they say their hearts are gnawed upon by things creeping
out of the earth; and when they eat them and their clothes, they feel it not.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C6V21">&nbsp;</a>Their faces are blacked through the smoke that cometh out of the temple.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C6V22">&nbsp;</a>Upon their bodies and heads sit bats, swallows, and birds, and the cats also.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C6V23">&nbsp;</a>By this ye may know that they are no gods: therefore fear them not.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C6V24">&nbsp;</a>Notwithstanding the gold that is about them to make them beautiful, except they wipe off the rust, they
will not shine: for neither when they were molten did they feel it.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C6V25">&nbsp;</a>The things wherein there is no breath are bought for a most high price.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C6V26">&nbsp;</a>They are borne upon shoulders, having no feet whereby they declare unto men that they be nothing worth.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C6V27">&nbsp;</a>They also that serve them are ashamed: for if they fall to the ground at any time, they cannot rise up
again of themselves: neither, if one set them upright, can they move of themselves: neither, if they
be bowed down, can they make themselves straight: but they set gifts before them as unto dead men.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C6V28">&nbsp;</a>As for the things that are sacrificed unto them, their priests sell and abuse; in like manner their wives
lay up part thereof in salt; but unto the poor and impotent they give nothing of it.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C6V29">&nbsp;</a>Menstruous women and women in childbed eat their sacrifices: by these things ye may know that they are
no gods: fear them not.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 30</span><a name="C6V30">&nbsp;</a>For how can they be called gods? because women set meat before the gods of silver, gold, and wood.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 31</span><a name="C6V31">&nbsp;</a>And the priests sit in their temples, having their clothes rent, and their heads and beards shaven, and
nothing upon their heads.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 32</span><a name="C6V32">&nbsp;</a>They roar and cry before their gods, as men do at the feast when one is dead.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 33</span><a name="C6V33">&nbsp;</a>The priests also take off their garments, and clothe their wives and children.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 34</span><a name="C6V34">&nbsp;</a>Whether it be evil that one doeth unto them, or good, they are not able to recompense it: they can neither
set up a king, nor put him down.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 35</span><a name="C6V35">&nbsp;</a>In like manner, they can neither give riches nor money: though a man make a vow unto them, and keep it
not, they will not require it.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 36</span><a name="C6V36">&nbsp;</a>They can save no man from death, neither deliver the weak from the mighty.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 37</span><a name="C6V37">&nbsp;</a>They cannot restore a blind man to his sight, nor help any man in his distress.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 38</span><a name="C6V38">&nbsp;</a>They can shew no mercy to the widow, nor do good to the fatherless.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 39</span><a name="C6V39">&nbsp;</a>Their gods of wood, and which are overlaid with gold and silver, are like the stones that be hewn out
of the mountain: they that worship them shall be confounded.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 40</span><a name="C6V40">&nbsp;</a>How should a man then think and say that they are gods, when even the Chaldeans themselves dishonour
them?
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 41</span><a name="C6V41">&nbsp;</a>Who if they shall see one dumb that cannot speak, they bring him, and intreat Bel that he may speak,
as though he were able to understand.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 42</span><a name="C6V42">&nbsp;</a>Yet they cannot understand this themselves, and leave them: for they have no knowledge.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 43</span><a name="C6V43">&nbsp;</a>The women also with cords about them, sitting in the ways, burn bran for perfume: but if any of them,
drawn by some that passeth by, lie with him, she reproacheth her fellow, that she was not thought as
worthy as herself, nor her cord broken.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 44</span><a name="C6V44">&nbsp;</a>Whatsoever is done among them is false: how may it then be thought or said that they are gods?
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 45</span><a name="C6V45">&nbsp;</a>They are made of carpenters and goldsmiths: they can be nothing else than the workmen will have them
to be.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 46</span><a name="C6V46">&nbsp;</a>And they themselves that made them can never continue long; how should then the things that are made
of them be gods?
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 47</span><a name="C6V47">&nbsp;</a>For they left lies and reproaches to them that come after.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 48</span><a name="C6V48">&nbsp;</a>For when there cometh any war or plague upon them, the priests consult with themselves, where they may
be hidden with them.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 49</span><a name="C6V49">&nbsp;</a>How then cannot men perceive that they be no gods, which can neither save themselves from war, nor from
plague?
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 50</span><a name="C6V50">&nbsp;</a>For seeing they be but of wood, and overlaid with silver and gold, it shall be known hereafter that they
are false:
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 51</span><a name="C6V51">&nbsp;</a>And it shall manifestly appear to all nations and kings that they are no gods, but the works of men’s
hands, and that there is no work of God in them.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 52</span><a name="C6V52">&nbsp;</a>Who then may not know that they are no gods?
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 53</span><a name="C6V53">&nbsp;</a>For neither can they set up a king in the land, nor give rain unto men.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 54</span><a name="C6V54">&nbsp;</a>Neither can they judge their own cause, nor redress a wrong, being unable: for they are as crows between
heaven and earth.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 55</span><a name="C6V55">&nbsp;</a>Whereupon when fire falleth upon the house of gods of wood, or laid over with gold or silver, their priests
will flee away, and escape; but they themselves shall be burned asunder like beams.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 56</span><a name="C6V56">&nbsp;</a>Moreover they cannot withstand any king or enemies: how can it then be thought or said that they be gods?
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 57</span><a name="C6V57">&nbsp;</a>Neither are those gods of wood, and laid over with silver or gold, able to escape either from thieves
or robbers.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 58</span><a name="C6V58">&nbsp;</a>Whose gold, and silver, and garments wherewith they are clothed, they that are strong take, and go away
withal: neither are they able to help themselves.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 59</span><a name="C6V59">&nbsp;</a>Therefore it is better to be a king that sheweth his power, or else a profitable vessel in an house,
which the owner shall have use of, than such false gods; or to be a door in an house, to keep such things
therein, than such false gods. or a pillar of wood in a a palace, than such false gods.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 60</span><a name="C6V60">&nbsp;</a>For sun, moon, and stars, being bright and sent to do their offices, are obedient.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 61</span><a name="C6V61">&nbsp;</a>In like manner the lightning when it breaketh forth is easy to be seen; and after the same manner the
wind bloweth in every country.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 62</span><a name="C6V62">&nbsp;</a>And when God commandeth the clouds to go over the whole world, they do as they are bidden.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 63</span><a name="C6V63">&nbsp;</a>And the fire sent from above to consume hills and woods doeth as it is commanded: but these are like
unto them neither in shew nor power.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 64</span><a name="C6V64">&nbsp;</a>Wherefore it is neither to be supposed nor said that they are gods, seeing, they are able neither to
judge causes, nor to do good unto men.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 65</span><a name="C6V65">&nbsp;</a>Knowing therefore that they are no gods, fear them not,
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 66</span><a name="C6V66">&nbsp;</a>For they can neither curse nor bless kings:
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 67</span><a name="C6V67">&nbsp;</a>Neither can they shew signs in the heavens among the heathen, nor shine as the sun, nor give light as
the moon.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 68</span><a name="C6V68">&nbsp;</a>The beasts are better than they: for they can get under a cover and help themselves.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 69</span><a name="C6V69">&nbsp;</a>It is then by no means manifest unto us that they are gods: therefore fear them not.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 70</span><a name="C6V70">&nbsp;</a>For as a scarecrow in a garden of cucumbers keepeth nothing: so are their gods of wood, and laid over
with silver and gold.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 71</span><a name="C6V71">&nbsp;</a>And likewise their gods of wood, and laid over with silver and gold, are like to a white thorn in an
orchard, that every bird sitteth upon; as also to a dead body, that is east into the dark.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 72</span><a name="C6V72">&nbsp;</a>And ye shall know them to be no gods by the bright purple that rotteth upon then1: and they themselves
afterward shall be eaten, and shall be a reproach in the country.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 73</span><a name="C6V73">&nbsp;</a>Better therefore is the just man that hath none idols: for he shall be far from reproach.
