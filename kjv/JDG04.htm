 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C4V1">&nbsp;</a>And the children of Israel again did evil in the sight of the LORD, when Ehud was dead.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C4V2">&nbsp;</a>And the LORD sold them into the hand of Jabin king of Canaan, that reigned in Hazor; the captain of whose
host
<span class="add">was</span> Sisera, which dwelt in Harosheth of the Gentiles.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C4V3">&nbsp;</a>And the children of Israel cried unto the LORD: for he had nine hundred chariots of iron; and twenty
years he mightily oppressed the children of Israel.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C4V4">&nbsp;</a>And Deborah, a prophetess, the wife of Lapidoth, she judged Israel at that time.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C4V5">&nbsp;</a>And she dwelt under the palm tree of Deborah between Ramah and Bethel in mount Ephraim: and the children
of Israel came up to her for judgment.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C4V6">&nbsp;</a>And she sent and called Barak the son of Abinoam out of Kedesh-naphtali, and said unto him, Hath not
the LORD God of Israel commanded,
<span class="add">saying,
</span> Go and draw toward mount Tabor, and take with thee ten thousand men of the children of Naphtali and
of the children of Zebulun?
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C4V7">&nbsp;</a>And I will draw unto thee to the river Kishon Sisera, the captain of Jabin’s army, with his chariots
and his multitude; and I will deliver him into thine hand.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C4V8">&nbsp;</a>And Barak said unto her, If thou wilt go with me, then I will go: but if thou wilt not go with me,
<span class="add">then</span> I will not go.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C4V9">&nbsp;</a>And she said, I will surely go with thee: notwithstanding the journey that thou takest shall not be for
thine honour; for the LORD shall sell Sisera into the hand of a woman. And Deborah arose, and went with
Barak to Kedesh.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C4V10">&nbsp;</a>And Barak called Zebulun and Naphtali to Kedesh; and he went up with ten thousand men at his feet: and
Deborah went up with him.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C4V11">&nbsp;</a>Now Heber the Kenite,
<span class="add">which was</span> of the children of Hobab the father in law of Moses, had severed himself from the Kenites, and pitched
his tent unto the plain of Zaanaim, which
<span class="add">is</span> by Kedesh.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C4V12">&nbsp;</a>And they shewed Sisera that Barak the son of Abinoam was gone up to mount Tabor.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C4V13">&nbsp;</a>And Sisera gathered together all his chariots,
<span class="add">even</span> nine hundred chariots of iron, and all the people that
<span class="add">were</span> with him, from Harosheth of the Gentiles unto the river of Kishon.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C4V14">&nbsp;</a>And Deborah said unto Barak, Up; for this
<span class="add">is</span> the day in which the LORD hath delivered Sisera into thine hand: is not the LORD gone out before thee?
So Barak went down from mount Tabor, and ten thousand men after him.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C4V15">&nbsp;</a>And the LORD discomfited Sisera, and all
<span class="add">his</span> chariots, and all
<span class="add">his</span> host, with the edge of the sword before Barak; so that Sisera lighted down off
<span class="add">his</span> chariot, and fled away on his feet.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C4V16">&nbsp;</a>But Barak pursued after the chariots, and after the host, unto Harosheth of the Gentiles: and all the
host of Sisera fell upon the edge of the sword;
<span class="add">and</span> there was not a man left.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C4V17">&nbsp;</a>Howbeit Sisera fled away on his feet to the tent of Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite: for
<span class="add">there was</span> peace between Jabin the king of Hazor and the house of Heber the Kenite.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C4V18">&nbsp;</a>And Jael went out to meet Sisera, and said unto him, Turn in, my lord, turn in to me; fear not. And when
he had turned in unto her into the tent, she covered him with a mantle.
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C4V19">&nbsp;</a>And he said unto her, Give me, I pray thee, a little water to drink; for I am thirsty. And she opened
a bottle of milk, and gave him drink, and covered him.
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C4V20">&nbsp;</a>Again he said unto her, Stand in the door of the tent, and it shall be, when any man doth come and enquire
of thee, and say, Is there any man here? that thou shalt say, No.
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C4V21">&nbsp;</a>Then Jael Heber’s wife took a nail of the tent, and took an hammer in her hand, and went softly unto
him, and smote the nail into his temples, and fastened it into the ground: for he was fast asleep and
weary. So he died.
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C4V22">&nbsp;</a>And, behold, as Barak pursued Sisera, Jael came out to meet him, and said unto him, Come, and I will
shew thee the man whom thou seekest. And when he came into her
<span class="add">tent,</span> behold, Sisera lay dead, and the nail
<span class="add">was</span> in his temples.
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C4V23">&nbsp;</a>So God subdued on that day Jabin the king of Canaan before the children of Israel.
 <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C4V24">&nbsp;</a>And the hand of the children of Israel prospered, and prevailed against Jabin the king of Canaan, until
they had destroyed Jabin king of Canaan.
