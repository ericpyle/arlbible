 <span class="verse" id="V1">1&nbsp;</span>Now these <span class='add'>are</span> the names of the children of Israel, which came into Egypt; every man and his household came with Jacob.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span>Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah,  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>Issachar, Zebulun, and Benjamin,  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>Dan, and Naphtali, Gad, and Asher.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>And all the souls that came out of the loins of Jacob were seventy souls: for Joseph was in Egypt <span class='add'>already</span>.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>And Joseph died, and all his brethren, and all that generation. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>And the children of Israel were fruitful, and increased abundantly, and multiplied, and waxed exceeding mighty; and the land was filled with them.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>Now there arose up a new king over Egypt, which knew not Joseph.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>And he said unto his people, Behold, the people of the children of Israel <span class='add'>are</span> more and mightier than we:  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>Come on, let us deal wisely with them; lest they multiply, and it come to pass, that, when there falleth out any war, they join also unto our enemies, and fight against us, and <span class='add'>so</span> get them up out of the land.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>Therefore they did set over them taskmasters to afflict them with their burdens. And they built for Pharaoh treasure cities, Pithom and Raamses.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>But the more they afflicted them, the more they multiplied and grew. And they were grieved because of the children of Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>And the Egyptians made the children of Israel to serve with rigour:  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>And they made their lives bitter with hard bondage, in morter, and in brick, and in all manner of service in the field: all their service, wherein they made them serve, <span class='add'>was</span> with rigour. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>And the king of Egypt spake to the Hebrew midwives, of which the name of the one <span class='add'>was</span> Shiphrah, and the name of the other Puah:  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>And he said, When ye do the office of a midwife to the Hebrew women, and see <span class='add'>them</span> upon the stools; if it <span class='add'>be</span> a son, then ye shall kill him: but if it <span class='add'>be</span> a daughter, then she shall live.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>But the midwives feared God, and did not as the king of Egypt commanded them, but saved the men children alive.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>And the king of Egypt called for the midwives, and said unto them, Why have ye done this thing, and have saved the men children alive?  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>And the midwives said unto Pharaoh, Because the Hebrew women <span class='add'>are</span> not as the Egyptian women; for they <span class='add'>are</span> lively, and are delivered ere the midwives come in unto them.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>Therefore God dealt well with the midwives: and the people multiplied, and waxed very mighty.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>And it came to pass, because the midwives feared God, that he made them houses.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>And Pharaoh charged all his people, saying, Every son that is born ye shall cast into the river, and every daughter ye shall save alive. </div><ul class='tnav'>
