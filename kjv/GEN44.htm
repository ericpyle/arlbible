<div><a name="C44V0"><hr></a>
<div class="chapterlabel"> 44</div><div class="p">
 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C44V1">&nbsp;</a>And he commanded the steward of his house, saying, Fill the men’s sacks
<span class="add">with</span> food, as much as they can carry, and put every man’s money in his sack’s mouth.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C44V2">&nbsp;</a>And put my cup, the silver cup, in the sack’s mouth of the youngest, and his corn money. And he did according
to the word that Joseph had spoken.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C44V3">&nbsp;</a>As soon as the morning was light, the men were sent away, they and their asses.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C44V4">&nbsp;</a><span class="add">And</span> when they were gone out of the city,
<span class="add">and</span> not
<span class="add">yet</span> far off, Joseph said unto his steward, Up, follow after the men; and when thou dost overtake them, say
unto them, Wherefore have ye rewarded evil for good?
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C44V5">&nbsp;</a><span class="add">Is</span> not this
<span class="add">it</span> in which my lord drinketh, and whereby indeed he divineth? ye have done evil in so doing.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C44V6">&nbsp;</a>And he overtook them, and he spake unto them these same words.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C44V7">&nbsp;</a>And they said unto him, Wherefore saith my lord these words? God forbid that thy servants should do according
to this thing:
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C44V8">&nbsp;</a>Behold, the money, which we found in our sacks’ mouths, we brought again unto thee out of the land of
Canaan: how then should we steal out of thy lord’s house silver or gold?
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C44V9">&nbsp;</a>With whomsoever of thy servants it be found, both let him die, and we also will be my lord’s bondmen.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C44V10">&nbsp;</a>And he said, Now also
<span class="add">let</span> it
<span class="add">be</span> according unto your words; he with whom it is found shall be my servant; and ye shall be blameless.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C44V11">&nbsp;</a>Then they speedily took down every man his sack to the ground, and opened every man his sack.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C44V12">&nbsp;</a>And he searched,
<span class="add">and</span> began at the eldest, and left at the youngest: and the cup was found in Benjamin’s sack.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C44V13">&nbsp;</a>Then they rent their clothes, and laded every man his ass, and returned to the city.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C44V14">&nbsp;</a>And Judah and his brethren came to Joseph’s house; for he
<span class="add">was
</span> yet there: and they fell before him on the ground.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C44V15">&nbsp;</a>And Joseph said unto them, What deed
<span class="add">is</span> this that ye have done? wot ye not that such a man as I can certainly divine?
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C44V16">&nbsp;</a>And Judah said, What shall we say unto my lord? what shall we speak? or how shall we clear ourselves?
God hath found out the iniquity of thy servants: behold, we
<span class="add">are</span> my lord’s servants, both we, and
<span class="add">he</span> also with whom the cup is found.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C44V17">&nbsp;</a>And he said, God forbid that I should do so:
<span class="add">but</span> the man in whose hand the cup is found, he shall be my servant; and as for you, get you up in peace
unto your father.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C44V18">&nbsp;</a>Then Judah came near unto him, and said, Oh my lord, let thy servant, I pray thee, speak a word in my
lord’s ears, and let not thine anger burn against thy servant: for thou
<span class="add">art</span> even as Pharaoh.
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C44V19">&nbsp;</a>My lord asked his servants, saying, Have ye a father, or a brother?
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C44V20">&nbsp;</a>And we said unto my lord, We have a father, an old man, and a child of his old age, a little one; and
his brother is dead, and he alone is left of his mother, and his father loveth him.
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C44V21">&nbsp;</a>And thou saidst unto thy servants, Bring him down unto me, that I may set mine eyes upon him.
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C44V22">&nbsp;</a>And we said unto my lord, The lad cannot leave his father: for
<span class="add">if</span> he should leave his father,
<span class="add">his father</span> would die.
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C44V23">&nbsp;</a>And thou saidst unto thy servants, Except your youngest brother come down with you, ye shall see my face
no more.
 <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C44V24">&nbsp;</a>And it came to pass when we came up unto thy servant my father, we told him the words of my lord.
 <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C44V25">&nbsp;</a>And our father said, Go again,
<span class="add">and</span> buy us a little food.
 <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C44V26">&nbsp;</a>And we said, We cannot go down: if our youngest brother be with us, then will we go down: for we may
not see the man’s face, except our youngest brother
<span class="add">be</span> with us.
 <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C44V27">&nbsp;</a>And thy servant my father said unto us, Ye know that my wife bare me two
<span class="add">sons:
</span> <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C44V28">&nbsp;</a>And the one went out from me, and I said, Surely he is torn in pieces; and I saw him not since:
 <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C44V29">&nbsp;</a>And if ye take this also from me, and mischief befall him, ye shall bring down my gray hairs with sorrow
to the grave.
 <span class="verse"> 30</span><a name="C44V30">&nbsp;</a>Now therefore when I come to thy servant my father, and the lad
<span class="add">be</span> not with us; seeing that his life is bound up in the lad’s life;
 <span class="verse"> 31</span><a name="C44V31">&nbsp;</a>It shall come to pass, when he seeth that the lad
<span class="add">is</span> not
<span class="add">with us,</span> that he will die: and thy servants shall bring down the gray hairs of thy servant our father with sorrow
to the grave.
 <span class="verse"> 32</span><a name="C44V32">&nbsp;</a>For thy servant became surety for the lad unto my father, saying, If I bring him not unto thee, then
I shall bear the blame to my father for ever.
 <span class="verse"> 33</span><a name="C44V33">&nbsp;</a>Now therefore, I pray thee, let thy servant abide instead of the lad a bondman to my lord; and let the
lad go up with his brethren.
 <span class="verse"> 34</span><a name="C44V34">&nbsp;</a>For how shall I go up to my father, and the lad
<span class="add">be</span> not with me? lest peradventure I see the evil that shall come on my father.
