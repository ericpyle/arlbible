<div><a name="C9V0"><hr></a>
<div class="chapterlabel"> 9</div><div class="p">
 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C9V1">&nbsp;</a>He answered me then, and said, Measure thou the time diligently in itself: and when thou seest part of
the signs past, which I have told thee before,
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C9V2">&nbsp;</a>Then shalt thou understand, that it is the very same time, wherein the Highest will begin to visit the
world which he made.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C9V3">&nbsp;</a>Therefore when there shall be seen earthquakes and uproars of the people in the world:
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C9V4">&nbsp;</a>Then shalt thou well understand, that the most High spake of those things from the days that were before
thee, even from the beginning.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C9V5">&nbsp;</a>For like as all that is made in the world hath a beginning and an end, and the end is manifest:
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C9V6">&nbsp;</a>Even so the times also of the Highest have plain beginnings in wonder and powerful works, and endings
in effects and signs.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C9V7">&nbsp;</a>And every one that shall be saved, and shall be able to escape by his works, and by faith, whereby ye
have believed,
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C9V8">&nbsp;</a>Shall be preserved from the said perils, and shall see my salvation in my land, and within my borders:
for I have sanctified them for me from the beginning.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C9V9">&nbsp;</a>Then shall they be in pitiful case, which now have abused my ways: and they that have cast them away
despitefully shall dwell in torments.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C9V10">&nbsp;</a>For such as in their life have received benefits, and have not known me;
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C9V11">&nbsp;</a>And they that have loathed my law, while they had yet liberty, and, when as yet place of repentance was
open unto them, understood not, but despised it;
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C9V12">&nbsp;</a>The same must know it after death by pain.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C9V13">&nbsp;</a>And therefore be thou not curious how the ungodly shall be punished, and when: but enquire how the righteous
shall be saved, whose the world is, and for whom the world is created.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C9V14">&nbsp;</a>Then answered I and said,
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C9V15">&nbsp;</a>I have said before, and now do speak, and will speak it also hereafter, that there be many more of them
which perish, than of them which shall be saved:
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C9V16">&nbsp;</a>Like as a wave is greater than a drop.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C9V17">&nbsp;</a>And he answered me, saying, Like as the field is, so is also the seed; as the flowers be, such are the
colours also; such as the workman is, such also is the work; and as the husbandman ls himself, so is
his husbandry also: for it was the time of the world.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C9V18">&nbsp;</a>And now when I prepared the world, which was not yet made, even for them to dwell in that now live, no
man spake against me.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C9V19">&nbsp;</a>For then every one obeyed: but now the manners of them which are created in this world that is made are
corrupted by a perpetual seed, and by a law which is unsearchable rid themselves.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C9V20">&nbsp;</a>So I considered the world, and, behold, there was peril because of the devices that were come into it.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C9V21">&nbsp;</a>And I saw, and spared it greatly, and have kept me a grape of the cluster, and a plant of a great people.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C9V22">&nbsp;</a>Let the multitude perish then, which was born in vain; and let my grape be kept, and my plant; for with
great labour have I made it perfect.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C9V23">&nbsp;</a>Nevertheless, if thou wilt cease yet seven days more, (but thou shalt not fast in them,
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C9V24">&nbsp;</a>But go into a field of flowers, where no house is builded, and eat only the flowers of the field; taste
no flesh, drink no wine, but eat flowers only;)
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C9V25">&nbsp;</a>And pray unto the Highest continually, then will I come and talk with thee.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C9V26">&nbsp;</a>So I went my way into the field which is called Ardath, like as he commanded me; and there I sat among
the flowers, and did eat of the herbs of the field, and the meat of the same satisfied me.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C9V27">&nbsp;</a>After seven days I sat upon the grass, and my heart was vexed within me, like as before:
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C9V28">&nbsp;</a>And I opened my mouth, and began to talk before the most High, and said,
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C9V29">&nbsp;</a>O Lord, thou that shewest thyself unto us, thou wast shewed unto our fathers in the wilderness, in a
place where no man treadeth, in a barren place, when they came out of Egypt.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 30</span><a name="C9V30">&nbsp;</a>And thou spakest saying, Hear me, O Israel; and mark my words, thou seed of Jacob.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 31</span><a name="C9V31">&nbsp;</a>For, behold, I sow my law in you, and it shall bring fruit in you, and ye shall be honoured in it for
ever.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 32</span><a name="C9V32">&nbsp;</a>But our fathers, which received the law, kept it not, and observed not thy ordinances: and though the
fruit of thy law did not perish, neither could it, for it was thine;
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 33</span><a name="C9V33">&nbsp;</a>Yet they that received it perished, because they kept not the thing that was sown in them.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 34</span><a name="C9V34">&nbsp;</a>And, lo, it is a custom, when the ground hath received seed, or the sea a ship, or any vessel meat or
drink, that, that being perished wherein it was sown or cast into,
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 35</span><a name="C9V35">&nbsp;</a>That thing also which was sown, or cast therein, or received, doth perish, and remaineth not with us:
but with us it hath not happened so.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 36</span><a name="C9V36">&nbsp;</a>For we that have received the law perish by sin, and our heart also which received it
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 37</span><a name="C9V37">&nbsp;</a>Notwithstanding the law perisheth not, but remaineth in his force.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 38</span><a name="C9V38">&nbsp;</a>And when I spake these things in my heart, I looked back with mine eyes, and upon the right side I saw
a woman, and, behold, she mourned and wept with a loud voice, and was much grieved in heart, and her
clothes were rent, and she had ashes upon her head.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 39</span><a name="C9V39">&nbsp;</a>Then let I my thoughts go that I was in, and turned me unto her,
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 40</span><a name="C9V40">&nbsp;</a>And said unto her, Wherefore weepest thou? why art thou so grieved in thy mind?
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 41</span><a name="C9V41">&nbsp;</a>And she said unto me, Sir, let me alone, that I may bewail myself, and add unto my sorrow, for I am sore
vexed in my mind, and brought very low.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 42</span><a name="C9V42">&nbsp;</a>And I said unto her, What aileth thee? tell me.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 43</span><a name="C9V43">&nbsp;</a>She said unto me, I thy servant have been barren, and had no child, though I had an husband thirty years,
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 44</span><a name="C9V44">&nbsp;</a>And those thirty years I did nothing else day and night, and every hour, but make my, prayer to the Highest.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 45</span><a name="C9V45">&nbsp;</a>After thirty years God heard me thine handmaid, looked upon my misery, considered my trouble, and gave
me a son: and I was very glad of him, so was my husband also, and all my neighbours: and we gave great
honour unto the Almighty.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 46</span><a name="C9V46">&nbsp;</a>And I nourished him with great travail.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 47</span><a name="C9V47">&nbsp;</a>So when he grew up, and came to the time that he should have a wife, I made a feast.
