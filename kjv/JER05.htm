 <span class="verse" id="V1">1&nbsp;</span>Run ye to and fro through the streets of Jerusalem, and see now, and know, and seek in the broad places thereof, if ye can find a man, if there be <span class='add'>any</span> that executeth judgment, that seeketh the truth; and I will pardon it.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span>And though they say, The LORD liveth; surely they swear falsely.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>O LORD, <span class='add'>are</span> not thine eyes upon the truth? thou hast stricken them, but they have not grieved; thou hast consumed them, <span class='add'>but</span> they have refused to receive correction: they have made their faces harder than a rock; they have refused to return.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>Therefore I said, Surely these <span class='add'>are</span> poor; they are foolish: for they know not the way of the LORD, <span class='add'>nor</span> the judgment of their God.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>I will get me unto the great men, and will speak unto them; for they have known the way of the LORD, <span class='add'>and</span> the judgment of their God: but these have altogether broken the yoke, <span class='add'>and</span> burst the bonds.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>Wherefore a lion out of the forest shall slay them, <span class='add'>and</span> a wolf of the evenings shall spoil them, a leopard shall watch over their cities: every one that goeth out thence shall be torn in pieces: because their transgressions are many, <span class='add'>and</span> their backslidings are increased. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>How shall I pardon thee for this? thy children have forsaken me, and sworn by <span class='add'>them that are</span> no gods: when I had fed them to the full, they then committed adultery, and assembled themselves by troops in the harlots’ houses.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>They were <span class='add'>as</span> fed horses in the morning: every one neighed after his neighbour’s wife.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>Shall I not visit for these <span class='add'>things?</span> saith the LORD: and shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this? </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>Go ye up upon her walls, and destroy; but make not a full end: take away her battlements; for they <span class='add'>are</span> not the LORD’s.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>For the house of Israel and the house of Judah have dealt very treacherously against me, saith the LORD.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>They have belied the LORD, and said, <span class='add'>It is</span> not he; neither shall evil come upon us; neither shall we see sword nor famine:  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>And the prophets shall become wind, and the word <span class='add'>is</span> not in them: thus shall it be done unto them.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>Wherefore thus saith the LORD God of hosts, Because ye speak this word, behold, I will make my words in thy mouth fire, and this people wood, and it shall devour them.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>Lo, I will bring a nation upon you from far, O house of Israel, saith the LORD: it <span class='add'>is</span> a mighty nation, it <span class='add'>is</span> an ancient nation, a nation whose language thou knowest not, neither understandest what they say.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>Their quiver <span class='add'>is</span> as an open sepulchre, they <span class='add'>are</span> all mighty men.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>And they shall eat up thine harvest, and thy bread, <span class='add'>which</span> thy sons and thy daughters should eat: they shall eat up thy flocks and thine herds: they shall eat up thy vines and thy fig trees: they shall impoverish thy fenced cities, wherein thou trustedst, with the sword.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>Nevertheless in those days, saith the LORD, I will not make a full end with you. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>And it shall come to pass, when ye shall say, Wherefore doeth the LORD our God all these <span class='add'>things</span> unto us? then shalt thou answer them, Like as ye have forsaken me, and served strange gods in your land, so shall ye serve strangers in a land <span class='add'>that is</span> not yours.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>Declare this in the house of Jacob, and publish it in Judah, saying,  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>Hear now this, O foolish people, and without understanding; which have eyes, and see not; which have ears, and hear not:  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>Fear ye not me? saith the LORD: will ye not tremble at my presence, which have placed the sand <span class='add'>for</span> the bound of the sea by a perpetual decree, that it cannot pass it: and though the waves thereof toss themselves, yet can they not prevail; though they roar, yet can they not pass over it?  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>But this people hath a revolting and a rebellious heart; they are revolted and gone.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>Neither say they in their heart, Let us now fear the LORD our God, that giveth rain, both the former and the latter, in his season: he reserveth unto us the appointed weeks of the harvest. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>Your iniquities have turned away these <span class='add'>things</span>, and your sins have withholden good <span class='add'>things</span> from you.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>For among my people are found wicked <span class='add'>men:</span> they lay wait, as he that setteth snares; they set a trap, they catch men.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>As a cage is full of birds, so <span class='add'>are</span> their houses full of deceit: therefore they are become great, and waxen rich.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&nbsp;</span>They are waxen fat, they shine: yea, they overpass the deeds of the wicked: they judge not the cause, the cause of the fatherless, yet they prosper; and the right of the needy do they not judge.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&nbsp;</span>Shall I not visit for these <span class='add'>things?</span> saith the LORD: shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this?
