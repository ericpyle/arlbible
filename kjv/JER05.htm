 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C5V1">&nbsp;</a>Run ye to and fro through the streets of Jerusalem, and see now, and know, and seek in the broad places
thereof, if ye can find a man, if there be
<span class="add">any</span> that executeth judgment, that seeketh the truth; and I will pardon it.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C5V2">&nbsp;</a>And though they say, The LORD liveth; surely they swear falsely.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C5V3">&nbsp;</a>O LORD,
<span class="add">are</span> not thine eyes upon the truth? thou hast stricken them, but they have not grieved; thou hast consumed
them,
<span class="add">but</span> they have refused to receive correction: they have made their faces harder than a rock; they have refused
to return.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C5V4">&nbsp;</a>Therefore I said, Surely these
<span class="add">are</span> poor; they are foolish: for they know not the way of the LORD,
<span class="add">nor</span> the judgment of their God.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C5V5">&nbsp;</a>I will get me unto the great men, and will speak unto them; for they have known the way of the LORD,
<span class="add">and</span> the judgment of their God: but these have altogether broken the yoke,
<span class="add">and</span> burst the bonds.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C5V6">&nbsp;</a>Wherefore a lion out of the forest shall slay them,
<span class="add">and</span> a wolf of the evenings shall spoil them, a leopard shall watch over their cities: every one that goeth
out thence shall be torn in pieces: because their transgressions are many,
<span class="add">and</span> their backslidings are increased.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C5V7">&nbsp;</a>How shall I pardon thee for this? thy children have forsaken me, and sworn by
<span class="add">them that are</span> no gods: when I had fed them to the full, they then committed adultery, and assembled themselves by
troops in the harlots’ houses.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C5V8">&nbsp;</a>They were
<span class="add">as</span> fed horses in the morning: every one neighed after his neighbour’s wife.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C5V9">&nbsp;</a>Shall I not visit for these
<span class="add">things?</span> saith the LORD: and shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this?
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C5V10">&nbsp;</a>Go ye up upon her walls, and destroy; but make not a full end: take away her battlements; for they
<span class="add">are</span> not the LORD’S.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C5V11">&nbsp;</a>For the house of Israel and the house of Judah have dealt very treacherously against me, saith the LORD.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C5V12">&nbsp;</a>They have belied the LORD, and said,
<span class="add">It is</span> not he; neither shall evil come upon us; neither shall we see sword nor famine:
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C5V13">&nbsp;</a>And the prophets shall become wind, and the word
<span class="add">is</span> not in them: thus shall it be done unto them.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C5V14">&nbsp;</a>Wherefore thus saith the LORD God of hosts, Because ye speak this word, behold, I will make my words
in thy mouth fire, and this people wood, and it shall devour them.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C5V15">&nbsp;</a>Lo, I will bring a nation upon you from far, O house of Israel, saith the LORD: it
<span class="add">is</span> a mighty nation, it
<span class="add">is</span> an ancient nation, a nation whose language thou knowest not, neither understandest what they say.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C5V16">&nbsp;</a>Their quiver
<span class="add">is</span> as an open sepulchre, they
<span class="add">are</span> all mighty men.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C5V17">&nbsp;</a>And they shall eat up thine harvest, and thy bread,
<span class="add">which</span> thy sons and thy daughters should eat: they shall eat up thy flocks and thine herds: they shall eat
up thy vines and thy fig trees: they shall impoverish thy fenced cities, wherein thou trustedst, with
the sword.
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C5V18">&nbsp;</a>Nevertheless in those days, saith the LORD, I will not make a full end with you.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C5V19">&nbsp;</a>And it shall come to pass, when ye shall say, Wherefore doeth the LORD our God all these
<span class="add">things</span> unto us? then shalt thou answer them, Like as ye have forsaken me, and served strange gods in your land,
so shall ye serve strangers in a land
<span class="add">that is</span> not yours.
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C5V20">&nbsp;</a>Declare this in the house of Jacob, and publish it in Judah, saying,
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C5V21">&nbsp;</a>Hear now this, O foolish people, and without understanding; which have eyes, and see not; which have
ears, and hear not:
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C5V22">&nbsp;</a>Fear ye not me? saith the LORD: will ye not tremble at my presence, which have placed the sand
<span class="add">for</span> the bound of the sea by a perpetual decree, that it cannot pass it: and though the waves thereof toss
themselves, yet can they not prevail; though they roar, yet can they not pass over it?
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C5V23">&nbsp;</a>But this people hath a revolting and a rebellious heart; they are revolted and gone.
 <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C5V24">&nbsp;</a>Neither say they in their heart, Let us now fear the LORD our God, that giveth rain, both the former
and the latter, in his season: he reserveth unto us the appointed weeks of the harvest.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C5V25">&nbsp;</a>Your iniquities have turned away these
<span class="add">things,</span> and your sins have withholden good
<span class="add">things</span> from you.
 <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C5V26">&nbsp;</a>For among my people are found wicked
<span class="add">men:</span> they lay wait, as he that setteth snares; they set a trap, they catch men.
 <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C5V27">&nbsp;</a>As a cage is full of birds, so
<span class="add">are</span> their houses full of deceit: therefore they are become great, and waxen rich.
 <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C5V28">&nbsp;</a>They are waxen fat, they shine: yea, they overpass the deeds of the wicked: they judge not the cause,
the cause of the fatherless, yet they prosper; and the right of the needy do they not judge.
 <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C5V29">&nbsp;</a>Shall I not visit for these
<span class="add">things?</span> saith the LORD: shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this?
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 30</span><a name="C5V30">&nbsp;</a>A wonderful and horrible thing is committed in the land;
 <span class="verse"> 31</span><a name="C5V31">&nbsp;</a>The prophets prophesy falsely, and the priests bear rule by their means; and my people love
<span class="add">to have it</span> so: and what will ye do in the end thereof?
