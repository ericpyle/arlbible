 <span class="verse" id="V1">1&nbsp;</span> Would to God ye could bear with me a little in <span class='add'>my</span> folly: and indeed bear with me.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span> For I am jealous over you with godly jealousy: for I have espoused you to one husband, that I may present <span class='add'>you as</span> a chaste virgin to Christ.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span> But I fear, lest by any means, as the serpent beguiled Eve through his subtilty, so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span> For if he that cometh preacheth another Jesus, whom we have not preached, or <span class='add'>if</span> ye receive another spirit, which ye have not received, or another gospel, which ye have not accepted, ye might well bear with <span class='add'>him</span>.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span> For I suppose I was not a whit behind the very chiefest apostles.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span> But though <span class='add'>I be</span> rude in speech, yet not in knowledge; but we have been throughly made manifest among you in all things.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span> Have I committed an offence in abasing myself that ye might be exalted, because I have preached to you the gospel of God freely?  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span> I robbed other churches, taking wages <span class='add'>of them</span>, to do you service.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span> And when I was present with you, and wanted, I was chargeable to no man: for that which was lacking to me the brethren which came from Macedonia supplied: and in all <span class='add'>things</span> I have kept myself from being burdensome unto you, and <span class='add'>so</span> will I keep <span class='add'>myself</span>.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span> As the truth of Christ is in me, no man shall stop me of this boasting in the regions of Achaia.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span> Wherefore? because I love you not? God knoweth.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span> But what I do, that I will do, that I may cut off occasion from them which desire occasion; that wherein they glory, they may be found even as we.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span> For such <span class='add'>are</span> false apostles, deceitful workers, transforming themselves into the apostles of Christ.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span> And no marvel; for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span> Therefore <span class='add'>it is</span> no great thing if his ministers also be transformed as the ministers of righteousness; whose end shall be according to their works. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span> I say again, Let no man think me a fool; if otherwise, yet as a fool receive me, that I may boast myself a little.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span> That which I speak, I speak <span class='add'>it</span> not after the Lord, but as it were foolishly, in this confidence of boasting.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span> Seeing that many glory after the flesh, I will glory also.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span> For ye suffer fools gladly, seeing ye <span class='add'>yourselves</span> are wise.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span> For ye suffer, if a man bring you into bondage, if a man devour <span class='add'>you</span>, if a man take <span class='add'>of you</span>, if a man exalt himself, if a man smite you on the face.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span> I speak as concerning reproach, as though we had been weak. Howbeit whereinsoever any is bold, (I speak foolishly,) I am bold also.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span> Are they Hebrews? so <span class='add'>am</span> I. Are they Israelites? so <span class='add'>am</span> I. Are they the seed of Abraham? so <span class='add'>am</span> I.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span> Are they ministers of Christ? (I speak as a fool) I <span class='add'>am</span> more; in labours more abundant, in stripes above measure, in prisons more frequent, in deaths oft.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span> Of the Jews five times received I forty <span class='add'>stripes</span> save one.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span> Thrice was I beaten with rods, once was I stoned, thrice I suffered shipwreck, a night and a day I have been in the deep;  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span> <span class='add'>In</span> journeyings often, <span class='add'>in</span> perils of waters, <span class='add'>in</span> perils of robbers, <span class='add'>in</span> perils by <span class='add'>mine own</span> countrymen, <span class='add'>in</span> perils by the heathen, <span class='add'>in</span> perils in the city, <span class='add'>in</span> perils in the wilderness, <span class='add'>in</span> perils in the sea, <span class='add'>in</span> perils among false brethren;  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span> In weariness and painfulness, in watchings often, in hunger and thirst, in fastings often, in cold and nakedness.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&nbsp;</span> Beside those things that are without, that which cometh upon me daily, the care of all the churches.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&nbsp;</span> Who is weak, and I am not weak? who is offended, and I burn not?  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&nbsp;</span> If I must needs glory, I will glory of the things which concern mine infirmities.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&nbsp;</span> The God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which is blessed for evermore, knoweth that I lie not.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&nbsp;</span> In Damascus the governor under Aretas the king kept the city of the Damascenes with a garrison, desirous to apprehend me:  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&nbsp;</span> And through a window in a basket was I let down by the wall, and escaped his hands. </div><ul class='tnav'>
