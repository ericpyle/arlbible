 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C11V1">&nbsp;</a>Would to God ye could bear with me a little in
<span class="add">my</span> folly: and indeed bear with me.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C11V2">&nbsp;</a>For I am jealous over you with godly jealousy: for I have espoused you to one husband, that I may present
<span class="add">you as</span> a chaste virgin to Christ.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C11V3">&nbsp;</a>But I fear, lest by any means, as the serpent beguiled Eve through his subtilty, so your minds should
be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C11V4">&nbsp;</a>For if he that cometh preacheth another Jesus, whom we have not preached, or
<span class="add">if</span> ye receive another spirit, which ye have not received, or another gospel, which ye have not accepted,
ye might well bear with
<span class="add">him.
</span> <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C11V5">&nbsp;</a>For I suppose I was not a whit behind the very chiefest apostles.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C11V6">&nbsp;</a>But though
<span class="add">I be</span> rude in speech, yet not in knowledge; but we have been throughly made manifest among you in all things.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C11V7">&nbsp;</a>Have I committed an offence in abasing myself that ye might be exalted, because I have preached to you
the gospel of God freely?
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C11V8">&nbsp;</a>I robbed other churches, taking wages
<span class="add">of them,</span> to do you service.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C11V9">&nbsp;</a>And when I was present with you, and wanted, I was chargeable to no man: for that which was lacking to
me the brethren which came from Macedonia supplied: and in all
<span class="add">things</span> I have kept myself from being burdensome unto you, and so will I keep
<span class="add">myself.
</span> <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C11V10">&nbsp;</a>As the truth of Christ is in me, no man shall stop me of this boasting in the regions of Achaia.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C11V11">&nbsp;</a>Wherefore? because I love you not? God knoweth.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C11V12">&nbsp;</a>But what I do, that I will do, that I may cut off occasion from them which desire occasion; that wherein
they glory, they may be found even as we.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C11V13">&nbsp;</a>For such
<span class="add">are</span> false apostles, deceitful workers, transforming themselves into the apostles of Christ.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C11V14">&nbsp;</a>And no marvel; for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C11V15">&nbsp;</a>Therefore
<span class="add">it is</span> no great thing if his ministers also be transformed as the ministers of righteousness; whose end shall
be according to their works.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C11V16">&nbsp;</a>I say again, Let no man think me a fool; if otherwise, yet as a fool receive me, that I may boast myself
a little.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C11V17">&nbsp;</a>That which I speak, I speak
<span class="add">it</span> not after the Lord, but as it were foolishly, in this confidence of boasting.
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C11V18">&nbsp;</a>Seeing that many glory after the flesh, I will glory also.
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C11V19">&nbsp;</a>For ye suffer fools gladly, seeing ye
<span class="add">yourselves</span> are wise.
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C11V20">&nbsp;</a>For ye suffer, if a man bring you into bondage, if a man devour
<span class="add">you,</span> if a man take
<span class="add">of you,</span> if a man exalt himself, if a man smite you on the face.
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C11V21">&nbsp;</a>I speak as concerning reproach, as though we had been weak. Howbeit whereinsoever any is bold, (I speak
foolishly,) I am bold also.
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C11V22">&nbsp;</a>Are they Hebrews? so
<span class="add">am</span> I. Are they Israelites? so
<span class="add">am
</span> I. Are they the seed of Abraham? so
<span class="add">am</span> I.
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C11V23">&nbsp;</a>Are they ministers of Christ? (I speak as a fool) I
<span class="add">am</span> more; in labours more abundant, in stripes above measure, in prisons more frequent, in deaths oft.
 <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C11V24">&nbsp;</a>Of the Jews five times received I forty
<span class="add">stripes</span> save one.
 <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C11V25">&nbsp;</a>Thrice was I beaten with rods, once was I stoned, thrice I suffered shipwreck, a night and a day I have
been in the deep;
 <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C11V26">&nbsp;</a><span class="add">In</span> journeyings often,
<span class="add">in</span> perils of waters,
<span class="add">in</span> perils of robbers,
<span class="add">in</span> perils by
<span class="add">mine own
</span> countrymen,
<span class="add">in</span> perils by the heathen,
<span class="add">in</span> perils in the city,
<span class="add">in</span> perils in the wilderness,
<span class="add">in</span> perils in the sea,
<span class="add">in</span> perils among false brethren;
 <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C11V27">&nbsp;</a>In weariness and painfulness, in watchings often, in hunger and thirst, in fastings often, in cold and
nakedness.
 <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C11V28">&nbsp;</a>Beside those things that are without, that which cometh upon me daily, the care of all the churches.
 <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C11V29">&nbsp;</a>Who is weak, and I am not weak? who is offended, and I burn not?
 <span class="verse"> 30</span><a name="C11V30">&nbsp;</a>If I must needs glory, I will glory of the things which concern mine infirmities.
 <span class="verse"> 31</span><a name="C11V31">&nbsp;</a>The God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which is blessed for evermore, knoweth that I lie not.
 <span class="verse"> 32</span><a name="C11V32">&nbsp;</a>In Damascus the governor under Aretas the king kept the city of the Damascenes with a garrison, desirous
to apprehend me:
 <span class="verse"> 33</span><a name="C11V33">&nbsp;</a>And through a window in a basket was I let down by the wall, and escaped his hands.
