 <span class="verse" id="V1">1&nbsp;</span>I am sought of <span class='add'>them that</span> asked not <span class='add'>for me;</span> I am found of <span class='add'>them that</span> sought me not: I said, Behold me, behold me, unto a nation <span class='add'>that</span> was not called by my name.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span>I have spread out my hands all the day unto a rebellious people, which walketh in a way <span class='add'>that was</span> not good, after their own thoughts;  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>A people that provoketh me to anger continually to my face; that sacrificeth in gardens, and burneth incense upon altars of brick;  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>Which remain among the graves, and lodge in the monuments, which eat swine’s flesh, and broth of abominable <span class='add'>things is in</span> their vessels;  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>Which say, Stand by thyself, come not near to me; for I am holier than thou. <span class='add'>These</span> are a smoke in my nose, a fire that burneth all the day.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>Behold, <span class='add'>it is</span> written before me: I will not keep silence, but will recompense, even recompense into their bosom,  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>Your iniquities, and the iniquities of your fathers together, saith the LORD, which have burned incense upon the mountains, and blasphemed me upon the hills: therefore will I measure their former work into their bosom. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>Thus saith the LORD, As the new wine is found in the cluster, and <span class='add'>one</span> saith, Destroy it not; for a blessing <span class='add'>is</span> in it: so will I do for my servants’ sakes, that I may not destroy them all.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>And I will bring forth a seed out of Jacob, and out of Judah an inheritor of my mountains: and mine elect shall inherit it, and my servants shall dwell there.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>And Sharon shall be a fold of flocks, and the valley of Achor a place for the herds to lie down in, for my people that have sought me. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>But ye <span class='add'>are</span> they that forsake the LORD, that forget my holy mountain, that prepare a table for that troop, and that furnish the drink offering unto that number.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>Therefore will I number you to the sword, and ye shall all bow down to the slaughter: because when I called, ye did not answer; when I spake, ye did not hear; but did evil before mine eyes, and did choose <span class='add'>that</span> wherein I delighted not.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD, Behold, my servants shall eat, but ye shall be hungry: behold, my servants shall drink, but ye shall be thirsty: behold, my servants shall rejoice, but ye shall be ashamed:  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>Behold, my servants shall sing for joy of heart, but ye shall cry for sorrow of heart, and shall howl for vexation of spirit.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>And ye shall leave your name for a curse unto my chosen: for the Lord GOD shall slay thee, and call his servants by another name:  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>That he who blesseth himself in the earth shall bless himself in the God of truth; and he that sweareth in the earth shall swear by the God of truth; because the former troubles are forgotten, and because they are hid from mine eyes. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>For, behold, I create new heavens and a new earth: and the former shall not be remembered, nor come into mind.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>But be ye glad and rejoice for ever <span class='add'>in that</span> which I create: for, behold, I create Jerusalem a rejoicing, and her people a joy.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>And I will rejoice in Jerusalem, and joy in my people: and the voice of weeping shall be no more heard in her, nor the voice of crying.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>There shall be no more thence an infant of days, nor an old man that hath not filled his days: for the child shall die an hundred years old; but the sinner <span class='add'>being</span> an hundred years old shall be accursed.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>And they shall build houses, and inhabit <span class='add'>them;</span> and they shall plant vineyards, and eat the fruit of them.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>They shall not build, and another inhabit; they shall not plant, and another eat: for as the days of a tree <span class='add'>are</span> the days of my people, and mine elect shall long enjoy the work of their hands.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>They shall not labour in vain, nor bring forth for trouble; for they <span class='add'>are</span> the seed of the blessed of the LORD, and their offspring with them.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>And it shall come to pass, that before they call, I will answer; and while they are yet speaking, I will hear.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>The wolf and the lamb shall feed together, and the lion shall eat straw like the bullock: and dust <span class='add'>shall be</span> the serpent’s meat. They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain, saith the LORD. </div><ul class='tnav'>
