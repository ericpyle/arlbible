 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C7V1">&nbsp;</a>And it came to pass in the fourth year of king Darius,
<span class="add">that
</span> the word of the LORD came unto Zechariah in the fourth
<span class="add">day
</span> of the ninth month,
<span class="add">even</span> in Chisleu;
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C7V2">&nbsp;</a>When they had sent unto the house of God Sherezer and Regem-melech, and their men, to pray before the
LORD,
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C7V3">&nbsp;</a><span class="add">And</span> to speak unto the priests which
<span class="add">were</span> in the house of the LORD of hosts, and to the prophets, saying, Should I weep in the fifth month, separating
myself, as I have done these so many years?
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C7V4">&nbsp;</a>Then came the word of the LORD of hosts unto me, saying,
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C7V5">&nbsp;</a>Speak unto all the people of the land, and to the priests, saying, When ye fasted and mourned in the
fifth and seventh
<span class="add">month,</span> even those seventy years, did ye at all fast unto me,
<span class="add">even</span> to me?
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C7V6">&nbsp;</a>And when ye did eat, and when ye did drink, did not ye eat
<span class="add">for yourselves,</span> and drink
<span class="add">for yourselves?
</span> <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C7V7">&nbsp;</a><span class="add">Should ye</span> not
<span class="add">hear</span> the words which the LORD hath cried by the former prophets, when Jerusalem was inhabited and in prosperity,
and the cities thereof round about her, when
<span class="add">men</span> inhabited the south and the plain?
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C7V8">&nbsp;</a>And the word of the LORD came unto Zechariah, saying,
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C7V9">&nbsp;</a>Thus speaketh the LORD of hosts, saying, Execute true judgment, and shew mercy and compassions every
man to his brother:
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C7V10">&nbsp;</a>And oppress not the widow, nor the fatherless, the stranger, nor the poor; and let none of you imagine
evil against his brother in your heart.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C7V11">&nbsp;</a>But they refused to hearken, and pulled away the shoulder, and stopped their ears, that they should not
hear.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C7V12">&nbsp;</a>Yea, they made their hearts
<span class="add">as</span> an adamant stone, lest they should hear the law, and the words which the LORD of hosts hath sent in
his spirit by the former prophets: therefore came a great wrath from the LORD of hosts.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C7V13">&nbsp;</a>Therefore it is come to pass,
<span class="add">that</span> as he cried, and they would not hear; so they cried, and I would not hear, saith the LORD of hosts:
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C7V14">&nbsp;</a>But I scattered them with a whirlwind among all the nations whom they knew not. Thus the land was desolate
after them, that no man passed through nor returned: for they laid the pleasant land desolate.
