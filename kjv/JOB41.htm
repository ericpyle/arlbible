 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C41V1">&nbsp;</a>Canst thou draw out leviathan with an hook? or his tongue with a cord
<span class="add">which</span> thou lettest down?
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C41V2">&nbsp;</a>Canst thou put an hook into his nose? or bore his jaw through with a thorn?
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C41V3">&nbsp;</a>Will he make many supplications unto thee? will he speak soft
<span class="add">words</span> unto thee?
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C41V4">&nbsp;</a>Will he make a covenant with thee? wilt thou take him for a servant for ever?
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C41V5">&nbsp;</a>Wilt thou play with him as
<span class="add">with</span> a bird? or wilt thou bind him for thy maidens?
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C41V6">&nbsp;</a>Shall the companions make a banquet of him? shall they part him among the merchants?
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C41V7">&nbsp;</a>Canst thou fill his skin with barbed irons? or his head with fish spears?
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C41V8">&nbsp;</a>Lay thine hand upon him, remember the battle, do no more.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C41V9">&nbsp;</a>Behold, the hope of him is in vain: shall not
<span class="add">one</span> be cast down even at the sight of him?
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C41V10">&nbsp;</a>None
<span class="add">is so</span> fierce that dare stir him up: who then is able to stand before me?
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C41V11">&nbsp;</a>Who hath prevented me, that I should repay
<span class="add">him? whatsoever is</span> under the whole heaven is mine.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C41V12">&nbsp;</a>I will not conceal his parts, nor his power, nor his comely proportion.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C41V13">&nbsp;</a>Who can discover the face of his garment?
<span class="add">or</span> who can come
<span class="add">to him</span> with his double bridle?
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C41V14">&nbsp;</a>Who can open the doors of his face? his teeth
<span class="add">are</span> terrible round about.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C41V15">&nbsp;</a><span class="add">His</span> scales
<span class="add">are his</span> pride, shut up together
<span class="add">as with</span> a close seal.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C41V16">&nbsp;</a>One is so near to another, that no air can come between them.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C41V17">&nbsp;</a>They are joined one to another, they stick together, that they cannot be sundered.
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C41V18">&nbsp;</a>By his neesings a light doth shine, and his eyes
<span class="add">are</span> like the eyelids of the morning.
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C41V19">&nbsp;</a>Out of his mouth go burning lamps,
<span class="add">and</span> sparks of fire leap out.
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C41V20">&nbsp;</a>Out of his nostrils goeth smoke, as
<span class="add">out</span> of a seething pot or caldron.
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C41V21">&nbsp;</a>His breath kindleth coals, and a flame goeth out of his mouth.
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C41V22">&nbsp;</a>In his neck remaineth strength, and sorrow is turned into joy before him.
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C41V23">&nbsp;</a>The flakes of his flesh are joined together: they are firm in themselves; they cannot be moved.
 <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C41V24">&nbsp;</a>His heart is as firm as a stone; yea, as hard as a piece of the nether
<span class="add">millstone.
</span> <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C41V25">&nbsp;</a>When he raiseth up himself, the mighty are afraid: by reason of breakings they purify themselves.
 <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C41V26">&nbsp;</a>The sword of him that layeth at him cannot hold: the spear, the dart, nor the habergeon.
 <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C41V27">&nbsp;</a>He esteemeth iron as straw,
<span class="add">and</span> brass as rotten wood.
 <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C41V28">&nbsp;</a>The arrow cannot make him flee: slingstones are turned with him into stubble.
 <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C41V29">&nbsp;</a>Darts are counted as stubble: he laugheth at the shaking of a spear.
 <span class="verse"> 30</span><a name="C41V30">&nbsp;</a>Sharp stones
<span class="add">are</span> under him: he spreadeth sharp pointed things upon the mire.
 <span class="verse"> 31</span><a name="C41V31">&nbsp;</a>He maketh the deep to boil like a pot: he maketh the sea like a pot of ointment.
 <span class="verse"> 32</span><a name="C41V32">&nbsp;</a>He maketh a path to shine after him;
<span class="add">one</span> would think the deep
<span class="add">to be</span> hoary.
 <span class="verse"> 33</span><a name="C41V33">&nbsp;</a>Upon earth there is not his like, who is made without fear.
 <span class="verse"> 34</span><a name="C41V34">&nbsp;</a>He beholdeth all high
<span class="add">things:</span> he
<span class="add">is</span> a king over all the children of pride.
