 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C10V1">&nbsp;</a>Israel
<span class="add">is</span> an empty vine, he bringeth forth fruit unto himself: according to the multitude of his fruit he hath
increased the altars; according to the goodness of his land they have made goodly images.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C10V2">&nbsp;</a>Their heart is divided; now shall they be found faulty: he shall break down their altars, he shall spoil
their images.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C10V3">&nbsp;</a>For now they shall say, We have no king, because we feared not the LORD; what then should a king do to
us?
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C10V4">&nbsp;</a>They have spoken words, swearing falsely in making a covenant: thus judgment springeth up as hemlock
in the furrows of the field.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C10V5">&nbsp;</a>The inhabitants of Samaria shall fear because of the calves of Beth-aven: for the people thereof shall
mourn over it, and the priests thereof
<span class="add">that</span> rejoiced on it, for the glory thereof, because it is departed from it.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C10V6">&nbsp;</a>It shall be also carried unto Assyria
<span class="add">for</span> a present to king Jareb: Ephraim shall receive shame, and Israel shall be ashamed of his own counsel.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C10V7">&nbsp;</a><span class="add">As for</span> Samaria, her king is cut off as the foam upon the water.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C10V8">&nbsp;</a>The high places also of Aven, the sin of Israel, shall be destroyed: the thorn and the thistle shall
come up on their altars; and they shall say to the mountains, Cover us; and to the hills, Fall on us.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C10V9">&nbsp;</a>O Israel, thou hast sinned from the days of Gibeah: there they stood: the battle in Gibeah against the
children of iniquity did not overtake them.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C10V10">&nbsp;</a><span class="add">It is</span> in my desire that I should chastise them; and the people shall be gathered against them, when they shall
bind themselves in their two furrows.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C10V11">&nbsp;</a>And Ephraim
<span class="add">is as</span> an heifer
<span class="add">that is</span> taught,
<span class="add">and</span> loveth to tread out
<span class="add">the corn;</span> but I passed over upon her fair neck: I will make Ephraim to ride; Judah shall plow,
<span class="add">and</span> Jacob shall break his clods.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C10V12">&nbsp;</a>Sow to yourselves in righteousness, reap in mercy; break up your fallow ground: for
<span class="add">it is</span> time to seek the LORD, till he come and rain righteousness upon you.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C10V13">&nbsp;</a>Ye have plowed wickedness, ye have reaped iniquity; ye have eaten the fruit of lies: because thou didst
trust in thy way, in the multitude of thy mighty men.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C10V14">&nbsp;</a>Therefore shall a tumult arise among thy people, and all thy fortresses shall be spoiled, as Shalman
spoiled Beth-arbel in the day of battle: the mother was dashed in pieces upon
<span class="add">her</span> children.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C10V15">&nbsp;</a>So shall Bethel do unto you because of your great wickedness: in a morning shall the king of Israel utterly
be cut off.
