 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C6V1">&nbsp;</a>We then,
<span class="add">as</span> workers together
<span class="add">with him,</span> beseech
<span class="add">you</span> also that ye receive not the grace of God in vain.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C6V2">&nbsp;</a>(For he saith, I have heard thee in a time accepted, and in the day of salvation have I succoured thee:
behold, now
<span class="add">is</span> the accepted time; behold, now
<span class="add">is</span> the day of salvation.)
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C6V3">&nbsp;</a>Giving no offence in any thing, that the ministry be not blamed:
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C6V4">&nbsp;</a>But in all
<span class="add">things</span> approving ourselves as the ministers of God, in much patience, in afflictions, in necessities, in distresses,
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C6V5">&nbsp;</a>In stripes, in imprisonments, in tumults, in labours, in watchings, in fastings;
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C6V6">&nbsp;</a>By pureness, by knowledge, by longsuffering, by kindness, by the Holy Ghost, by love unfeigned,
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C6V7">&nbsp;</a>By the word of truth, by the power of God, by the armour of righteousness on the right hand and on the
left,
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C6V8">&nbsp;</a>By honour and dishonour, by evil report and good report: as deceivers, and
<span class="add">yet</span> true;
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C6V9">&nbsp;</a>As unknown, and
<span class="add">yet</span> well known; as dying, and, behold, we live; as chastened, and not killed;
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C6V10">&nbsp;</a>As sorrowful, yet alway rejoicing; as poor, yet making many rich; as having nothing, and
<span class="add">yet</span> possessing all things.

<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C6V11">&nbsp;</a>O
<span class="add">ye</span> Corinthians, our mouth is open unto you, our heart is enlarged.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C6V12">&nbsp;</a>Ye are not straitened in us, but ye are straitened in your own bowels.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C6V13">&nbsp;</a>Now for a recompence in the same, (I speak as unto
<span class="add">my</span> children,) be ye also enlarged.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C6V14">&nbsp;</a>Be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers: for what fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness?
and what communion hath light with darkness?
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C6V15">&nbsp;</a>And what concord hath Christ with Belial? or what part hath he that believeth with an infidel?
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C6V16">&nbsp;</a>And what agreement hath the temple of God with idols? for ye are the temple of the living God; as God
hath said, I will dwell in them, and walk in
<span class="add">them;</span> and I will be their God, and they shall be my people.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C6V17">&nbsp;</a>Wherefore come out from among them, and be ye separate, saith the Lord, and touch not the unclean
<span class="add">thing;</span> and I will receive you,
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C6V18">&nbsp;</a>And will be a Father unto you, and ye shall be my sons and daughters, saith the Lord Almighty.
