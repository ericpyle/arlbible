 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C5V1">&nbsp;</a>And it came to pass, when all the kings of the Amorites, which
<span class="add">were</span> on the side of Jordan westward, and all the kings of the Canaanites, which
<span class="add">were</span> by the sea, heard that the LORD had dried up the waters of Jordan from before the children of Israel,
until we were passed over, that their heart melted, neither was there spirit in them any more, because
of the children of Israel.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C5V2">&nbsp;</a>At that time the LORD said unto Joshua, Make thee sharp knives, and circumcise again the children of
Israel the second time.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C5V3">&nbsp;</a>And Joshua made him sharp knives, and circumcised the children of Israel at the hill of the foreskins.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C5V4">&nbsp;</a>And this
<span class="add">is</span> the cause why Joshua did circumcise: All the people that came out of Egypt,
<span class="add">that were</span> males,
<span class="add">even</span> all the men of war, died in the wilderness by the way, after they came out of Egypt.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C5V5">&nbsp;</a>Now all the people that came out were circumcised: but all the people
<span class="add">that were</span> born in the wilderness by the way as they came forth out of Egypt,
<span class="add">them</span> they had not circumcised.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C5V6">&nbsp;</a>For the children of Israel walked forty years in the wilderness, till all the people
<span class="add">that were</span> men of war, which came out of Egypt, were consumed, because they obeyed not the voice of the LORD: unto
whom the LORD sware that he would not shew them the land, which the LORD sware unto their fathers that
he would give us, a land that floweth with milk and honey.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C5V7">&nbsp;</a>And their children,
<span class="add">whom</span> he raised up in their stead, them Joshua circumcised: for they were uncircumcised, because they had
not circumcised them by the way.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C5V8">&nbsp;</a>And it came to pass, when they had done circumcising all the people, that they abode in their places
in the camp, till they were whole.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C5V9">&nbsp;</a>And the LORD said unto Joshua, This day have I rolled away the reproach of Egypt from off you. Wherefore
the name of the place is called Gilgal unto this day.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C5V10">&nbsp;</a>And the children of Israel encamped in Gilgal, and kept the passover on the fourteenth day of the month
at even in the plains of Jericho.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C5V11">&nbsp;</a>And they did eat of the old corn of the land on the morrow after the passover, unleavened cakes, and
parched
<span class="add">corn</span> in the selfsame day.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C5V12">&nbsp;</a>And the manna ceased on the morrow after they had eaten of the old corn of the land; neither had the
children of Israel manna any more; but they did eat of the fruit of the land of Canaan that year.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C5V13">&nbsp;</a>And it came to pass, when Joshua was by Jericho, that he lifted up his eyes and looked, and, behold,
there stood a man over against him with his sword drawn in his hand: and Joshua went unto him, and said
unto him,
<span class="add">Art</span> thou for us, or for our adversaries?
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C5V14">&nbsp;</a>And he said, Nay; but
<span class="add">as</span> captain of the host of the LORD am I now come. And Joshua fell on his face to the earth, and did worship,
and said unto him, What saith my lord unto his servant?
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C5V15">&nbsp;</a>And the captain of the LORD’S host said unto Joshua, Loose thy shoe from off thy foot; for the place
whereon thou standest
<span class="add">is</span> holy. And Joshua did so.
