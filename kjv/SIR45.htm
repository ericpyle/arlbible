 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C45V1">&nbsp;</a>And he brought out of him a merciful man, which found favour in the sight of all flesh, even Moses, beloved
of God and men, whose memorial is blessed.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C45V2">&nbsp;</a>He made him like to the glorious saints, and magnified him, so that his enemies stood in fear of him.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C45V3">&nbsp;</a>By his words he caused the wonders to cease, and he made him glorious in the sight of kings, and gave
him a commandment for his people, and shewed him part of his glory.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C45V4">&nbsp;</a>He sanctified him in his faithfuless and meekness, and chose him out of all men.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C45V5">&nbsp;</a>He made him to hear his voice, and brought him into the dark cloud, and gave him commandments before
his face, even the law of life and knowledge, that he might teach Jacob his covenants, and Israel his
judgments.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C45V6">&nbsp;</a>He exalted Aaron, an holy man like unto him, even his brother, of the tribe of Levi.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C45V7">&nbsp;</a>An everlasting covenant he made with him and gave him the priesthood among the people; he beautified
him with comely ornaments, and clothed him with a robe of glory.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C45V8">&nbsp;</a>He put upon him perfect glory; and strengthened him with rich garments, with breeches, with a long robe,
and the ephod.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C45V9">&nbsp;</a>And he compassed him with pomegranates, and with many golden bells round about, that as he went there
might be a sound, and a noise made that might be heard in the temple, for a memorial to the children
of his people;
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C45V10">&nbsp;</a>With an holy garment, with gold, and blue silk, and purple, the work of the embroidere, with a breastplate
of judgment, and with Urim and Thummim;
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C45V11">&nbsp;</a>With twisted scarlet, the work of the cunning workman, with precious stones graven like seals, and set
in gold, the work of the jeweller, with a writing engraved for a memorial, after the number of the tribes
of Israel.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C45V12">&nbsp;</a>He set a crown of gold upon the mitre, wherein was engraved Holiness, an ornament of honour, a costly
work, the desires of the eyes, goodly and beautiful.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C45V13">&nbsp;</a>Before him there were none such, neither did ever any stranger put them on, but only his children and
his children’s children perpetually.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C45V14">&nbsp;</a>Their sacrifices shall be wholly consumed every day twice continually.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C45V15">&nbsp;</a>Moses consecrated him, and anointed him with holy oil: this was appointed unto him by an everlasting
covenant, and to his seed, so long as the heavens should remain, that they should minister unto him,
and execute the office of the priesthood, and bless the people in his name.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C45V16">&nbsp;</a>He chose him out of all men living to offer sacrifices to the Lord, incense, and a sweet savour, for
a memorial, to make reconciliation for his people.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C45V17">&nbsp;</a>He gave unto him his commandments, and authority in the statutes of judgments, that he should teach Jacob
the testimonies, and inform Israel in his laws.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C45V18">&nbsp;</a>Strangers conspired together against him, and maligned him in the wilderness, even the men that were
of Dathan’s and Abiron’s side, and the congregation of Core, with fury and wrath.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C45V19">&nbsp;</a>This the Lord saw, and it displeased him, and in his wrathful indignation were they consumed: he did
wonders upon them, to consume them with the fiery flame.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C45V20">&nbsp;</a>But he made Aaron more honourable, and gave him an heritage, and divided unto him the firstfruits of
the increase; especially he prepared bread in abundance:
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C45V21">&nbsp;</a>For they eat of the sacrifices of the Lord, which he gave unto him and his seed.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C45V22">&nbsp;</a>Howbeit in the land of the people he had no inheritance, neither had he any portion among the people:
for the Lord himself is his portion and inheritance.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C45V23">&nbsp;</a>The third in glory is Phinees the son of Eleazar, because he had zeal in the fear of the Lord, and stood
up with good courage of heart: when the people were turned back, and made reconciliation for Israel.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C45V24">&nbsp;</a>Therefore was there a covenant of peace made with him, that he should be the chief of the sanctuary and
of his people, and that he and his posterity should have the dignity of the priesthood for ever:
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C45V25">&nbsp;</a>According to the covenant made with David son of Jesse, of the tribe of Juda, that the inheritance of
the king should be to his posterity alone: so the inheritance of Aaron should also be unto his seed.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C45V26">&nbsp;</a>God give you wisdom in your heart to judge his people in righteousness, that their good things be not
abolished, and that their glory may endure for ever.
