<div class="mt1">The Epistle of Paul to Philemon
</div>
<div class="chapterlabel"> 1</div><div class="p">
 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C1V1">&nbsp;</a>Paul, a prisoner of Jesus Christ, and Timothy our brother, unto Philemon our dearly beloved, and fellowlabourer,
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C1V2">&nbsp;</a>And to
<span class="add">our</span> beloved Apphia, and Archippus our fellowsoldier, and to the church in thy house:
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C1V3">&nbsp;</a>Grace to you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C1V4">&nbsp;</a>I thank my God, making mention of thee always in my prayers,
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C1V5">&nbsp;</a>Hearing of thy love and faith, which thou hast toward the Lord Jesus, and toward all saints;
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C1V6">&nbsp;</a>That the communication of thy faith may become effectual by the acknowledging of every good thing which
is in you in Christ Jesus.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C1V7">&nbsp;</a>For we have great joy and consolation in thy love, because the bowels of the saints are refreshed by
thee, brother.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C1V8">&nbsp;</a>Wherefore, though I might be much bold in Christ to enjoin thee that which is convenient,
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C1V9">&nbsp;</a>Yet for love’s sake I rather beseech
<span class="add">thee,</span> being such an one as Paul the aged, and now also a prisoner of Jesus Christ.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C1V10">&nbsp;</a>I beseech thee for my son Onesimus, whom I have begotten in my bonds:
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C1V11">&nbsp;</a>Which in time past was to thee unprofitable, but now profitable to thee and to me:
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C1V12">&nbsp;</a>Whom I have sent again: thou therefore receive him, that is, mine own bowels:
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C1V13">&nbsp;</a>Whom I would have retained with me, that in thy stead he might have ministered unto me in the bonds of
the gospel:
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C1V14">&nbsp;</a>But without thy mind would I do nothing; that thy benefit should not be as it were of necessity, but
willingly.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C1V15">&nbsp;</a>For perhaps he therefore departed for a season, that thou shouldest receive him for ever;
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C1V16">&nbsp;</a>Not now as a servant, but above a servant, a brother beloved, specially to me, but how much more unto
thee, both in the flesh, and in the Lord?
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C1V17">&nbsp;</a>If thou count me therefore a partner, receive him as myself.
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C1V18">&nbsp;</a>If he hath wronged thee, or oweth
<span class="add">thee</span> ought, put that on mine account;
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C1V19">&nbsp;</a>I Paul have written
<span class="add">it</span> with mine own hand, I will repay
<span class="add">it:</span> albeit I do not say to thee how thou owest unto me even thine own self besides.
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C1V20">&nbsp;</a>Yea, brother, let me have joy of thee in the Lord: refresh my bowels in the Lord.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C1V21">&nbsp;</a>Having confidence in thy obedience I wrote unto thee, knowing that thou wilt also do more than I say.
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C1V22">&nbsp;</a>But withal prepare me also a lodging: for I trust that through your prayers I shall be given unto you.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C1V23">&nbsp;</a>There salute thee Epaphras, my fellowprisoner in Christ Jesus;
 <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C1V24">&nbsp;</a>Marcus, Aristarchus, Demas, Lucas, my fellowlabourers.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C1V25">&nbsp;</a>The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ
<span class="add">be</span> with your spirit. Amen.
