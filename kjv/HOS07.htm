 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C7V1">&nbsp;</a>When I would have healed Israel, then the iniquity of Ephraim was discovered, and the wickedness of Samaria:
for they commit falsehood; and the thief cometh in,
<span class="add">and</span> the troop of robbers spoileth without.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C7V2">&nbsp;</a>And they consider not in their hearts
<span class="add">that</span> I remember all their wickedness: now their own doings have beset them about; they are before my face.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C7V3">&nbsp;</a>They make the king glad with their wickedness, and the princes with their lies.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C7V4">&nbsp;</a>They
<span class="add">are</span> all adulterers, as an oven heated by the baker,
<span class="add">who</span> ceaseth from raising after he hath kneaded the dough, until it be leavened.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C7V5">&nbsp;</a>In the day of our king the princes have made
<span class="add">him</span> sick with bottles of wine; he stretched out his hand with scorners.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C7V6">&nbsp;</a>For they have made ready their heart like an oven, whiles they lie in wait: their baker sleepeth all
the night; in the morning it burneth as a flaming fire.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C7V7">&nbsp;</a>They are all hot as an oven, and have devoured their judges; all their kings are fallen:
<span class="add">there is</span> none among them that calleth unto me.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C7V8">&nbsp;</a>Ephraim, he hath mixed himself among the people; Ephraim is a cake not turned.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C7V9">&nbsp;</a>Strangers have devoured his strength, and he knoweth
<span class="add">it</span> not: yea, gray hairs are here and there upon him, yet he knoweth not.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C7V10">&nbsp;</a>And the pride of Israel testifieth to his face: and they do not return to the LORD their God, nor seek
him for all this.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C7V11">&nbsp;</a>Ephraim also is like a silly dove without heart: they call to Egypt, they go to Assyria.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C7V12">&nbsp;</a>When they shall go, I will spread my net upon them; I will bring them down as the fowls of the heaven;
I will chastise them, as their congregation hath heard.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C7V13">&nbsp;</a>Woe unto them! for they have fled from me: destruction unto them! because they have transgressed against
me: though I have redeemed them, yet they have spoken lies against me.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C7V14">&nbsp;</a>And they have not cried unto me with their heart, when they howled upon their beds: they assemble themselves
for corn and wine,
<span class="add">and</span> they rebel against me.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C7V15">&nbsp;</a>Though I have bound
<span class="add">and</span> strengthened their arms, yet do they imagine mischief against me.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C7V16">&nbsp;</a>They return,
<span class="add">but</span> not to the most High: they are like a deceitful bow: their princes shall fall by the sword for the rage
of their tongue: this
<span class="add">shall be</span> their derision in the land of Egypt.
