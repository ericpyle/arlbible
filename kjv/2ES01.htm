<div class="mt1">The Second Book of Esdras
</div>
<div class="chapterlabel"> 1</div><div class="p">
 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C1V1">&nbsp;</a>The second book of the prophet Esdras, the son of Saraias, the son of Azarias, the son of Helchias, the
son of Sadamias, the son of Sadoc, the son of Achitob,
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C1V2">&nbsp;</a>The son of Achias, the son of Phinees, the son of Heli, the son of Amarias, the son of Aziei, the son
of Marimoth, the son of Arna, the son of Ozias, the son of Borith, the son of Abisei, the son of Phinees,
the son of Eleazar,
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C1V3">&nbsp;</a>The son of Aaron, of the tribe of Levi; which was captive in the land of the Medes, in the reign of Artexerxes
king of the Persians.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C1V4">&nbsp;</a>And the word of the Lord came unto me, saying,
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C1V5">&nbsp;</a>Go thy way, and shew my people their sinful deeds, and their children their wickedness which they have
done against me; that they may tell their children’s children:
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C1V6">&nbsp;</a>Because the sins of their fathers are increased in them: for they have forgotten me, and have offered
unto strange gods.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C1V7">&nbsp;</a>Am not I even he that brought them out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage? but they have
provoked me unto wrath, and despised my counsels.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C1V8">&nbsp;</a>Pull thou off then the hair of thy head, and cast all evil upon them, for they have not been obedient
unto my law, but it is a rebellious people.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C1V9">&nbsp;</a>How long shall I forbear them, into whom I have done so much good?
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C1V10">&nbsp;</a>Many kings have I destroyed for their sakes; Pharaoh with his servants and all his power have I smitten
down.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C1V11">&nbsp;</a>All the nations have I destroyed before them, and in the east I have scattered the people of two provinces,
even of Tyrus and Sidon, and have slain all their enemies.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C1V12">&nbsp;</a>Speak thou therefore unto them, saying, Thus saith the Lord,
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C1V13">&nbsp;</a>I led you through the sea and in the beginning gave you a large and safe passage; I gave you Moses for
a leader, and Aaron for a priest.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C1V14">&nbsp;</a>I gave you light in a pillar of fire, and great wonders have I done among you; yet have ye forgotten
me, saith the Lord.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C1V15">&nbsp;</a>Thus saith the Almighty Lord, The quails were as a token to you; I gave you tents for your safeguard:
nevertheless ye murmured there,
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C1V16">&nbsp;</a>And triumphed not in my name for the destruction of your enemies, but ever to this day do ye yet murmur.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C1V17">&nbsp;</a>Where are the benefits that I have done for you? when ye were hungry and thirsty in the wilderness, did
ye not cry unto me,
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C1V18">&nbsp;</a>Saying, Why hast thou brought us into this wilderness to kill us? it had been better for us to have served
the Egyptians, than to die in this wilderness.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C1V19">&nbsp;</a>Then had I pity upon your mournings, and gave you manna to eat; so ye did eat angels’ bread.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C1V20">&nbsp;</a>When ye were thirsty, did I not cleave the rock, and waters flowed out to your fill? for the heat I covered
you with the leaves of the trees.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C1V21">&nbsp;</a>I divided among you a fruitful land, I cast out the Canaanites, the Pherezites, and the Philistines,
before you: what shall I yet do more for you? saith the Lord.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C1V22">&nbsp;</a>Thus saith the Almighty Lord, When ye were in the wilderness, in the river of the Amorites, being athirst,
and blaspheming my name,
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C1V23">&nbsp;</a>I gave you not fire for your blasphemies, but cast a tree in the water, and made the river sweet.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C1V24">&nbsp;</a>What shall I do unto thee, O Jacob? thou, Juda, wouldest not obey me: I will turn me to other nations,
and unto those will I give my name, that they may keep my statutes.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C1V25">&nbsp;</a>Seeing ye have forsaken me, I will forsake you also; when ye desire me to be gracious unto you, I shall
have no mercy upon you.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C1V26">&nbsp;</a>Whensoever ye shall call upon me, I will not hear you: for ye have defiled your hands with blood, and
your feet are swift to commit manslaughter.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C1V27">&nbsp;</a>Ye have not as it were forsaken me, but your own selves, saith the Lord.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C1V28">&nbsp;</a>Thus saith the Almighty Lord, Have I not prayed you as a father his sons, as a mother her daughters,
and a nurse her young babes,
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C1V29">&nbsp;</a>That ye would be my people, and I should be your God; that ye would be my children, and I should be your
father?
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 30</span><a name="C1V30">&nbsp;</a>I gathered you together, as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings: but now, what shall I do unto
you? I will cast you out from my face.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 31</span><a name="C1V31">&nbsp;</a>When ye offer unto me, I will turn my face from you: for your solemn feastdays, your new moons, and your
circumcisions, have I forsaken.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 32</span><a name="C1V32">&nbsp;</a>I sent unto you my servants the prophets, whom ye have taken and slain, and torn their bodies in pieces,
whose blood I will require of your hands, saith the Lord.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 33</span><a name="C1V33">&nbsp;</a>Thus saith the Almighty Lord, Your house is desolate, I will cast you out as the wind doth stubble.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 34</span><a name="C1V34">&nbsp;</a>And your children shall not be fruitful; for they have despised my commandment, and done the thing that
is an evil before me.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 35</span><a name="C1V35">&nbsp;</a>Your houses will I give to a people that shall come; which not having heard of me yet shall believe me;
to whom I have shewed no signs, yet they shall do that I have commanded them.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 36</span><a name="C1V36">&nbsp;</a>They have seen no prophets, yet they shall call their sins to remembrance, and acknowledge them.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 37</span><a name="C1V37">&nbsp;</a>I take to witness the grace of the people to come, whose little ones rejoice in gladness: and though
they have not seen me with bodily eyes, yet in spirit they believe the thing that I say.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 38</span><a name="C1V38">&nbsp;</a>And now, brother, behold what glory; and see the people that come from the east:
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 39</span><a name="C1V39">&nbsp;</a>Unto whom I will give for leaders, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, Oseas, Amos, and Micheas, Joel, Abdias,
and Jonas,
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 40</span><a name="C1V40">&nbsp;</a>Nahum, and Abacuc, Sophonias, Aggeus, Zachary, and Malachy, which is called also an angel of the Lord.
