 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C2V1">&nbsp;</a>And the third day there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee; and the mother of Jesus was there:
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C2V2">&nbsp;</a>And both Jesus was called, and his disciples, to the marriage.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C2V3">&nbsp;</a>And when they wanted wine, the mother of Jesus saith unto him, They have no wine.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C2V4">&nbsp;</a>Jesus saith unto her,
<span class="wj">Woman, what have I to do with thee? mine hour is not yet come.
</span> <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C2V5">&nbsp;</a>His mother saith unto the servants, Whatsoever he saith unto you, do
<span class="add">it.
</span> <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C2V6">&nbsp;</a>And there were set there six waterpots of stone, after the manner of the purifying of the Jews, containing
two or three firkins apiece.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C2V7">&nbsp;</a>Jesus saith unto them,
<span class="wj">Fill the waterpots with water.</span> And they filled them up to the brim.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C2V8">&nbsp;</a>And he saith unto them,
<span class="wj">Draw out now, and bear unto the governor of the feast.</span> And they bare
<span class="add">it.
</span> <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C2V9">&nbsp;</a>When the ruler of the feast had tasted the water that was made wine, and knew not whence it was: (but
the servants which drew the water knew;) the governor of the feast called the bridegroom,
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C2V10">&nbsp;</a>And saith unto him, Every man at the beginning doth set forth good wine; and when men have well drunk,
then that which is worse:
<span class="add">but</span> thou hast kept the good wine until now.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C2V11">&nbsp;</a>This beginning of miracles did Jesus in Cana of Galilee, and manifested forth his glory; and his disciples
believed on him.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C2V12">&nbsp;</a>After this he went down to Capernaum, he, and his mother, and his brethren, and his disciples: and they
continued there not many days.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C2V13">&nbsp;</a>And the Jews’ passover was at hand, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem,
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C2V14">&nbsp;</a>And found in the temple those that sold oxen and sheep and doves, and the changers of money sitting:
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C2V15">&nbsp;</a>And when he had made a scourge of small cords, he drove them all out of the temple, and the sheep, and
the oxen; and poured out the changers’ money, and overthrew the tables;
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C2V16">&nbsp;</a>And said unto them that sold doves,
<span class="wj">Take these things hence; make not my Father’s house an house of merchandise.
</span> <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C2V17">&nbsp;</a>And his disciples remembered that it was written, The zeal of thine house hath eaten me up.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C2V18">&nbsp;</a>Then answered the Jews and said unto him, What sign shewest thou unto us, seeing that thou doest these
things?
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C2V19">&nbsp;</a>Jesus answered and said unto them,
<span class="wj">Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.
</span> <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C2V20">&nbsp;</a>Then said the Jews, Forty and six years was this temple in building, and wilt thou rear it up in three
days?
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C2V21">&nbsp;</a>But he spake of the temple of his body.
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C2V22">&nbsp;</a>When therefore he was risen from the dead, his disciples remembered that he had said this unto them;
and they believed the scripture, and the word which Jesus had said.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C2V23">&nbsp;</a>Now when he was in Jerusalem at the passover, in the feast
<span class="add">day,</span> many believed in his name, when they saw the miracles which he did.
 <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C2V24">&nbsp;</a>But Jesus did not commit himself unto them, because he knew all
<span class="add">men,
</span> <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C2V25">&nbsp;</a>And needed not that any should testify of man: for he knew what was in man.
