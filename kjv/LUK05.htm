 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C5V1">&nbsp;</a>And it came to pass, that, as the people pressed upon him to hear the word of God, he stood by the lake
of Gennesaret,
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C5V2">&nbsp;</a>And saw two ships standing by the lake: but the fishermen were gone out of them, and were washing
<span class="add">their</span> nets.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C5V3">&nbsp;</a>And he entered into one of the ships, which was Simon’s, and prayed him that he would thrust out a little
from the land. And he sat down, and taught the people out of the ship.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C5V4">&nbsp;</a>Now when he had left speaking, he said unto Simon,
<span class="wj">Launch out into the deep, and let down your nets for a draught.
</span> <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C5V5">&nbsp;</a>And Simon answering said unto him, Master, we have toiled all the night, and have taken nothing: nevertheless
at thy word I will let down the net.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C5V6">&nbsp;</a>And when they had this done, they inclosed a great multitude of fishes: and their net brake.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C5V7">&nbsp;</a>And they beckoned unto
<span class="add">their</span> partners, which were in the other ship, that they should come and help them. And they came, and filled
both the ships, so that they began to sink.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C5V8">&nbsp;</a>When Simon Peter saw
<span class="add">it,</span> he fell down at Jesus’ knees, saying, Depart from me; for I am a sinful man, O Lord.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C5V9">&nbsp;</a>For he was astonished, and all that were with him, at the draught of the fishes which they had taken:
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C5V10">&nbsp;</a>And so
<span class="add">was</span> also James, and John, the sons of Zebedee, which were partners with Simon. And Jesus said unto Simon,
<span class="wj">Fear not; from henceforth thou shalt catch men.
</span> <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C5V11">&nbsp;</a>And when they had brought their ships to land, they forsook all, and followed him.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C5V12">&nbsp;</a>And it came to pass, when he was in a certain city, behold a man full of leprosy: who seeing Jesus fell
on
<span class="add">his</span> face, and besought him, saying, Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst make me clean.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C5V13">&nbsp;</a>And he put forth
<span class="add">his</span> hand, and touched him, saying,
<span class="wj">I will: be thou clean.</span> And immediately the leprosy departed from him.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C5V14">&nbsp;</a>And he charged him to tell no man:
<span class="wj">but go, and shew thyself to the priest, and offer for thy cleansing, according as Moses commanded, for
a testimony unto them.
</span> <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C5V15">&nbsp;</a>But so much the more went there a fame abroad of him: and great multitudes came together to hear, and
to be healed by him of their infirmities.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C5V16">&nbsp;</a>And he withdrew himself into the wilderness, and prayed.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C5V17">&nbsp;</a>And it came to pass on a certain day, as he was teaching, that there were Pharisees and doctors of the
law sitting by, which were come out of every town of Galilee, and Judaea, and Jerusalem: and the power
of the Lord was
<span class="add">present</span> to heal them.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C5V18">&nbsp;</a>And, behold, men brought in a bed a man which was taken with a palsy: and they sought
<span class="add">means</span> to bring him in, and to lay
<span class="add">him
</span> before him.
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C5V19">&nbsp;</a>And when they could not find by what
<span class="add">way</span> they might bring him in because of the multitude, they went upon the housetop, and let him down through
the tiling with
<span class="add">his</span> couch into the midst before Jesus.
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C5V20">&nbsp;</a>And when he saw their faith, he said unto him,
<span class="wj">Man, thy sins are forgiven thee.
</span> <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C5V21">&nbsp;</a>And the scribes and the Pharisees began to reason, saying, Who is this which speaketh blasphemies? Who
can forgive sins, but God alone?
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C5V22">&nbsp;</a>But when Jesus perceived their thoughts, he answering said unto them,
<span class="wj">What reason ye in your hearts?
</span> <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C5V23">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Whether is easier, to say, Thy sins be forgiven thee; or to say, Rise up and walk?
</span> <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C5V24">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">But that ye may know that the Son of man hath power upon earth to forgive sins,</span> (he said unto the sick of the palsy,)
<span class="wj">I say unto thee, Arise, and take up thy couch, and go into thine house.
</span> <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C5V25">&nbsp;</a>And immediately he rose up before them, and took up that whereon he lay, and departed to his own house,
glorifying God.
 <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C5V26">&nbsp;</a>And they were all amazed, and they glorified God, and were filled with fear, saying, We have seen strange
things to day.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C5V27">&nbsp;</a>And after these things he went forth, and saw a publican, named Levi, sitting at the receipt of custom:
and he said unto him,
<span class="wj">Follow me.
</span> <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C5V28">&nbsp;</a>And he left all, rose up, and followed him.
 <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C5V29">&nbsp;</a>And Levi made him a great feast in his own house: and there was a great company of publicans and of others
that sat down with them.
 <span class="verse"> 30</span><a name="C5V30">&nbsp;</a>But their scribes and Pharisees murmured against his disciples, saying, Why do ye eat and drink with
publicans and sinners?
 <span class="verse"> 31</span><a name="C5V31">&nbsp;</a>And Jesus answering said unto them,
<span class="wj">They that are whole need not a physician; but they that are sick.
</span> <span class="verse"> 32</span><a name="C5V32">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.
</span></div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 33</span><a name="C5V33">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And they said unto him, Why do the disciples of John fast often, and make prayers, and likewise
</span><span class="add">the disciples</span><span class="wj"> of the Pharisees; but thine eat and drink?
</span> <span class="verse"> 34</span><a name="C5V34">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And he said unto them, Can ye make the children of the bridechamber fast, while the bridegroom is with
them?
</span> <span class="verse"> 35</span><a name="C5V35">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">But the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them, and then shall they fast in
those days.</span></div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 36</span><a name="C5V36">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And he spake also a parable unto them; No man putteth a piece of a new garment upon an old; if otherwise,
then both the new maketh a rent, and the piece that was
</span><span class="add">taken</span><span class="wj"> out of the new agreeth not with the old.
</span> <span class="verse"> 37</span><a name="C5V37">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And no man putteth new wine into old bottles; else the new wine will burst the bottles, and be spilled,
and the bottles shall perish.
</span> <span class="verse"> 38</span><a name="C5V38">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">But new wine must be put into new bottles; and both are preserved.
</span> <span class="verse"> 39</span><a name="C5V39">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">No man also having drunk old
</span><span class="add">wine</span><span class="wj"> straightway desireth new: for he saith, The old is better.</span></div>
