 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C8V1">&nbsp;</a>Wisdom reacheth from one end to another mightily: and sweetly doth she order all things.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C8V2">&nbsp;</a>I loved her, and sought her out from my youth, I desired to make her my spouse, and I was a lover of
her beauty.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C8V3">&nbsp;</a>In that she is conversant with God, she magnifieth her nobility: yea, the Lord of all things himself
loved her.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C8V4">&nbsp;</a>For she is privy to the mysteries of the knowledge of God, and a lover of his works.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C8V5">&nbsp;</a>If riches be a possession to be desired in this life; what is richer than wisdom, that worketh all things?
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C8V6">&nbsp;</a>And if prudence work; who of all that are is a more cunning workman than she?
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C8V7">&nbsp;</a>And if a man love righteousness her labours are virtues: for she teacheth temperance and prudence, justice
and fortitude: which are such things, as en can have nothing more profitable in their life.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C8V8">&nbsp;</a>If a man desire much experience, she knoweth things of old, and conjectureth aright what is to come:
she knoweth the subtilties of speeches, and can expound dark sentences: she foreseeth signs and wonders,
and the events of seasons and times.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C8V9">&nbsp;</a>Therefore I purposed to take her to me to live with me, knowing that she would be a counsellor of good
things, and a comfort in cares and grief.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C8V10">&nbsp;</a>For her sake I shall have estimation among the multitude, and honour with the elders, though I be young.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C8V11">&nbsp;</a>I shall be found of a quick conceit in judgment, and shall be admired in the sight of great men.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C8V12">&nbsp;</a>When I hold my tongue, they shall bide my leisure, and when I speak, they shall give good ear unto me:
if I talk much, they shall lay their hands upon their mouth.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C8V13">&nbsp;</a>Moreover by the means of her I shall obtain immortality, and leave behind me an everlasting memorial
to them that come after me.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C8V14">&nbsp;</a>I shall set the people in order, and the nations shall be subject unto me.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C8V15">&nbsp;</a>Horrible tyrants shall be afraid, when they do but hear of me; I shall be found good among the multitude,
and valiant in war.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C8V16">&nbsp;</a>After I am come into mine house, I will repose myself with her: for her conversation hath no bitterness;
and to live with her hath no sorrow, but mirth and joy.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C8V17">&nbsp;</a>Now when I considered these things in myself, and pondered them in my heart, how that to be allied unto
wisdom is immortality;
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C8V18">&nbsp;</a>And great pleasure it is to have her friendship; and in the works of her hands are infinite riches; and
in the exercise of conference with her, prudence; and in talking with her, a good report; I went about
seeking how to take her to me.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C8V19">&nbsp;</a>For I was a witty child, and had a good spirit.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C8V20">&nbsp;</a>Yea rather, being good, I came into a body undefiled.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C8V21">&nbsp;</a>Nevertheless, when I perceived that I could not otherwise obtain her, except God gave her me; and that
