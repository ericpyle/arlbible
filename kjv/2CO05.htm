<div class="chapterlabel"> 5</div><div class="p">
 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C5V1">&nbsp;</a>For we know that if our earthly house of
<span class="add">this</span> tabernacle were dissolved, we have a building of God, an house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C5V2">&nbsp;</a>For in this we groan, earnestly desiring to be clothed upon with our house which is from heaven:
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C5V3">&nbsp;</a>If so be that being clothed we shall not be found naked.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C5V4">&nbsp;</a>For we that are in
<span class="add">this</span> tabernacle do groan, being burdened: not for that we would be unclothed, but clothed upon, that mortality
might be swallowed up of life.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C5V5">&nbsp;</a>Now he that hath wrought us for the selfsame thing
<span class="add">is</span> God, who also hath given unto us the earnest of the Spirit.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C5V6">&nbsp;</a>Therefore
<span class="add">we are</span> always confident, knowing that, whilst we are at home in the body, we are absent from the Lord:
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C5V7">&nbsp;</a>(For we walk by faith, not by sight:)
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C5V8">&nbsp;</a>We are confident,
<span class="add">I say,</span> and willing rather to be absent from the body, and to be present with the Lord.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C5V9">&nbsp;</a>Wherefore we labour, that, whether present or absent, we may be accepted of him.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C5V10">&nbsp;</a>For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ; that every one may receive the things
<span class="add">done</span> in
<span class="add">his</span> body, according to that he hath done, whether
<span class="add">it be</span> good or bad.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C5V11">&nbsp;</a>Knowing therefore the terror of the Lord, we persuade men; but we are made manifest unto God; and I trust
also are made manifest in your consciences.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C5V12">&nbsp;</a>For we commend not ourselves again unto you, but give you occasion to glory on our behalf, that ye may
have somewhat to
<span class="add">answer</span> them which glory in appearance, and not in heart.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C5V13">&nbsp;</a>For whether we be beside ourselves,
<span class="add">it is</span> to God: or whether we be sober,
<span class="add">it is</span> for your cause.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C5V14">&nbsp;</a>For the love of Christ constraineth us; because we thus judge, that if one died for all, then were all
dead:
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C5V15">&nbsp;</a>And
<span class="add">that</span> he died for all, that they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves, but unto him which
died for them, and rose again.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C5V16">&nbsp;</a>Wherefore henceforth know we no man after the flesh: yea, though we have known Christ after the flesh,
yet now henceforth know we
<span class="add">him</span> no more.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C5V17">&nbsp;</a>Therefore if any man
<span class="add">be</span> in Christ,
<span class="add">he is</span> a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new.
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C5V18">&nbsp;</a>And all things
<span class="add">are</span> of God, who hath reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ, and hath given to us the ministry of reconciliation;
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C5V19">&nbsp;</a>To wit, that God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing their trespasses unto
them; and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation.
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C5V20">&nbsp;</a>Now then we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God did beseech
<span class="add">you</span> by us: we pray
<span class="add">you</span> in Christ’s stead, be ye reconciled to God.
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C5V21">&nbsp;</a>For he hath made him
<span class="add">to be</span> sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him.
