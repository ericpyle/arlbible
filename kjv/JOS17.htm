 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C17V1">&nbsp;</a>There was also a lot for the tribe of Manasseh; for he
<span class="add">was
</span> the firstborn of Joseph;
<span class="add">to wit,</span> for Machir the firstborn of Manasseh, the father of Gilead: because he was a man of war, therefore he
had Gilead and Bashan.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C17V2">&nbsp;</a>There was also
<span class="add">a lot</span> for the rest of the children of Manasseh by their families; for the children of Abiezer, and for the
children of Helek, and for the children of Asriel, and for the children of Shechem, and for the children
of Hepher, and for the children of Shemida: these
<span class="add">were
</span> the male children of Manasseh the son of Joseph by their families.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C17V3">&nbsp;</a>But Zelophehad, the son of Hepher, the son of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, had no
sons, but daughters: and these
<span class="add">are
</span> the names of his daughters, Mahlah, and Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C17V4">&nbsp;</a>And they came near before Eleazar the priest, and before Joshua the son of Nun, and before the princes,
saying, The LORD commanded Moses to give us an inheritance among our brethren. Therefore according to
the commandment of the LORD he gave them an inheritance among the brethren of their father.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C17V5">&nbsp;</a>And there fell ten portions to Manasseh, beside the land of Gilead and Bashan, which
<span class="add">were</span> on the other side Jordan;
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C17V6">&nbsp;</a>Because the daughters of Manasseh had an inheritance among his sons: and the rest of Manasseh’s sons
had the land of Gilead.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C17V7">&nbsp;</a>And the coast of Manasseh was from Asher to Michmethah, that
<span class="add">lieth
</span> before Shechem; and the border went along on the right hand unto the inhabitants of En- tappuah.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C17V8">&nbsp;</a><span class="add">Now</span> Manasseh had the land of Tappuah: but Tappuah on the border of Manasseh
<span class="add">belonged</span> to the children of Ephraim;
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C17V9">&nbsp;</a>And the coast descended unto the river Kanah, southward of the river: these cities of Ephraim
<span class="add">are</span> among the cities of Manasseh: the coast of Manasseh also
<span class="add">was</span> on the north side of the river, and the outgoings of it were at the sea:
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C17V10">&nbsp;</a>Southward
<span class="add">it was</span> Ephraim’s, and northward
<span class="add">it was
</span> Manasseh’s, and the sea is his border; and they met together in Asher on the north, and in Issachar
on the east.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C17V11">&nbsp;</a>And Manasseh had in Issachar and in Asher Beth-shean and her towns, and Ibleam and her towns, and the
inhabitants of Dor and her towns, and the inhabitants of Endor and her towns, and the inhabitants of
Taanach and her towns, and the inhabitants of Megiddo and her towns,
<span class="add">even</span> three countries.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C17V12">&nbsp;</a>Yet the children of Manasseh could not drive out
<span class="add">the inhabitants of</span> those cities; but the Canaanites would dwell in that land.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C17V13">&nbsp;</a>Yet it came to pass, when the children of Israel were waxen strong, that they put the Canaanites to tribute;
but did not utterly drive them out.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C17V14">&nbsp;</a>And the children of Joseph spake unto Joshua, saying, Why hast thou given me
<span class="add">but</span> one lot and one portion to inherit, seeing I
<span class="add">am</span> a great people, forasmuch as the LORD hath blessed me hitherto?
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C17V15">&nbsp;</a>And Joshua answered them, If thou
<span class="add">be</span> a great people,
<span class="add">then</span> get thee up to the wood
<span class="add">country,</span> and cut down for thyself there in the land of the Perizzites and of the giants, if mount Ephraim be
too narrow for thee.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C17V16">&nbsp;</a>And the children of Joseph said, The hill is not enough for us: and all the Canaanites that dwell in
the land of the valley have chariots of iron,
<span class="add">both they</span> who
<span class="add">are</span> of Beth-shean and her towns, and
<span class="add">they</span> who
<span class="add">are</span> of the valley of Jezreel.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C17V17">&nbsp;</a>And Joshua spake unto the house of Joseph,
<span class="add">even</span> to Ephraim and to Manasseh, saying, Thou
<span class="add">art</span> a great people, and hast great power: thou shalt not have one lot
<span class="add">only:
</span> <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C17V18">&nbsp;</a>But the mountain shall be thine; for it
<span class="add">is</span> a wood, and thou shalt cut it down: and the outgoings of it shall be thine: for thou shalt drive out
the Canaanites, though they have iron chariots,
<span class="add">and</span> though they
<span class="add">be</span> strong.
