 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C15V1">&nbsp;</a>Now in the eighteenth year of king Jeroboam the son of Nebat reigned Abijam over Judah.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C15V2">&nbsp;</a>Three years reigned he in Jerusalem. And his mother’s name
<span class="add">was</span> Maachah, the daughter of Abishalom.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C15V3">&nbsp;</a>And he walked in all the sins of his father, which he had done before him: and his heart was not perfect
with the LORD his God, as the heart of David his father.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C15V4">&nbsp;</a>Nevertheless for David’s sake did the LORD his God give him a lamp in Jerusalem, to set up his son after
him, and to establish Jerusalem:
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C15V5">&nbsp;</a>Because David did
<span class="add">that which was</span> right in the eyes of the LORD, and turned not aside from any
<span class="add">thing</span> that he commanded him all the days of his life, save only in the matter of Uriah the Hittite.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C15V6">&nbsp;</a>And there was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all the days of his life.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C15V7">&nbsp;</a>Now the rest of the acts of Abijam, and all that he did,
<span class="add">are</span> they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? And there was war between Abijam
and Jeroboam.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C15V8">&nbsp;</a>And Abijam slept with his fathers; and they buried him in the city of David: and Asa his son reigned
in his stead.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C15V9">&nbsp;</a>And in the twentieth year of Jeroboam king of Israel reigned Asa over Judah.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C15V10">&nbsp;</a>And forty and one years reigned he in Jerusalem. And his mother’s name
<span class="add">was</span> Maachah, the daughter of Abishalom.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C15V11">&nbsp;</a>And Asa did
<span class="add">that which was</span> right in the eyes of the LORD, as
<span class="add">did</span> David his father.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C15V12">&nbsp;</a>And he took away the sodomites out of the land, and removed all the idols that his fathers had made.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C15V13">&nbsp;</a>And also Maachah his mother, even her he removed from
<span class="add">being</span> queen, because she had made an idol in a grove; and Asa destroyed her idol, and burnt
<span class="add">it</span> by the brook Kidron.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C15V14">&nbsp;</a>But the high places were not removed: nevertheless Asa’s heart was perfect with the LORD all his days.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C15V15">&nbsp;</a>And he brought in the things which his father had dedicated, and the things which himself had dedicated,
into the house of the LORD, silver, and gold, and vessels.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C15V16">&nbsp;</a>And there was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel all their days.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C15V17">&nbsp;</a>And Baasha king of Israel went up against Judah, and built Ramah, that he might not suffer any to go
out or come in to Asa king of Judah.
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C15V18">&nbsp;</a>Then Asa took all the silver and the gold
<span class="add">that were</span> left in the treasures of the house of the LORD, and the treasures of the king’s house, and delivered
them into the hand of his servants: and king Asa sent them to Ben-hadad, the son of Tabrimon, the son
of Hezion, king of Syria, that dwelt at Damascus, saying,
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C15V19">&nbsp;</a><span class="add">There is</span> a league between me and thee,
<span class="add">and</span> between my father and thy father: behold, I have sent unto thee a present of silver and gold; come and
break thy league with Baasha king of Israel, that he may depart from me.
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C15V20">&nbsp;</a>So Ben-hadad hearkened unto king Asa, and sent the captains of the hosts which he had against the cities
of Israel, and smote Ijon, and Dan, and Abel-beth-maachah, and all Cinneroth, with all the land of Naphtali.
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C15V21">&nbsp;</a>And it came to pass, when Baasha heard
<span class="add">thereof,</span> that he left off building of Ramah, and dwelt in Tirzah.
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C15V22">&nbsp;</a>Then king Asa made a proclamation throughout all Judah; none
<span class="add">was</span> exempted: and they took away the stones of Ramah, and the timber thereof, wherewith Baasha had builded;
and king Asa built with them Geba of Benjamin, and Mizpah.
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C15V23">&nbsp;</a>The rest of all the acts of Asa, and all his might, and all that he did, and the cities which he built,
<span class="add">are</span> they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? Nevertheless in the time of his
old age he was diseased in his feet.
 <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C15V24">&nbsp;</a>And Asa slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David his father: and
Jehoshaphat his son reigned in his stead.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C15V25">&nbsp;</a>And Nadab the son of Jeroboam began to reign over Israel in the second year of Asa king of Judah, and
reigned over Israel two years.
 <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C15V26">&nbsp;</a>And he did evil in the sight of the LORD, and walked in the way of his father, and in his sin wherewith
he made Israel to sin.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C15V27">&nbsp;</a>And Baasha the son of Ahijah, of the house of Issachar, conspired against him; and Baasha smote him at
Gibbethon, which
<span class="add">belonged</span> to the Philistines; for Nadab and all Israel laid siege to Gibbethon.
 <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C15V28">&nbsp;</a>Even in the third year of Asa king of Judah did Baasha slay him, and reigned in his stead.
 <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C15V29">&nbsp;</a>And it came to pass, when he reigned,
<span class="add">that</span> he smote all the house of Jeroboam; he left not to Jeroboam any that breathed, until he had destroyed
him, according unto the saying of the LORD, which he spake by his servant Ahijah the Shilonite:
 <span class="verse"> 30</span><a name="C15V30">&nbsp;</a>Because of the sins of Jeroboam which he sinned, and which he made Israel sin, by his provocation wherewith
he provoked the LORD God of Israel to anger.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 31</span><a name="C15V31">&nbsp;</a>Now the rest of the acts of Nadab, and all that he did,
<span class="add">are</span> they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
 <span class="verse"> 32</span><a name="C15V32">&nbsp;</a>And there was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel all their days.
 <span class="verse"> 33</span><a name="C15V33">&nbsp;</a>In the third year of Asa king of Judah began Baasha the son of Ahijah to reign over all Israel in Tirzah,
twenty and four years.
 <span class="verse"> 34</span><a name="C15V34">&nbsp;</a>And he did evil in the sight of the LORD, and walked in the way of Jeroboam, and in his sin wherewith
he made Israel to sin.
