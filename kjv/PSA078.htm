 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C78V1">&nbsp;</a>Give ear, O my people,
<span class="add">to</span> my law: incline your ears to the words of my mouth.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C78V2">&nbsp;</a>I will open my mouth in a parable: I will utter dark sayings of old:
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C78V3">&nbsp;</a>Which we have heard and known, and our fathers have told us.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C78V4">&nbsp;</a>We will not hide
<span class="add">them</span> from their children, shewing to the generation to come the praises of the LORD, and his strength, and
his wonderful works that he hath done.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C78V5">&nbsp;</a>For he established a testimony in Jacob, and appointed a law in Israel, which he commanded our fathers,
that they should make them known to their children:
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C78V6">&nbsp;</a>That the generation to come might know
<span class="add">them, even</span> the children
<span class="add">which</span> should be born;
<span class="add">who</span> should arise and declare
<span class="add">them</span> to their children:
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C78V7">&nbsp;</a>That they might set their hope in God, and not forget the works of God, but keep his commandments:
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C78V8">&nbsp;</a>And might not be as their fathers, a stubborn and rebellious generation; a generation
<span class="add">that</span> set not their heart aright, and whose spirit was not stedfast with God.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C78V9">&nbsp;</a>The children of Ephraim,
<span class="add">being</span> armed,
<span class="add">and</span> carrying bows, turned back in the day of battle.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C78V10">&nbsp;</a>They kept not the covenant of God, and refused to walk in his law;
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C78V11">&nbsp;</a>And forgat his works, and his wonders that he had shewed them.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C78V12">&nbsp;</a>Marvellous things did he in the sight of their fathers, in the land of Egypt,
<span class="add">in</span> the field of Zoan.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C78V13">&nbsp;</a>He divided the sea, and caused them to pass through; and he made the waters to stand as an heap.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C78V14">&nbsp;</a>In the daytime also he led them with a cloud, and all the night with a light of fire.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C78V15">&nbsp;</a>He clave the rocks in the wilderness, and gave
<span class="add">them</span> drink as
<span class="add">out of</span> the great depths.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C78V16">&nbsp;</a>He brought streams also out of the rock, and caused waters to run down like rivers.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C78V17">&nbsp;</a>And they sinned yet more against him by provoking the most High in the wilderness.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C78V18">&nbsp;</a>And they tempted God in their heart by asking meat for their lust.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C78V19">&nbsp;</a>Yea, they spake against God; they said, Can God furnish a table in the wilderness?
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C78V20">&nbsp;</a>Behold, he smote the rock, that the waters gushed out, and the streams overflowed; can he give bread
also? can he provide flesh for his people?
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C78V21">&nbsp;</a>Therefore the LORD heard
<span class="add">this,</span> and was wroth: so a fire was kindled against Jacob, and anger also came up against Israel;
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C78V22">&nbsp;</a>Because they believed not in God, and trusted not in his salvation:
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C78V23">&nbsp;</a>Though he had commanded the clouds from above, and opened the doors of heaven,
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C78V24">&nbsp;</a>And had rained down manna upon them to eat, and had given them of the corn of heaven.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C78V25">&nbsp;</a>Man did eat angels’ food: he sent them meat to the full.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C78V26">&nbsp;</a>He caused an east wind to blow in the heaven: and by his power he brought in the south wind.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C78V27">&nbsp;</a>He rained flesh also upon them as dust, and feathered fowls like as the sand of the sea:
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C78V28">&nbsp;</a>And he let
<span class="add">it</span> fall in the midst of their camp, round about their habitations.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C78V29">&nbsp;</a>So they did eat, and were well filled: for he gave them their own desire;
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 30</span><a name="C78V30">&nbsp;</a>They were not estranged from their lust. But while their meat
<span class="add">was</span> yet in their mouths,
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 31</span><a name="C78V31">&nbsp;</a>The wrath of God came upon them, and slew the fattest of them, and smote down the chosen
<span class="add">men</span> of Israel.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 32</span><a name="C78V32">&nbsp;</a>For all this they sinned still, and believed not for his wondrous works.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 33</span><a name="C78V33">&nbsp;</a>Therefore their days did he consume in vanity, and their years in trouble.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 34</span><a name="C78V34">&nbsp;</a>When he slew them, then they sought him: and they returned and enquired early after God.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 35</span><a name="C78V35">&nbsp;</a>And they remembered that God
<span class="add">was</span> their rock, and the high God their redeemer.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 36</span><a name="C78V36">&nbsp;</a>Nevertheless they did flatter him with their mouth, and they lied unto him with their tongues.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 37</span><a name="C78V37">&nbsp;</a>For their heart was not right with him, neither were they stedfast in his covenant.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 38</span><a name="C78V38">&nbsp;</a>But he,
<span class="add">being</span> full of compassion, forgave
<span class="add">their</span> iniquity, and destroyed
<span class="add">them</span> not: yea, many a time turned he his anger away, and did not stir up all his wrath.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 39</span><a name="C78V39">&nbsp;</a>For he remembered that they
<span class="add">were but</span> flesh; a wind that passeth away, and cometh not again.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 40</span><a name="C78V40">&nbsp;</a>How oft did they provoke him in the wilderness,
<span class="add">and</span> grieve him in the desert!
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 41</span><a name="C78V41">&nbsp;</a>Yea, they turned back and tempted God, and limited the Holy One of Israel.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 42</span><a name="C78V42">&nbsp;</a>They remembered not his hand,
<span class="add">nor</span> the day when he delivered them from the enemy.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 43</span><a name="C78V43">&nbsp;</a>How he had wrought his signs in Egypt, and his wonders in the field of Zoan:
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 44</span><a name="C78V44">&nbsp;</a>And had turned their rivers into blood; and their floods, that they could not drink.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 45</span><a name="C78V45">&nbsp;</a>He sent divers sorts of flies among them, which devoured them; and frogs, which destroyed them.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 46</span><a name="C78V46">&nbsp;</a>He gave also their increase unto the caterpiller, and their labour unto the locust.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 47</span><a name="C78V47">&nbsp;</a>He destroyed their vines with hail, and their sycomore trees with frost.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 48</span><a name="C78V48">&nbsp;</a>He gave up their cattle also to the hail, and their flocks to hot thunderbolts.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 49</span><a name="C78V49">&nbsp;</a>He cast upon them the fierceness of his anger, wrath, and indignation, and trouble, by sending evil angels
<span class="add">among them.</span></div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 50</span><a name="C78V50">&nbsp;</a>He made a way to his anger; he spared not their soul from death, but gave their life over to the pestilence;
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 51</span><a name="C78V51">&nbsp;</a>And smote all the firstborn in Egypt; the chief of
<span class="add">their</span> strength in the tabernacles of Ham:
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 52</span><a name="C78V52">&nbsp;</a>But made his own people to go forth like sheep, and guided them in the wilderness like a flock.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 53</span><a name="C78V53">&nbsp;</a>And he led them on safely, so that they feared not: but the sea overwhelmed their enemies.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 54</span><a name="C78V54">&nbsp;</a>And he brought them to the border of his sanctuary,
<span class="add">even to</span> this mountain,
<span class="add">which</span> his right hand had purchased.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 55</span><a name="C78V55">&nbsp;</a>He cast out the heathen also before them, and divided them an inheritance by line, and made the tribes
of Israel to dwell in their tents.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 56</span><a name="C78V56">&nbsp;</a>Yet they tempted and provoked the most high God, and kept not his testimonies:
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 57</span><a name="C78V57">&nbsp;</a>But turned back, and dealt unfaithfully like their fathers: they were turned aside like a deceitful bow.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 58</span><a name="C78V58">&nbsp;</a>For they provoked him to anger with their high places, and moved him to jealousy with their graven images.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 59</span><a name="C78V59">&nbsp;</a>When God heard
<span class="add">this,</span> he was wroth, and greatly abhorred Israel:
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 60</span><a name="C78V60">&nbsp;</a>So that he forsook the tabernacle of Shiloh, the tent
<span class="add">which</span> he placed among men;
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 61</span><a name="C78V61">&nbsp;</a>And delivered his strength into captivity, and his glory into the enemy’s hand.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 62</span><a name="C78V62">&nbsp;</a>He gave his people over also unto the sword; and was wroth with his inheritance.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 63</span><a name="C78V63">&nbsp;</a>The fire consumed their young men; and their maidens were not given to marriage.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 64</span><a name="C78V64">&nbsp;</a>Their priests fell by the sword; and their widows made no lamentation.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 65</span><a name="C78V65">&nbsp;</a>Then the Lord awaked as one out of sleep,
<span class="add">and</span> like a mighty man that shouteth by reason of wine.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 66</span><a name="C78V66">&nbsp;</a>And he smote his enemies in the hinder parts: he put them to a perpetual reproach.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 67</span><a name="C78V67">&nbsp;</a>Moreover he refused the tabernacle of Joseph, and chose not the tribe of Ephraim:
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 68</span><a name="C78V68">&nbsp;</a>But chose the tribe of Judah, the mount Zion which he loved.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 69</span><a name="C78V69">&nbsp;</a>And he built his sanctuary like high
<span class="add">palaces,</span> like the earth which he hath established for ever.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 70</span><a name="C78V70">&nbsp;</a>He chose David also his servant, and took him from the sheepfolds:
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 71</span><a name="C78V71">&nbsp;</a>From following the ewes great with young he brought him to feed Jacob his people, and Israel his inheritance.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 72</span><a name="C78V72">&nbsp;</a>So he fed them according to the integrity of his heart; and guided them by the skilfulness of his hands.
