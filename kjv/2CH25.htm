<div class="chapterlabel"> 25</div><div class="p">
 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C25V1">&nbsp;</a>Amaziah
<span class="add">was</span> twenty and five years old
<span class="add">when</span> he began to reign, and he reigned twenty and nine years in Jerusalem. And his mother’s name
<span class="add">was</span> Jehoaddan of Jerusalem.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C25V2">&nbsp;</a>And he did
<span class="add">that which was</span> right in the sight of the LORD, but not with a perfect heart.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C25V3">&nbsp;</a>Now it came to pass, when the kingdom was established to him, that he slew his servants that had killed
the king his father.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C25V4">&nbsp;</a>But he slew not their children, but
<span class="add">did</span> as
<span class="add">it is</span> written in the law in the book of Moses, where the LORD commanded, saying, The fathers shall not die
for the children, neither shall the children die for the fathers, but every man shall die for his own
sin.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C25V5">&nbsp;</a>Moreover Amaziah gathered Judah together, and made them captains over thousands, and captains over hundreds,
according to the houses of
<span class="add">their</span> fathers, throughout all Judah and Benjamin: and he numbered them from twenty years old and above, and
found them three hundred thousand choice
<span class="add">men, able</span> to go forth to war, that could handle spear and shield.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C25V6">&nbsp;</a>He hired also an hundred thousand mighty men of valour out of Israel for an hundred talents of silver.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C25V7">&nbsp;</a>But there came a man of God to him, saying, O king, let not the army of Israel go with thee; for the
LORD
<span class="add">is</span> not with Israel,
<span class="add">to wit, with</span> all the children of Ephraim.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C25V8">&nbsp;</a>But if thou wilt go, do
<span class="add">it,</span> be strong for the battle: God shall make thee fall before the enemy: for God hath power to help, and
to cast down.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C25V9">&nbsp;</a>And Amaziah said to the man of God, But what shall we do for the hundred talents which I have given to
the army of Israel? And the man of God answered, The LORD is able to give thee much more than this.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C25V10">&nbsp;</a>Then Amaziah separated them,
<span class="add">to wit,</span> the army that was come to him out of Ephraim, to go home again: wherefore their anger was greatly kindled
against Judah, and they returned home in great anger.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C25V11">&nbsp;</a>And Amaziah strengthened himself, and led forth his people, and went to the valley of salt, and smote
of the children of Seir ten thousand.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C25V12">&nbsp;</a>And
<span class="add">other</span> ten thousand
<span class="add">left</span> alive did the children of Judah carry away captive, and brought them unto the top of the rock, and cast
them down from the top of the rock, that they all were broken in pieces.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C25V13">&nbsp;</a>But the soldiers of the army which Amaziah sent back, that they should not go with him to battle, fell
upon the cities of Judah, from Samaria even unto Beth-horon, and smote three thousand of them, and took
much spoil.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C25V14">&nbsp;</a>Now it came to pass, after that Amaziah was come from the slaughter of the Edomites, that he brought
the gods of the children of Seir, and set them up
<span class="add">to be</span> his gods, and bowed down himself before them, and burned incense unto them.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C25V15">&nbsp;</a>Wherefore the anger of the LORD was kindled against Amaziah, and he sent unto him a prophet, which said
unto him, Why hast thou sought after the gods of the people, which could not deliver their own people
out of thine hand?
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C25V16">&nbsp;</a>And it came to pass, as he talked with him, that
<span class="add">the king</span> said unto him, Art thou made of the king’s counsel? forbear; why shouldest thou be smitten? Then the
prophet forbare, and said, I know that God hath determined to destroy thee, because thou hast done this,
and hast not hearkened unto my counsel.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C25V17">&nbsp;</a>Then Amaziah king of Judah took advice, and sent to Joash, the son of Jehoahaz, the son of Jehu, king
of Israel, saying, Come, let us see one another in the face.
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C25V18">&nbsp;</a>And Joash king of Israel sent to Amaziah king of Judah, saying, The thistle that
<span class="add">was</span> in Lebanon sent to the cedar that
<span class="add">was</span> in Lebanon, saying, Give thy daughter to my son to wife: and there passed by a wild beast that
<span class="add">was</span> in Lebanon, and trode down the thistle.
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C25V19">&nbsp;</a>Thou sayest, Lo, thou hast smitten the Edomites; and thine heart lifteth thee up to boast: abide now
at home; why shouldest thou meddle to
<span class="add">thine</span> hurt, that thou shouldest fall,
<span class="add">even</span> thou, and Judah with thee?
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C25V20">&nbsp;</a>But Amaziah would not hear; for it
<span class="add">came</span> of God, that he might deliver them into the hand
<span class="add">of their enemies,</span> because they sought after the gods of Edom.
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C25V21">&nbsp;</a>So Joash the king of Israel went up; and they saw one another in the face,
<span class="add">both</span> he and Amaziah king of Judah, at Beth-shemesh, which
<span class="add">belongeth</span> to Judah.
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C25V22">&nbsp;</a>And Judah was put to the worse before Israel, and they fled every man to his tent.
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C25V23">&nbsp;</a>And Joash the king of Israel took Amaziah king of Judah, the son of Joash, the son of Jehoahaz, at Beth-shemesh,
and brought him to Jerusalem, and brake down the wall of Jerusalem from the gate of Ephraim to the corner
gate, four hundred cubits.
 <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C25V24">&nbsp;</a>And
<span class="add">he took</span> all the gold and the silver, and all the vessels that were found in the house of God with Obed-edom,
and the treasures of the king’s house, the hostages also, and returned to Samaria.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C25V25">&nbsp;</a>And Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah lived after the death of Joash son of Jehoahaz king of Israel
fifteen years.
 <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C25V26">&nbsp;</a>Now the rest of the acts of Amaziah, first and last, behold,
<span class="add">are</span> they not written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel?
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C25V27">&nbsp;</a>Now after the time that Amaziah did turn away from following the LORD they made a conspiracy against
him in Jerusalem; and he fled to Lachish: but they sent to Lachish after him, and slew him there.
 <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C25V28">&nbsp;</a>And they brought him upon horses, and buried him with his fathers in the city of Judah.
