 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C3V1">&nbsp;</a>Now the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field which the LORD God had made. And he said
unto the woman, Yea, hath God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden?
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C3V2">&nbsp;</a>And the woman said unto the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden:
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C3V3">&nbsp;</a>But of the fruit of the tree which
<span class="add">is</span> in the midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye
die.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C3V4">&nbsp;</a>And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die:
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C3V5">&nbsp;</a>For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as
gods, knowing good and evil.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C3V6">&nbsp;</a>And when the woman saw that the tree
<span class="add">was</span> good for food, and that it
<span class="add">was</span> pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make
<span class="add">one</span> wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto her husband with her; and he did
eat.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C3V7">&nbsp;</a>And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they
<span class="add">were</span> naked; and they sewed fig leaves together, and made themselves aprons.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C3V8">&nbsp;</a>And they heard the voice of the LORD God walking in the garden in the cool of the day: and Adam and his
wife hid themselves from the presence of the LORD God amongst the trees of the garden.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C3V9">&nbsp;</a>And the LORD God called unto Adam, and said unto him, Where
<span class="add">art</span> thou?
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C3V10">&nbsp;</a>And he said, I heard thy voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I
<span class="add">was</span> naked; and I hid myself.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C3V11">&nbsp;</a>And he said, Who told thee that thou
<span class="add">wast</span> naked? Hast thou eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat?
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C3V12">&nbsp;</a>And the man said, The woman whom thou gavest
<span class="add">to be</span> with me, she gave me of the tree, and I did eat.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C3V13">&nbsp;</a>And the LORD God said unto the woman, What
<span class="add">is</span> this
<span class="add">that</span> thou hast done? And the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C3V14">&nbsp;</a>And the LORD God said unto the serpent, Because thou hast done this, thou
<span class="add">art</span> cursed above all cattle, and above every beast of the field; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust
shalt thou eat all the days of thy life:
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C3V15">&nbsp;</a>And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise
thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C3V16">&nbsp;</a>Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception; in sorrow thou shalt bring
forth children; and thy desire
<span class="add">shall be</span> to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C3V17">&nbsp;</a>And unto Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the
tree, of which I commanded thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat of it: cursed
<span class="add">is</span> the ground for thy sake; in sorrow shalt thou eat
<span class="add">of</span> it all the days of thy life;
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C3V18">&nbsp;</a>Thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee; and thou shalt eat the herb of the field;
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C3V19">&nbsp;</a>In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou
taken: for dust thou
<span class="add">art,</span> and unto dust shalt thou return.
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C3V20">&nbsp;</a>And Adam called his wife’s name Eve; because she was the mother of all living.
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C3V21">&nbsp;</a>Unto Adam also and to his wife did the LORD God make coats of skins, and clothed them.
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C3V22">&nbsp;</a>And the LORD God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil: and now, lest he
put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever:
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C3V23">&nbsp;</a>Therefore the LORD God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from whence he was
taken.
 <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C3V24">&nbsp;</a>So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden Cherubim, and a flaming sword
which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life.
