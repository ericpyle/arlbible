 <span class="verse" id="V1">1&nbsp;</span> And the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> appeared  unto him in the plains of Mamre: and he sat in the tent door in the heat of the day;<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup">plain: Heb. plains</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span> And he lift up his eyes and looked, and, lo, three men stood by him: and when he saw <span class='add'>them</span>, he ran to meet them from the tent door, and bowed himself toward the ground,  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span> And said, My Lord, if now I have found favour in thy sight, pass not away, I pray thee, from thy servant:  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span> Let a little water, I pray you, be fetched, and wash your feet, and rest yourselves under the tree:  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span> And I will fetch a morsel of bread, and comfort ye your hearts; after that ye shall pass on: for therefore are ye come to your servant. And they said, So do, as thou hast said.<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup">comfort: Heb. stay</span></a><a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup">are…: Heb. you have passed</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span> And Abraham hastened into the tent unto Sarah, and said, Make ready quickly three measures of fine meal, knead <span class='add'>it</span>, and make cakes upon the hearth.<a href="#FN4" class="notemark">§<span class="popup">Make ready…: Heb.

And he said, Behold, in the tent.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span> And he said, I will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life; and, lo, Sarah thy wife shall have a son. And Sarah heard <span class='add'>it</span> in the tent door, which <span class='add'>was</span> behind him.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span> Now Abraham and Sarah <span class='add'>were</span> old <span class='add'>and</span> well stricken in age; <span class='add'>and</span> it ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span> Therefore Sarah laughed within herself, saying, After I am waxed old shall I have pleasure, my lord being old also?  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span> And the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> said unto Abraham, Wherefore did Sarah laugh, saying, Shall I of a surety bear a child, which am old?  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span> Is any thing too hard for the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>? At the time appointed I will return unto thee, according to the time of life, and Sarah shall have a son.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span> Then Sarah denied, saying, I laughed not; for she was afraid.
