 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C18V1">&nbsp;</a>And the LORD appeared unto him in the plains of Mamre: and he sat in the tent door in the heat of the
day;
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C18V2">&nbsp;</a>And he lift up his eyes and looked, and, lo, three men stood by him: and when he saw
<span class="add">them,</span> he ran to meet them from the tent door, and bowed himself toward the ground,
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C18V3">&nbsp;</a>And said, My Lord, if now I have found favour in thy sight, pass not away, I pray thee, from thy servant:
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C18V4">&nbsp;</a>Let a little water, I pray you, be fetched, and wash your feet, and rest yourselves under the tree:
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C18V5">&nbsp;</a>And I will fetch a morsel of bread, and comfort ye your hearts; after that ye shall pass on: for therefore
are ye come to your servant. And they said, So do, as thou hast said.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C18V6">&nbsp;</a>And Abraham hastened into the tent unto Sarah, and said, Make ready quickly three measures of fine meal,
knead
<span class="add">it,</span> and make cakes upon the hearth.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C18V7">&nbsp;</a>And Abraham ran unto the herd, and fetcht a calf tender and good, and gave
<span class="add">it</span> unto a young man; and he hasted to dress it.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C18V8">&nbsp;</a>And he took butter, and milk, and the calf which he had dressed, and set
<span class="add">it</span> before them; and he stood by them under the tree, and they did eat.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C18V9">&nbsp;</a>And they said unto him, Where
<span class="add">is</span> Sarah thy wife? And he said, Behold, in the tent.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C18V10">&nbsp;</a>And he said, I will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life; and, lo, Sarah thy wife
shall have a son. And Sarah heard
<span class="add">it</span> in the tent door, which
<span class="add">was</span> behind him.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C18V11">&nbsp;</a>Now Abraham and Sarah
<span class="add">were</span> old
<span class="add">and</span> well stricken in age;
<span class="add">and</span> it ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C18V12">&nbsp;</a>Therefore Sarah laughed within herself, saying, After I am waxed old shall I have pleasure, my lord being
old also?
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C18V13">&nbsp;</a>And the LORD said unto Abraham, Wherefore did Sarah laugh, saying, Shall I of a surety bear a child,
which am old?
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C18V14">&nbsp;</a>Is any thing too hard for the LORD? At the time appointed I will return unto thee, according to the time
of life, and Sarah shall have a son.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C18V15">&nbsp;</a>Then Sarah denied, saying, I laughed not; for she was afraid. And he said, Nay; but thou didst laugh.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C18V16">&nbsp;</a>And the men rose up from thence, and looked toward Sodom: and Abraham went with them to bring them on
the way.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C18V17">&nbsp;</a>And the LORD said, Shall I hide from Abraham that thing which I do;
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C18V18">&nbsp;</a>Seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth shall
be blessed in him?
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C18V19">&nbsp;</a>For I know him, that he will command his children and his household after him, and they shall keep the
way of the LORD, to do justice and judgment; that the LORD may bring upon Abraham that which he hath
spoken of him.
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C18V20">&nbsp;</a>And the LORD said, Because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great, and because their sin is very grievous;
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C18V21">&nbsp;</a>I will go down now, and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of it, which is come
unto me; and if not, I will know.
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C18V22">&nbsp;</a>And the men turned their faces from thence, and went toward Sodom: but Abraham stood yet before the LORD.
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C18V23">&nbsp;</a>And Abraham drew near, and said, Wilt thou also destroy the righteous with the wicked?
 <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C18V24">&nbsp;</a>Peradventure there be fifty righteous within the city: wilt thou also destroy and not spare the place
for the fifty righteous that
<span class="add">are</span> therein?
 <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C18V25">&nbsp;</a>That be far from thee to do after this manner, to slay the righteous with the wicked: and that the righteous
should be as the wicked, that be far from thee: Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?
 <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C18V26">&nbsp;</a>And the LORD said, If I find in Sodom fifty righteous within the city, then I will spare all the place
for their sakes.
 <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C18V27">&nbsp;</a>And Abraham answered and said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the Lord, which
<span class="add">am but</span> dust and ashes:
 <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C18V28">&nbsp;</a>Peradventure there shall lack five of the fifty righteous: wilt thou destroy all the city for
<span class="add">lack of</span> five? And he said, If I find there forty and five, I will not destroy
<span class="add">it.
</span> <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C18V29">&nbsp;</a>And he spake unto him yet again, and said, Peradventure there shall be forty found there. And he said,
I will not do
<span class="add">it</span> for forty’s sake.
 <span class="verse"> 30</span><a name="C18V30">&nbsp;</a>And he said
<span class="add">unto him,</span> Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak: Peradventure there shall thirty be found there. And
he said, I will not do
<span class="add">it,</span> if I find thirty there.
 <span class="verse"> 31</span><a name="C18V31">&nbsp;</a>And he said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the Lord: Peradventure there shall be twenty
found there. And he said, I will not destroy
<span class="add">it</span> for twenty’s sake.
 <span class="verse"> 32</span><a name="C18V32">&nbsp;</a>And he said, Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak yet but this once: Peradventure ten shall
be found there. And he said, I will not destroy
<span class="add">it</span> for ten’s sake.
 <span class="verse"> 33</span><a name="C18V33">&nbsp;</a>And the LORD went his way, as soon as he had left communing with Abraham: and Abraham returned unto his
place.
