 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C3V1">&nbsp;</a>Woe to her that is filthy and polluted, to the oppressing city!
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C3V2">&nbsp;</a>She obeyed not the voice; she received not correction; she trusted not in the LORD; she drew not near
to her God.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C3V3">&nbsp;</a>Her princes within her
<span class="add">are</span> roaring lions; her judges
<span class="add">are</span> evening wolves; they gnaw not the bones till the morrow.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C3V4">&nbsp;</a>Her prophets
<span class="add">are</span> light
<span class="add">and</span> treacherous persons: her priests have polluted the sanctuary, they have done violence to the law.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C3V5">&nbsp;</a>The just LORD
<span class="add">is</span> in the midst thereof; he will not do iniquity: every morning doth he bring his judgment to light, he
faileth not; but the unjust knoweth no shame.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C3V6">&nbsp;</a>I have cut off the nations: their towers are desolate; I made their streets waste, that none passeth
by: their cities are destroyed, so that there is no man, that there is none inhabitant.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C3V7">&nbsp;</a>I said, Surely thou wilt fear me, thou wilt receive instruction; so their dwelling should not be cut
off, howsoever I punished them: but they rose early,
<span class="add">and</span> corrupted all their doings.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C3V8">&nbsp;</a>Therefore wait ye upon me, saith the LORD, until the day that I rise up to the prey: for my determination
<span class="add">is</span> to gather the nations, that I may assemble the kingdoms, to pour upon them mine indignation,
<span class="add">even
</span> all my fierce anger: for all the earth shall be devoured with the fire of my jealousy.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C3V9">&nbsp;</a>For then will I turn to the people a pure language, that they may all call upon the name of the LORD,
to serve him with one consent.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C3V10">&nbsp;</a>From beyond the rivers of Ethiopia my suppliants,
<span class="add">even</span> the daughter of my dispersed, shall bring mine offering.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C3V11">&nbsp;</a>In that day shalt thou not be ashamed for all thy doings, wherein thou hast transgressed against me:
for then I will take away out of the midst of thee them that rejoice in thy pride, and thou shalt no
more be haughty because of my holy mountain.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C3V12">&nbsp;</a>I will also leave in the midst of thee an afflicted and poor people, and they shall trust in the name
of the LORD.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C3V13">&nbsp;</a>The remnant of Israel shall not do iniquity, nor speak lies; neither shall a deceitful tongue be found
in their mouth: for they shall feed and lie down, and none shall make
<span class="add">them</span> afraid.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C3V14">&nbsp;</a>Sing, O daughter of Zion; shout, O Israel; be glad and rejoice with all the heart, O daughter of Jerusalem.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C3V15">&nbsp;</a>The LORD hath taken away thy judgments, he hath cast out thine enemy: the king of Israel,
<span class="add">even</span> the LORD,
<span class="add">is</span> in the midst of thee: thou shalt not see evil any more.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C3V16">&nbsp;</a>In that day it shall be said to Jerusalem, Fear thou not:
<span class="add">and to
</span> Zion, Let not thine hands be slack.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C3V17">&nbsp;</a>The LORD thy God in the midst of thee
<span class="add">is</span> mighty; he will save, he will rejoice over thee with joy; he will rest in his love, he will joy over
thee with singing.
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C3V18">&nbsp;</a>I will gather
<span class="add">them that are</span> sorrowful for the solemn assembly,
<span class="add">who</span> are of thee,
<span class="add">to whom</span> the reproach of it
<span class="add">was
</span> a burden.
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C3V19">&nbsp;</a>Behold, at that time I will undo all that afflict thee: and I will save her that halteth, and gather
her that was driven out; and I will get them praise and fame in every land where they have been put to
shame.
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C3V20">&nbsp;</a>At that time will I bring you
<span class="add">again,</span> even in the time that I gather you: for I will make you a name and a praise among all people of the
earth, when I turn back your captivity before your eyes, saith the LORD.
