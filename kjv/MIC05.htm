 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C5V1">&nbsp;</a>Now gather thyself in troops, O daughter of troops: he hath laid siege against us: they shall smite the
judge of Israel with a rod upon the cheek.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C5V2">&nbsp;</a>But thou, Bethlehem Ephratah,
<span class="add">though</span> thou be little among the thousands of Judah,
<span class="add">yet</span> out of thee shall he come forth unto me
<span class="add">that is</span> to be ruler in Israel; whose goings forth
<span class="add">have been
</span> from of old, from everlasting.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C5V3">&nbsp;</a>Therefore will he give them up, until the time
<span class="add">that</span> she which travaileth hath brought forth: then the remnant of his brethren shall return unto the children
of Israel.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C5V4">&nbsp;</a>And he shall stand and feed in the strength of the LORD, in the majesty of the name of the LORD his God;
and they shall abide: for now shall he be great unto the ends of the earth.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C5V5">&nbsp;</a>And this
<span class="add">man</span> shall be the peace, when the Assyrian shall come into our land: and when he shall tread in our palaces,
then shall we raise against him seven shepherds, and eight principal men.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C5V6">&nbsp;</a>And they shall waste the land of Assyria with the sword, and the land of Nimrod in the entrances thereof:
thus shall he deliver
<span class="add">us</span> from the Assyrian, when he cometh into our land, and when he treadeth within our borders.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C5V7">&nbsp;</a>And the remnant of Jacob shall be in the midst of many people as a dew from the LORD, as the showers
upon the grass, that tarrieth not for man, nor waiteth for the sons of men.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C5V8">&nbsp;</a>And the remnant of Jacob shall be among the Gentiles in the midst of many people as a lion among the
beasts of the forest, as a young lion among the flocks of sheep: who, if he go through, both treadeth
down, and teareth in pieces, and none can deliver.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C5V9">&nbsp;</a>Thine hand shall be lifted up upon thine adversaries, and all thine enemies shall be cut off.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C5V10">&nbsp;</a>And it shall come to pass in that day, saith the LORD, that I will cut off thy horses out of the midst
of thee, and I will destroy thy chariots:
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C5V11">&nbsp;</a>And I will cut off the cities of thy land, and throw down all thy strong holds:
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C5V12">&nbsp;</a>And I will cut off witchcrafts out of thine hand; and thou shalt have no
<span class="add">more</span> soothsayers:
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C5V13">&nbsp;</a>Thy graven images also will I cut off, and thy standing images out of the midst of thee; and thou shalt
no more worship the work of thine hands.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C5V14">&nbsp;</a>And I will pluck up thy groves out of the midst of thee: so will I destroy thy cities.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C5V15">&nbsp;</a>And I will execute vengeance in anger and fury upon the heathen, such as they have not heard.
