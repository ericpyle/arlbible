 <span class="verse" id="V1">1&nbsp;</span>Wine <span class='add'>is</span> a mocker, strong drink <span class='add'>is</span> raging: and whosoever is deceived thereby is not wise.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span>The fear of a king <span class='add'>is</span> as the roaring of a lion: <span class='add'>whoso</span> provoketh him to anger sinneth <span class='add'>against</span> his own soul.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span> <span class='add'>It is</span> an honour for a man to cease from strife: but every fool will be meddling.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>The sluggard will not plow by reason of the cold; <span class='add'>therefore</span> shall he beg in harvest, and <span class='add'>have</span> nothing.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>Counsel in the heart of man <span class='add'>is like</span> deep water; but a man of understanding will draw it out.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>Most men will proclaim every one his own goodness: but a faithful man who can find?  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>The just <span class='add'>man</span> walketh in his integrity: his children <span class='add'>are</span> blessed after him.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>A king that sitteth in the throne of judgment scattereth away all evil with his eyes.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>Who can say, I have made my heart clean, I am pure from my sin?  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>Divers weights, <span class='add'>and</span> divers measures, both of them <span class='add'>are</span> alike abomination to the LORD.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>Even a child is known by his doings, whether his work <span class='add'>be</span> pure, and whether <span class='add'>it be</span> right.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>The hearing ear, and the seeing eye, the LORD hath made even both of them.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>Love not sleep, lest thou come to poverty; open thine eyes, <span class='add'>and</span> thou shalt be satisfied with bread.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span> <span class='add'>It is</span> naught, <span class='add'>it is</span> naught, saith the buyer: but when he is gone his way, then he boasteth.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>There is gold, and a multitude of rubies: but the lips of knowledge <span class='add'>are</span> a precious jewel.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>Take his garment that is surety <span class='add'>for</span> a stranger: and take a pledge of him for a strange woman.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>Bread of deceit <span class='add'>is</span> sweet to a man; but afterwards his mouth shall be filled with gravel.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span> <span class='add'>Every</span> purpose is established by counsel: and with good advice make war.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>He that goeth about <span class='add'>as</span> a talebearer revealeth secrets: therefore meddle not with him that flattereth with his lips.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>Whoso curseth his father or his mother, his lamp shall be put out in obscure darkness.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>An inheritance <span class='add'>may be</span> gotten hastily at the beginning; but the end thereof shall not be blessed.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>Say not thou, I will recompense evil; <span class='add'>but</span> wait on the LORD, and he shall save thee.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>Divers weights <span class='add'>are</span> an abomination unto the LORD; and a false balance <span class='add'>is</span> not good.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>Man’s goings <span class='add'>are</span> of the LORD; how can a man then understand his own way?  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span> <span class='add'>It is</span> a snare to the man <span class='add'>who</span> devoureth <span class='add'>that which is</span> holy, and after vows to make enquiry.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>A wise king scattereth the wicked, and bringeth the wheel over them.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>The spirit of man <span class='add'>is</span> the candle of the LORD, searching all the inward parts of the belly.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&nbsp;</span>Mercy and truth preserve the king: and his throne is upholden by mercy.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&nbsp;</span>The glory of young men <span class='add'>is</span> their strength: and the beauty of old men <span class='add'>is</span> the grey head.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&nbsp;</span>The blueness of a wound cleanseth away evil: so <span class='add'>do</span> stripes the inward parts of the belly. </div><ul class='tnav'>
