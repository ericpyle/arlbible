 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C2V1">&nbsp;</a>And there went a man of the house of Levi, and took
<span class="add">to wife
</span> a daughter of Levi.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C2V2">&nbsp;</a>And the woman conceived, and bare a son: and when she saw him that he
<span class="add">was a</span> goodly
<span class="add">child,</span> she hid him three months.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C2V3">&nbsp;</a>And when she could not longer hide him, she took for him an ark of bulrushes, and daubed it with slime
and with pitch, and put the child therein; and she laid
<span class="add">it</span> in the flags by the river’s brink.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C2V4">&nbsp;</a>And his sister stood afar off, to wit what would be done to him.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C2V5">&nbsp;</a>And the daughter of Pharaoh came down to wash
<span class="add">herself</span> at the river; and her maidens walked along by the river’s side; and when she saw the ark among the flags,
she sent her maid to fetch it.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C2V6">&nbsp;</a>And when she had opened
<span class="add">it,</span> she saw the child: and, behold, the babe wept. And she had compassion on him, and said, This
<span class="add">is one
</span> of the Hebrews’ children.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C2V7">&nbsp;</a>Then said his sister to Pharaoh’s daughter, Shall I go and call to thee a nurse of the Hebrew women,
that she may nurse the child for thee?
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C2V8">&nbsp;</a>And Pharaoh’s daughter said to her, Go. And the maid went and called the child’s mother.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C2V9">&nbsp;</a>And Pharaoh’s daughter said unto her, Take this child away, and nurse it for me, and I will give
<span class="add">thee</span> thy wages. And the woman took the child, and nursed it.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C2V10">&nbsp;</a>And the child grew, and she brought him unto Pharaoh’s daughter, and he became her son. And she called
his name Moses: and she said, Because I drew him out of the water.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C2V11">&nbsp;</a>And it came to pass in those days, when Moses was grown, that he went out unto his brethren, and looked
on their burdens: and he spied an Egyptian smiting an Hebrew, one of his brethren.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C2V12">&nbsp;</a>And he looked this way and that way, and when he saw that
<span class="add">there was</span> no man, he slew the Egyptian, and hid him in the sand.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C2V13">&nbsp;</a>And when he went out the second day, behold, two men of the Hebrews strove together: and he said to him
that did the wrong, Wherefore smitest thou thy fellow?
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C2V14">&nbsp;</a>And he said, Who made thee a prince and a judge over us? intendest thou to kill me, as thou killedst
the Egyptian? And Moses feared, and said, Surely this thing is known.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C2V15">&nbsp;</a>Now when Pharaoh heard this thing, he sought to slay Moses. But Moses fled from the face of Pharaoh,
and dwelt in the land of Midian: and he sat down by a well.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C2V16">&nbsp;</a>Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters: and they came and drew
<span class="add">water,</span> and filled the troughs to water their father’s flock.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C2V17">&nbsp;</a>And the shepherds came and drove them away: but Moses stood up and helped them, and watered their flock.
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C2V18">&nbsp;</a>And when they came to Reuel their father, he said, How
<span class="add">is it that
</span> ye are come so soon to day?
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C2V19">&nbsp;</a>And they said, An Egyptian delivered us out of the hand of the shepherds, and also drew
<span class="add">water</span> enough for us, and watered the flock.
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C2V20">&nbsp;</a>And he said unto his daughters, And where
<span class="add">is</span> he? why
<span class="add">is</span> it
<span class="add">that</span> ye have left the man? call him, that he may eat bread.
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C2V21">&nbsp;</a>And Moses was content to dwell with the man: and he gave Moses Zipporah his daughter.
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C2V22">&nbsp;</a>And she bare
<span class="add">him</span> a son, and he called his name Gershom: for he said, I have been a stranger in a strange land.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C2V23">&nbsp;</a>And it came to pass in process of time, that the king of Egypt died: and the children of Israel sighed
by reason of the bondage, and they cried, and their cry came up unto God by reason of the bondage.
 <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C2V24">&nbsp;</a>And God heard their groaning, and God remembered his covenant with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob.
 <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C2V25">&nbsp;</a>And God looked upon the children of Israel, and God had respect unto
<span class="add">them.</span></div>
