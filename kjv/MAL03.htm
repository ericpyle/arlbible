 <span class="verse" id="V1">1&nbsp;</span>Behold, I will send my messenger, and he shall prepare the way before me: and the Lord, whom ye seek, shall suddenly come to his temple, even the messenger of the covenant, whom ye delight in: behold, he shall come, saith the LORD of hosts.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span>But who may abide the day of his coming? and who shall stand when he appeareth? for he <span class='add'>is</span> like a refiner’s fire, and like fullers’ soap:  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>And he shall sit <span class='add'>as</span> a refiner and purifier of silver: and he shall purify the sons of Levi, and purge them as gold and silver, that they may offer unto the LORD an offering in righteousness.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>Then shall the offering of Judah and Jerusalem be pleasant unto the LORD, as in the days of old, and as in former years.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>And I will come near to you to judgment; and I will be a swift witness against the sorcerers, and against the adulterers, and against false swearers, and against those that oppress the hireling in <span class='add'>his</span> wages, the widow, and the fatherless, and that turn aside the stranger <span class='add'>from his right</span>, and fear not me, saith the LORD of hosts.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>For I <span class='add'>am</span> the LORD, I change not; therefore ye sons of Jacob are not consumed. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>Even from the days of your fathers ye are gone away from mine ordinances, and have not kept <span class='add'>them</span>. Return unto me, and I will return unto you, saith the LORD of hosts. But ye said, Wherein shall we return? </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>Will a man rob God? Yet ye have robbed me. But ye say, Wherein have we robbed thee?
