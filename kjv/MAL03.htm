 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C3V1">&nbsp;</a>Behold, I will send my messenger, and he shall prepare the way before me: and the Lord, whom ye seek,
shall suddenly come to his temple, even the messenger of the covenant, whom ye delight in: behold, he
shall come, saith the LORD of hosts.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C3V2">&nbsp;</a>But who may abide the day of his coming? and who shall stand when he appeareth? for he
<span class="add">is</span> like a refiner’s fire, and like fullers’ sope:
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C3V3">&nbsp;</a>And he shall sit
<span class="add">as</span> a refiner and purifier of silver: and he shall purify the sons of Levi, and purge them as gold and silver,
that they may offer unto the LORD an offering in righteousness.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C3V4">&nbsp;</a>Then shall the offering of Judah and Jerusalem be pleasant unto the LORD, as in the days of old, and
as in former years.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C3V5">&nbsp;</a>And I will come near to you to judgment; and I will be a swift witness against the sorcerers, and against
the adulterers, and against false swearers, and against those that oppress the hireling in
<span class="add">his</span> wages, the widow, and the fatherless, and that turn aside the stranger
<span class="add">from his right,
</span> and fear not me, saith the LORD of hosts.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C3V6">&nbsp;</a>For I
<span class="add">am</span> the LORD, I change not; therefore ye sons of Jacob are not consumed.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C3V7">&nbsp;</a>Even from the days of your fathers ye are gone away from mine ordinances, and have not kept
<span class="add">them.</span> Return unto me, and I will return unto you, saith the LORD of hosts. But ye said, Wherein shall we return?
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C3V8">&nbsp;</a>Will a man rob God? Yet ye have robbed me. But ye say, Wherein have we robbed thee? In tithes and offerings.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C3V9">&nbsp;</a>Ye
<span class="add">are</span> cursed with a curse: for ye have robbed me,
<span class="add">even
</span> this whole nation.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C3V10">&nbsp;</a>Bring ye all the tithes into the storehouse, that there may be meat in mine house, and prove me now herewith,
saith the LORD of hosts, if I will not open you the windows of heaven, and pour you out a blessing, that
<span class="add">there shall</span> not
<span class="add">be room</span> enough
<span class="add">to receive it.
</span> <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C3V11">&nbsp;</a>And I will rebuke the devourer for your sakes, and he shall not destroy the fruits of your ground; neither
shall your vine cast her fruit before the time in the field, saith the LORD of hosts.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C3V12">&nbsp;</a>And all nations shall call you blessed: for ye shall be a delightsome land, saith the LORD of hosts.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C3V13">&nbsp;</a>Your words have been stout against me, saith the LORD. Yet ye say, What have we spoken
<span class="add">so much</span> against thee?
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C3V14">&nbsp;</a>Ye have said, It
<span class="add">is</span> vain to serve God: and what profit
<span class="add">is it</span> that we have kept his ordinance, and that we have walked mournfully before the LORD of hosts?
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C3V15">&nbsp;</a>And now we call the proud happy; yea, they that work wickedness are set up; yea,
<span class="add">they that</span> tempt God are even delivered.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C3V16">&nbsp;</a>Then they that feared the LORD spake often one to another: and the LORD hearkened, and heard
<span class="add">it,</span> and a book of remembrance was written before him for them that feared the LORD, and that thought upon
his name.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C3V17">&nbsp;</a>And they shall be mine, saith the LORD of hosts, in that day when I make up my jewels; and I will spare
them, as a man spareth his own son that serveth him.
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C3V18">&nbsp;</a>Then shall ye return, and discern between the righteous and the wicked, between him that serveth God
and him that serveth him not.
