 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C1V1">&nbsp;</a>The word of the LORD that came to Micah the Morasthite in the days of Jotham, Ahaz,
<span class="add">and</span> Hezekiah, kings of Judah, which he saw concerning Samaria and Jerusalem.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C1V2">&nbsp;</a>Hear, all ye people; hearken, O earth, and all that therein is: and let the Lord GOD be witness against
you, the Lord from his holy temple.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C1V3">&nbsp;</a>For, behold, the LORD cometh forth out of his place, and will come down, and tread upon the high places
of the earth.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C1V4">&nbsp;</a>And the mountains shall be molten under him, and the valleys shall be cleft, as wax before the fire,
<span class="add">and</span> as the waters
<span class="add">that are
</span> poured down a steep place.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C1V5">&nbsp;</a>For the transgression of Jacob
<span class="add">is</span> all this, and for the sins of the house of Israel. What
<span class="add">is</span> the transgression of Jacob?
<span class="add">is it
</span> not Samaria? and what
<span class="add">are</span> the high places of Judah?
<span class="add">are they</span> not Jerusalem?
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C1V6">&nbsp;</a>Therefore I will make Samaria as an heap of the field,
<span class="add">and
</span> as plantings of a vineyard: and I will pour down the stones thereof into the valley, and I will discover
the foundations thereof.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C1V7">&nbsp;</a>And all the graven images thereof shall be beaten to pieces, and all the hires thereof shall be burned
with the fire, and all the idols thereof will I lay desolate: for she gathered
<span class="add">it</span> of the hire of an harlot, and they shall return to the hire of an harlot.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C1V8">&nbsp;</a>Therefore I will wail and howl, I will go stripped and naked: I will make a wailing like the dragons,
and mourning as the owls.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C1V9">&nbsp;</a>For her wound
<span class="add">is</span> incurable; for it is come unto Judah; he is come unto the gate of my people,
<span class="add">even</span> to Jerusalem.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C1V10">&nbsp;</a>Declare ye
<span class="add">it</span> not at Gath, weep ye not at all: in the house of Aphrah roll thyself in the dust.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C1V11">&nbsp;</a>Pass ye away, thou inhabitant of Saphir, having thy shame naked: the inhabitant of Zaanan came not forth
in the mourning of Beth-ezel; he shall receive of you his standing.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C1V12">&nbsp;</a>For the inhabitant of Maroth waited carefully for good: but evil came down from the LORD unto the gate
of Jerusalem.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C1V13">&nbsp;</a>O thou inhabitant of Lachish, bind the chariot to the swift beast: she
<span class="add">is</span> the beginning of the sin to the daughter of Zion: for the transgressions of Israel were found in thee.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C1V14">&nbsp;</a>Therefore shalt thou give presents to Moresheth-gath: the houses of Achzib
<span class="add">shall be</span> a lie to the kings of Israel.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C1V15">&nbsp;</a>Yet will I bring an heir unto thee, O inhabitant of Mareshah: he shall come unto Adullam the glory of
Israel.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C1V16">&nbsp;</a>Make thee bald, and poll thee for thy delicate children; enlarge thy baldness as the eagle; for they
are gone into captivity from thee.
