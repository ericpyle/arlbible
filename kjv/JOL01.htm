Hath this been in your days, or even in the days of your fathers?  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>Tell ye your children of it, and <span class='add'>let</span> your children <span class='add'>tell</span> their children, and their children another generation.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>That which the palmerworm hath left hath the locust eaten; and that which the locust hath left hath the cankerworm eaten; and that which the cankerworm hath left hath the caterpiller eaten.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>Awake, ye drunkards, and weep; and howl, all ye drinkers of wine, because of the new wine; for it is cut off from your mouth.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>For a nation is come up upon my land, strong, and without number, whose teeth <span class='add'>are</span> the teeth of a lion, and he hath the cheek teeth of a great lion.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>He hath laid my vine waste, and barked my fig tree: he hath made it clean bare, and cast <span class='add'>it</span> away; the branches thereof are made white. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>Lament like a virgin girded with sackcloth for the husband of her youth.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>The meat offering and the drink offering is cut off from the house of the LORD; the priests, the LORD’s ministers, mourn.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>The field is wasted, the land mourneth; for the corn is wasted: the new wine is dried up, the oil languisheth.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>Be ye ashamed, O ye husbandmen; howl, O ye vinedressers, for the wheat and for the barley; because the harvest of the field is perished.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>The vine is dried up, and the fig tree languisheth; the pomegranate tree, the palm tree also, and the apple tree, <span class='add'>even</span> all the trees of the field, are withered: because joy is withered away from the sons of men.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>Gird yourselves, and lament, ye priests: howl, ye ministers of the altar: come, lie all night in sackcloth, ye ministers of my God: for the meat offering and the drink offering is withholden from the house of your God. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>Sanctify ye a fast, call a solemn assembly, gather the elders <span class='add'>and</span> all the inhabitants of the land <span class='add'>into</span> the house of the LORD your God, and cry unto the LORD,  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>Alas for the day! for the day of the LORD <span class='add'>is</span> at hand, and as a destruction from the Almighty shall it come.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>Is not the meat cut off before our eyes, <span class='add'>yea</span>, joy and gladness from the house of our God?  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>The seed is rotten under their clods, the garners are laid desolate, the barns are broken down; for the corn is withered.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>How do the beasts groan! the herds of cattle are perplexed, because they have no pasture; yea, the flocks of sheep are made desolate.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>O LORD, to thee will I cry: for the fire hath devoured the pastures of the wilderness, and the flame hath burned all the trees of the field.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>The beasts of the field cry also unto thee: for the rivers of waters are dried up, and the fire hath devoured the pastures of the wilderness. </div><ul class='tnav'>
