 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C1V1">&nbsp;</a>The word of the LORD that came to Joel the son of Pethuel.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C1V2">&nbsp;</a>Hear this, ye old men, and give ear, all ye inhabitants of the land. Hath this been in your days, or
even in the days of your fathers?
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C1V3">&nbsp;</a>Tell ye your children of it, and
<span class="add">let</span> your children
<span class="add">tell</span> their children, and their children another generation.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C1V4">&nbsp;</a>That which the palmerworm hath left hath the locust eaten; and that which the locust hath left hath the
cankerworm eaten; and that which the cankerworm hath left hath the caterpiller eaten.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C1V5">&nbsp;</a>Awake, ye drunkards, and weep; and howl, all ye drinkers of wine, because of the new wine; for it is
cut off from your mouth.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C1V6">&nbsp;</a>For a nation is come up upon my land, strong, and without number, whose teeth
<span class="add">are</span> the teeth of a lion, and he hath the cheek teeth of a great lion.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C1V7">&nbsp;</a>He hath laid my vine waste, and barked my fig tree: he hath made it clean bare, and cast
<span class="add">it</span> away; the branches thereof are made white.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C1V8">&nbsp;</a>Lament like a virgin girded with sackcloth for the husband of her youth.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C1V9">&nbsp;</a>The meat offering and the drink offering is cut off from the house of the LORD; the priests, the LORD’S
ministers, mourn.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C1V10">&nbsp;</a>The field is wasted, the land mourneth; for the corn is wasted: the new wine is dried up, the oil languisheth.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C1V11">&nbsp;</a>Be ye ashamed, O ye husbandmen; howl, O ye vinedressers, for the wheat and for the barley; because the
harvest of the field is perished.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C1V12">&nbsp;</a>The vine is dried up, and the fig tree languisheth; the pomegranate tree, the palm tree also, and the
apple tree,
<span class="add">even</span> all the trees of the field, are withered: because joy is withered away from the sons of men.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C1V13">&nbsp;</a>Gird yourselves, and lament, ye priests: howl, ye ministers of the altar: come, lie all night in sackcloth,
ye ministers of my God: for the meat offering and the drink offering is withholden from the house of
your God.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C1V14">&nbsp;</a>Sanctify ye a fast, call a solemn assembly, gather the elders
<span class="add">and</span> all the inhabitants of the land
<span class="add">into</span> the house of the LORD your God, and cry unto the LORD,
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C1V15">&nbsp;</a>Alas for the day! for the day of the LORD
<span class="add">is</span> at hand, and as a destruction from the Almighty shall it come.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C1V16">&nbsp;</a>Is not the meat cut off before our eyes,
<span class="add">yea,</span> joy and gladness from the house of our God?
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C1V17">&nbsp;</a>The seed is rotten under their clods, the garners are laid desolate, the barns are broken down; for the
corn is withered.
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C1V18">&nbsp;</a>How do the beasts groan! the herds of cattle are perplexed, because they have no pasture; yea, the flocks
of sheep are made desolate.
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C1V19">&nbsp;</a>O LORD, to thee will I cry: for the fire hath devoured the pastures of the wilderness, and the flame
hath burned all the trees of the field.
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C1V20">&nbsp;</a>The beasts of the field cry also unto thee: for the rivers of waters are dried up, and the fire hath
devoured the pastures of the wilderness.
