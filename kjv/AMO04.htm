 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C4V1">&nbsp;</a>Hear this word, ye kine of Bashan, that
<span class="add">are</span> in the mountain of Samaria, which oppress the poor, which crush the needy, which say to their masters,
Bring, and let us drink.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C4V2">&nbsp;</a>The Lord GOD hath sworn by his holiness, that, lo, the days shall come upon you, that he will take you
away with hooks, and your posterity with fishhooks.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C4V3">&nbsp;</a>And ye shall go out at the breaches, every
<span class="add">cow at that which is
</span> before her; and ye shall cast
<span class="add">them</span> into the palace, saith the LORD.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C4V4">&nbsp;</a>Come to Bethel, and transgress; at Gilgal multiply transgression; and bring your sacrifices every morning,
<span class="add">and</span> your tithes after three years:
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C4V5">&nbsp;</a>And offer a sacrifice of thanksgiving with leaven, and proclaim
<span class="add">and</span> publish the free offerings: for this liketh you, O ye children of Israel, saith the Lord GOD.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C4V6">&nbsp;</a>And I also have given you cleanness of teeth in all your cities, and want of bread in all your places:
yet have ye not returned unto me, saith the LORD.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C4V7">&nbsp;</a>And also I have withholden the rain from you, when
<span class="add">there were
</span> yet three months to the harvest: and I caused it to rain upon one city, and caused it not to rain upon
another city: one piece was rained upon, and the piece whereupon it rained not withered.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C4V8">&nbsp;</a>So two
<span class="add">or</span> three cities wandered unto one city, to drink water; but they were not satisfied: yet have ye not returned
unto me, saith the LORD.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C4V9">&nbsp;</a>I have smitten you with blasting and mildew: when your gardens and your vineyards and your fig trees
and your olive trees increased, the palmerworm devoured
<span class="add">them:</span> yet have ye not returned unto me, saith the LORD.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C4V10">&nbsp;</a>I have sent among you the pestilence after the manner of Egypt: your young men have I slain with the
sword, and have taken away your horses; and I have made the stink of your camps to come up unto your
nostrils: yet have ye not returned unto me, saith the LORD.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C4V11">&nbsp;</a>I have overthrown
<span class="add">some</span> of you, as God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah, and ye were as a firebrand plucked out of the burning:
yet have ye not returned unto me, saith the LORD.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C4V12">&nbsp;</a>Therefore thus will I do unto thee, O Israel:
<span class="add">and</span> because I will do this unto thee, prepare to meet thy God, O Israel.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C4V13">&nbsp;</a>For, lo, he that formeth the mountains, and createth the wind, and declareth unto man what
<span class="add">is</span> his thought, that maketh the morning darkness, and treadeth upon the high places of the earth, The LORD,
The God of hosts,
<span class="add">is</span> his name.
