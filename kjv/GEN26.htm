 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C26V1">&nbsp;</a>And there was a famine in the land, beside the first famine that was in the days of Abraham. And Isaac
went unto Abimelech king of the Philistines unto Gerar.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C26V2">&nbsp;</a>And the LORD appeared unto him, and said, Go not down into Egypt; dwell in the land which I shall tell
thee of:
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C26V3">&nbsp;</a>Sojourn in this land, and I will be with thee, and will bless thee; for unto thee, and unto thy seed,
I will give all these countries, and I will perform the oath which I sware unto Abraham thy father;
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C26V4">&nbsp;</a>And I will make thy seed to multiply as the stars of heaven, and will give unto thy seed all these countries;
and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed;
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C26V5">&nbsp;</a>Because that Abraham obeyed my voice, and kept my charge, my commandments, my statutes, and my laws.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C26V6">&nbsp;</a>And Isaac dwelt in Gerar:
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C26V7">&nbsp;</a>And the men of the place asked
<span class="add">him</span> of his wife; and he said, She
<span class="add">is</span> my sister: for he feared to say,
<span class="add">She is</span> my wife; lest,
<span class="add">said he,</span> the men of the place should kill me for Rebekah; because she
<span class="add">was</span> fair to look upon.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C26V8">&nbsp;</a>And it came to pass, when he had been there a long time, that Abimelech king of the Philistines looked
out at a window, and saw, and, behold, Isaac
<span class="add">was</span> sporting with Rebekah his wife.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C26V9">&nbsp;</a>And Abimelech called Isaac, and said, Behold, of a surety she
<span class="add">is
</span> thy wife: and how saidst thou, She
<span class="add">is</span> my sister? And Isaac said unto him, Because I said, Lest I die for her.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C26V10">&nbsp;</a>And Abimelech said, What
<span class="add">is</span> this thou hast done unto us? one of the people might lightly have lien with thy wife, and thou shouldest
have brought guiltiness upon us.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C26V11">&nbsp;</a>And Abimelech charged all
<span class="add">his</span> people, saying, He that toucheth this man or his wife shall surely be put to death.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C26V12">&nbsp;</a>Then Isaac sowed in that land, and received in the same year an hundredfold: and the LORD blessed him.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C26V13">&nbsp;</a>And the man waxed great, and went forward, and grew until he became very great:
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C26V14">&nbsp;</a>For he had possession of flocks, and possession of herds, and great store of servants: and the Philistines
envied him.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C26V15">&nbsp;</a>For all the wells which his father’s servants had digged in the days of Abraham his father, the Philistines
had stopped them, and filled them with earth.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C26V16">&nbsp;</a>And Abimelech said unto Isaac, Go from us; for thou art much mightier than we.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C26V17">&nbsp;</a>And Isaac departed thence, and pitched his tent in the valley of Gerar, and dwelt there.
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C26V18">&nbsp;</a>And Isaac digged again the wells of water, which they had digged in the days of Abraham his father; for
the philistines had stopped them after the death of Abraham: and he called their names after the names
by which his father had called them.
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C26V19">&nbsp;</a>And Isaac’s servants digged in the valley, and found there a well of springing water.
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C26V20">&nbsp;</a>And the herdmen of Gerar did strive with Isaac’s herdmen, saying, The water
<span class="add">is</span> ours: and he called the name of the well Esek; because they strove with him.
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C26V21">&nbsp;</a>And they digged another well, and strove for that also: and he called the name of it Sitnah.
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C26V22">&nbsp;</a>And he removed from thence, and digged another well; and for that they strove not: and he called the
name of it Rehoboth; and he said, For now the LORD hath made room for us, and we shall be fruitful in
the land.
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C26V23">&nbsp;</a>And he went up from thence to Beer-sheba.
 <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C26V24">&nbsp;</a>And the LORD appeared unto him the same night, and said, I
<span class="add">am
</span> the God of Abraham thy father: fear not, for I
<span class="add">am</span> with thee, and will bless thee, and multiply thy seed for my servant Abraham’s sake.
 <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C26V25">&nbsp;</a>And he builded an altar there, and called upon the name of the LORD and pitched his tent there: and there
Isaac’s servants digged a well.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C26V26">&nbsp;</a>Then Abimelech went to him from Gerar, and Ahuzzath one of his friends, and Phichol the chief captain
of his army.
 <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C26V27">&nbsp;</a>And Isaac said unto them, Wherefore come ye to me, seeing ye hate me, and have sent me away from you?
 <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C26V28">&nbsp;</a>And they said, We saw certainly that the LORD was with thee: and we said, Let there be now an oath betwixt
us,
<span class="add">even</span> betwixt us and thee, and let us make a covenant with thee;
 <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C26V29">&nbsp;</a>That thou wilt do us no hurt, as we have not touched thee, and as we have done unto thee nothing but
good, and have sent thee away in peace: thou
<span class="add">art</span> now the blessed of the LORD.
 <span class="verse"> 30</span><a name="C26V30">&nbsp;</a>And he made them a feast, and they did eat and drink.
 <span class="verse"> 31</span><a name="C26V31">&nbsp;</a>And they rose up betimes in the morning, and sware one to another: and Isaac sent them away, and they
departed from him in peace.
 <span class="verse"> 32</span><a name="C26V32">&nbsp;</a>And it came to pass the same day, that Isaac’s servants came, and told him concerning the well which
they had digged, and said unto him, We have found water.
 <span class="verse"> 33</span><a name="C26V33">&nbsp;</a>And he called it Shebah: therefore the name of the city
<span class="add">is
</span> Beer-sheba unto this day.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 34</span><a name="C26V34">&nbsp;</a>And Esau was forty years old when he took to wife Judith the daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and Bashemath
the daughter of Elon the Hittite:
 <span class="verse"> 35</span><a name="C26V35">&nbsp;</a>Which were a grief of mind unto Isaac and to Rebekah.
