 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C8V1">&nbsp;</a>At that time, saith the LORD, they shall bring out the bones of the kings of Judah, and the bones of
his princes, and the bones of the priests, and the bones of the prophets, and the bones of the inhabitants
of Jerusalem, out of their graves:
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C8V2">&nbsp;</a>And they shall spread them before the sun, and the moon, and all the host of heaven, whom they have loved,
and whom they have served, and after whom they have walked, and whom they have sought, and whom they
have worshipped: they shall not be gathered, nor be buried; they shall be for dung upon the face of the
earth.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C8V3">&nbsp;</a>And death shall be chosen rather than life by all the residue of them that remain of this evil family,
which remain in all the places whither I have driven them, saith the LORD of hosts.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C8V4">&nbsp;</a>Moreover thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the LORD; Shall they fall, and not arise? shall he turn
away, and not return?
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C8V5">&nbsp;</a>Why
<span class="add">then</span> is this people of Jerusalem slidden back by a perpetual backsliding? they hold fast deceit, they refuse
to return.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C8V6">&nbsp;</a>I hearkened and heard,
<span class="add">but</span> they spake not aright: no man repented him of his wickedness, saying, What have I done? every one turned
to his course, as the horse rusheth into the battle.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C8V7">&nbsp;</a>Yea, the stork in the heaven knoweth her appointed times; and the turtle and the crane and the swallow
observe the time of their coming; but my people know not the judgment of the LORD.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C8V8">&nbsp;</a>How do ye say, We
<span class="add">are</span> wise, and the law of the LORD
<span class="add">is
</span> with us? Lo, certainly in vain made he
<span class="add">it;</span> the pen of the scribes
<span class="add">is</span> in vain.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C8V9">&nbsp;</a>The wise
<span class="add">men</span> are ashamed, they are dismayed and taken: lo, they have rejected the word of the LORD; and what wisdom
<span class="add">is</span> in them?
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C8V10">&nbsp;</a>Therefore will I give their wives unto others,
<span class="add">and</span> their fields to them that shall inherit
<span class="add">them:</span> for every one from the least even unto the greatest is given to covetousness, from the prophet even
unto the priest every one dealeth falsely.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C8V11">&nbsp;</a>For they have healed the hurt of the daughter of my people slightly, saying, Peace, peace; when
<span class="add">there is</span> no peace.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C8V12">&nbsp;</a>Were they ashamed when they had committed abomination? nay, they were not at all ashamed, neither could
they blush: therefore shall they fall among them that fall: in the time of their visitation they shall
be cast down, saith the LORD.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C8V13">&nbsp;</a>I will surely consume them, saith the LORD:
<span class="add">there shall be
</span> no grapes on the vine, nor figs on the fig tree, and the leaf shall fade; and
<span class="add">the things that</span> I have given them shall pass away from them.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C8V14">&nbsp;</a>Why do we sit still? assemble yourselves, and let us enter into the defenced cities, and let us be silent
there: for the LORD our God hath put us to silence, and given us water of gall to drink, because we have
sinned against the LORD.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C8V15">&nbsp;</a>We looked for peace, but no good
<span class="add">came; and</span> for a time of health, and behold trouble!
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C8V16">&nbsp;</a>The snorting of his horses was heard from Dan: the whole land trembled at the sound of the neighing of
his strong ones; for they are come, and have devoured the land, and all that is in it; the city, and
those that dwell therein.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C8V17">&nbsp;</a>For, behold, I will send serpents, cockatrices, among you, which
<span class="add">will</span> not
<span class="add">be</span> charmed, and they shall bite you, saith the LORD.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C8V18">&nbsp;</a><span class="add">When</span> I would comfort myself against sorrow, my heart
<span class="add">is</span> faint in me.
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C8V19">&nbsp;</a>Behold the voice of the cry of the daughter of my people because of them that dwell in a far country:
<span class="add">Is</span> not the LORD in Zion?
<span class="add">is
</span> not her king in her? Why have they provoked me to anger with their graven images,
<span class="add">and</span> with strange vanities?
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C8V20">&nbsp;</a>The harvest is past, the summer is ended, and we are not saved.
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C8V21">&nbsp;</a>For the hurt of the daughter of my people am I hurt; I am black; astonishment hath taken hold on me.
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C8V22">&nbsp;</a><span class="add">Is there</span> no balm in Gilead;
<span class="add">is there</span> no physician there? why then is not the health of the daughter of my people recovered?
