Lo, certainly in vain made he <span class='add'>it;</span> the pen of the scribes <span class='add'>is</span> in vain.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>The wise <span class='add'>men</span> are ashamed, they are dismayed and taken: lo, they have rejected the word of the LORD; and what wisdom <span class='add'>is</span> in them?  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>Therefore will I give their wives unto others, <span class='add'>and</span> their fields to them that shall inherit <span class='add'>them:</span> for every one from the least even unto the greatest is given to covetousness, from the prophet even unto the priest every one dealeth falsely.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>For they have healed the hurt of the daughter of my people slightly, saying, Peace, peace; when <span class='add'>there is</span> no peace.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>Were they ashamed when they had committed abomination? nay, they were not at all ashamed, neither could they blush: therefore shall they fall among them that fall: in the time of their visitation they shall be cast down, saith the LORD. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>I will surely consume them, saith the LORD: <span class='add'>there shall be</span> no grapes on the vine, nor figs on the fig tree, and the leaf shall fade; and <span class='add'>the things that</span> I have given them shall pass away from them.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>Why do we sit still? assemble yourselves, and let us enter into the defenced cities, and let us be silent there: for the LORD our God hath put us to silence, and given us water of gall to drink, because we have sinned against the LORD.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>We looked for peace, but no good <span class='add'>came; and</span> for a time of health, and behold trouble!  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>The snorting of his horses was heard from Dan: the whole land trembled at the sound of the neighing of his strong ones; for they are come, and have devoured the land, and all that is in it; the city, and those that dwell therein.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>For, behold, I will send serpents, cockatrices, among you, which <span class='add'>will</span> not <span class='add'>be</span> charmed, and they shall bite you, saith the LORD. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span> <span class='add'>When</span> I would comfort myself against sorrow, my heart <span class='add'>is</span> faint in me.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>Behold the voice of the cry of the daughter of my people because of them that dwell in a far country: <span class='add'>Is</span> not the LORD in Zion? <span class='add'>is</span> not her king in her?
