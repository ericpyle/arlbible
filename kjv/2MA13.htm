<div class="chapterlabel"> 13</div><div class="p">
 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C13V1">&nbsp;</a>In the hundred forty and ninth year it was told Judas, that Antiochus Eupator was coming with a great
power into Judea,
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C13V2">&nbsp;</a>And with him Lysias his protector, and ruler of his affairs, having either of them a Grecian power of
footmen, an hundred and ten thousand, and horsemen five thousand and three hundred, and elephants two
and twenty, and three hundred chariots armed with hooks.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C13V3">&nbsp;</a>Menelaus also joined himself with them, and with great dissimulation encouraged Antiochus, not for the
safeguard of the country, but because he thought to have been made governor.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C13V4">&nbsp;</a>But the King of kings moved Antiochus’ mind against this wicked wretch, and Lysias informed the king
that this man was the cause of all mischief, so that the king commanded to bring him unto Berea, and
to put him to death, as the manner is in that place.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C13V5">&nbsp;</a>Now there was in that place a tower of fifty cubits high, full of ashes, and it had a round instrument
which on every side hanged down into the ashes.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C13V6">&nbsp;</a>And whosoever was condemned of sacrilege, or had committed any other grievous crime, there did all men
thrust him unto death.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C13V7">&nbsp;</a>Such a death it happened that wicked man to die, not having so much as burial in the earth; and that
most justly:
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C13V8">&nbsp;</a>For inasmuch as he had committed many sins about the altar, whose fire and ashes were holy, he received
his death in ashes.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C13V9">&nbsp;</a>Now the king came with a barbarous and haughty mind to do far worse to the Jews, than had been done in
his father’s time.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C13V10">&nbsp;</a>Which things when Judas perceived, he commanded the multitude to call upon the Lord night and day, that
if ever at any other time, he would now also help them, being at the point to be put from their law,
from their country, and from the holy temple:
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C13V11">&nbsp;</a>And that he would not suffer the people, that had even now been but a little refreshed, to be in subjection
to the blasphemous nations.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C13V12">&nbsp;</a>So when they had all done this together, and besought the merciful Lord with weeping and fasting, and
lying flat upon the ground three days long, Judas, having exhorted them, commanded they should be in
a readiness.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C13V13">&nbsp;</a>And Judas, being apart with the elders, determined, before the king’s host should enter into Judea, and
get the city, to go forth and try the matter in fight by the help of the Lord.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C13V14">&nbsp;</a>So when he had committed all to the Creator of the world, and exhorted his soldiers to fight manfully,
even unto death, for the laws, the temple, the city, the country, and the commonwealth, he camped by
Modin:
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C13V15">&nbsp;</a>And having given the watchword to them that were about him, Victory is of God; with the most valiant
and choice young men he went in into the king’s tent by night, and slew in the camp about four thousand
men, and the chiefest of the elephants, with all that were upon him.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C13V16">&nbsp;</a>And at last they filled the camp with fear and tumult, and departed with good success.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C13V17">&nbsp;</a>This was done in the break of the day, because the protection of the Lord did help him.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C13V18">&nbsp;</a>Now when the king had taken a taste of the manliness of the Jews, he went about to take the holds by
policy,
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C13V19">&nbsp;</a>And marched toward Bethsura, which was a strong hold of the Jews: but he was put to flight, failed, and
lost of his men:
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C13V20">&nbsp;</a>For Judas had conveyed unto them that were in it such things as were necessary.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C13V21">&nbsp;</a>But Rhodocus, who was in the Jews’ host, disclosed the secrets to the enemies; therefore he was sought
out, and when they had gotten him, they put him in prison.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C13V22">&nbsp;</a>The king treated with them in Bethsum the second time, gave his hand, took their’s, departed, fought
with Judas, was overcome;
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C13V23">&nbsp;</a>Heard that Philip, who was left over the affairs in Antioch, was desperately bent, confounded, intreated
the Jews, submitted himself, and sware to all equal conditions, agreed with them, and offered sacrifice,
honoured the temple, and dealt kindly with the place,
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C13V24">&nbsp;</a>And accepted well of Maccabeus, made him principal governor from Ptolemais unto the Gerrhenians;
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C13V25">&nbsp;</a>Came to Ptolemais: the people there were grieved for the covenants; for they stormed, because they would
make their covenants void:
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C13V26">&nbsp;</a>Lysias went up to the judgment seat, said as much as could be in defence of the cause, persuaded, pacified,
made them well affected, returned to Antioch. Thus it went touching the king’s coming and departing.
