<div><a name="C48V0"><hr></a>
<div class="chapterlabel"> 48</div><div class="p">
 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C48V1">&nbsp;</a>Then stood up Elias the prophet as fire, and his word burned like a lamp.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C48V2">&nbsp;</a>He brought a sore famine upon them, and by his zeal he diminished their number.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C48V3">&nbsp;</a>By the word of the Lord he shut up the heaven, and also three times brought down fire.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C48V4">&nbsp;</a>O Elias, how wast thou honoured in thy wondrous deeds! and who may glory like unto thee!
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C48V5">&nbsp;</a>Who didst raise up a dead man from death, and his soul from the place of the dead, by the word of the
most High:
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C48V6">&nbsp;</a>Who broughtest kings to destruction, and honorable men from their bed:
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C48V7">&nbsp;</a>Who heardest the rebuke of the Lord in Sinai, and in Horeb the judgment of vengeance:
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C48V8">&nbsp;</a>Who annointedst kings to take revenge, and prophets to succeed after him:
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C48V9">&nbsp;</a>Who was taken up in a whirlwind of fire, and in a chariot of fiery horses:
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C48V10">&nbsp;</a>Who wast ordained for reproofs in their times, to pacify the wrath of the Lord’s judgment, before it
brake forth into fury, and to turn the heart of the father unto the son, and to restore the tribes of
Jacob.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C48V11">&nbsp;</a>Blessed are they that saw thee, and slept in love; for we shall surely live.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C48V12">&nbsp;</a>Elias it was, who was covered with a whirlwind: and Eliseus was filled with his spirit: whilst he lived,
he was not moved with the presence of any prince, neither could any bring him into subjection.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C48V13">&nbsp;</a>No word could overcome him; and after his death his body prophesied.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C48V14">&nbsp;</a>He did wonders in his life, and at his death were his works marvellous.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C48V15">&nbsp;</a>For all this the people repented not, neither departed they from their sins, till they were spoiled and
carried out of their land, and were scattered through all the earth: yet there remained a small people,
and a ruler in the house of David:
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C48V16">&nbsp;</a>Of whom some did that which was pleasing to God, and some multiplied sins.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C48V17">&nbsp;</a>Ezekias fortified his city, and brought in water into the midst thereof: he digged the hard rock with
iron, and made wells for waters.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C48V18">&nbsp;</a>In his time Sennacherib came up, and sent Rabsaces, and lifted up his hand against Sion, and boasted
proudly.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C48V19">&nbsp;</a>Then trembled their hearts and hands, and they were in pain, as women in travail.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C48V20">&nbsp;</a>But they called upon the Lord which is merciful, and stretched out their hands toward him: and immediately
the Holy One heard them out of heaven, and delivered them by the ministry of Esay.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C48V21">&nbsp;</a>He smote the host of the Assyrians, and his angel destroyed them.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C48V22">&nbsp;</a>For Ezekias had done the thing that pleased the Lord, and was strong in the ways of David his father,
as Esay the prophet, who was great and faithful in his vision, had commanded him.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C48V23">&nbsp;</a>In his time the sun went backward, and he lengthened the king’s life.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C48V24">&nbsp;</a>He saw by an excellent spirit what should come to pass at the last, and he comforted them that mourned
in Sion.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C48V25">&nbsp;</a>He shewed what should come to pass for ever, and secret things or ever they came.
