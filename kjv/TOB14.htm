<div class="chapterlabel"> 14</div><div class="p">
 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C14V1">&nbsp;</a>So Tobit made an end of praising God.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C14V2">&nbsp;</a>And he was eight and fifty years old when he lost his sight, which was restored to him after eight years:
and he gave alms, and he increased in the fear of the Lord God, and praised him.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C14V3">&nbsp;</a>And when he was very aged he called his son, and the sons of his son, and said to him, My son, take thy
children; for, behold, I am aged, and am ready to depart out of this life.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C14V4">&nbsp;</a>Go into Media my son, for I surely believe those things which Jonas the prophet spake of Nineve, that
it shall be overthrown; and that for a time peace shall rather be in Media; and that our brethren shall
lie scattered in the earth from that good land: and Jerusalem shall be desolate, and the house of God
in it shall be burned, and shall be desolate for a time;
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C14V5">&nbsp;</a>And that again God will have mercy on them, and bring them again into the land, where they shall build
a temple, but not like to the first, until the time of that age be fulfilled; and afterward they shall
return from all places of their captivity, and build up Jerusalem gloriously, and the house of God shall
be built in it for ever with a glorious building, as the prophets have spoken thereof.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C14V6">&nbsp;</a>And all nations shall turn, and fear the Lord God truly, and shall bury their idols.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C14V7">&nbsp;</a>So shall all nations praise the Lord, and his people shall confess God, and the Lord shall exalt his
people; and all those which love the Lord God in truth and justice shall rejoice, shewing mercy to our
brethren.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C14V8">&nbsp;</a>And now, my son, depart out of Nineve, because that those things which the prophet Jonas spake shall
surely come to pass.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C14V9">&nbsp;</a>But keep thou the law and the commandments, and shew thyself merciful and just, that it may go well with
thee.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C14V10">&nbsp;</a>And bury me decently, and thy mother with me; but tarry no longer at Nineve. Remember, my son, how Aman
handled Achiacharus that brought him up, how out of light he brought him into darkness, and how he rewarded
him again: yet Achiacharus was saved, but the other had his reward: for he went down into darkness. Manasses
gave alms, and escaped the snares of death which they had set for him: but Aman fell into the snare,
and perished.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C14V11">&nbsp;</a>Wherefore now, my son, consider what alms doeth, and how righteousness doth deliver. When he had said
these things, he gave up the ghost in the bed, being an hundred and eight and fifty years old; and he
buried him honourably.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C14V12">&nbsp;</a>And when Anna his mother was dead, he buried her with his father. But Tobias departed with his wife and
children to Ecbatane to Raguel his father in law,
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C14V13">&nbsp;</a>Where he became old with honour, and he buried his father and mother in law honourably, and he inherited
their substance, and his father Tobit’s.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C14V14">&nbsp;</a>And he died at Ecbatane in Media, being an hundred and seven and twenty years old.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C14V15">&nbsp;</a>But before he died he heard of the destruction of Nineve, which was taken by Nabuchodonosor and Assuerus:
and before his death he rejoiced over Nineve.
