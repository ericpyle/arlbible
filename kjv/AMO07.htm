And I said, A plumbline. Then said the Lord, Behold, I will set a plumbline in the midst of my people Israel: I will not again pass by them any more:  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>And the high places of Isaac shall be desolate, and the sanctuaries of Israel shall be laid waste; and I will rise against the house of Jeroboam with the sword. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>Then Amaziah the priest of Beth-el sent to Jeroboam king of Israel, saying, Amos hath conspired against thee in the midst of the house of Israel: the land is not able to bear all his words.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>For thus Amos saith, Jeroboam shall die by the sword, and Israel shall surely be led away captive out of their own land.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>Also Amaziah said unto Amos, O thou seer, go, flee thee away into the land of Judah, and there eat bread, and prophesy there:  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>But prophesy not again any more at Beth-el: for it <span class='add'>is</span> the king’s chapel, and it <span class='add'>is</span> the king’s court. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>Then answered Amos, and said to Amaziah, I <span class='add'>was</span> no prophet, neither <span class='add'>was</span> I a prophet’s son; but I <span class='add'>was</span> an herdman, and a gatherer of sycomore fruit:  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>And the LORD took me as I followed the flock, and the LORD said unto me, Go, prophesy unto my people Israel. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>Now therefore hear thou the word of the LORD: Thou sayest, Prophesy not against Israel, and drop not <span class='add'>thy word</span> against the house of Isaac.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>Therefore thus saith the LORD; Thy wife shall be an harlot in the city, and thy sons and thy daughters shall fall by the sword, and thy land shall be divided by line; and thou shalt die in a polluted land: and Israel shall surely go into captivity forth of his land. </div><ul class='tnav'>
