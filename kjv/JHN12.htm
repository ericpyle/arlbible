 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C12V1">&nbsp;</a>Then Jesus six days before the passover came to Bethany, where Lazarus was which had been dead, whom
he raised from the dead.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C12V2">&nbsp;</a>There they made him a supper; and Martha served: but Lazarus was one of them that sat at the table with
him.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C12V3">&nbsp;</a>Then took Mary a pound of ointment of spikenard, very costly, and anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped
his feet with her hair: and the house was filled with the odour of the ointment.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C12V4">&nbsp;</a>Then saith one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot, Simon’s
<span class="add">son,
</span> which should betray him,
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C12V5">&nbsp;</a>Why was not this ointment sold for three hundred pence, and given to the poor?
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C12V6">&nbsp;</a>This he said, not that he cared for the poor; but because he was a thief, and had the bag, and bare what
was put therein.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C12V7">&nbsp;</a>Then said Jesus,
<span class="wj">Let her alone: against the day of my burying hath she kept this.
</span> <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C12V8">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">For the poor always ye have with you; but me ye have not always.
</span> <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C12V9">&nbsp;</a>Much people of the Jews therefore knew that he was there: and they came not for Jesus’ sake only, but
that they might see Lazarus also, whom he had raised from the dead.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C12V10">&nbsp;</a>But the chief priests consulted that they might put Lazarus also to death;
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C12V11">&nbsp;</a>Because that by reason of him many of the Jews went away, and believed on Jesus.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C12V12">&nbsp;</a>On the next day much people that were come to the feast, when they heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem,
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C12V13">&nbsp;</a>Took branches of palm trees, and went forth to meet him, and cried, Hosanna: Blessed
<span class="add">is</span> the King of Israel that cometh in the name of the Lord.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C12V14">&nbsp;</a>And Jesus, when he had found a young ass, sat thereon; as it is written,
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C12V15">&nbsp;</a>Fear not, daughter of Sion: behold, thy King cometh, sitting on an ass’s colt.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C12V16">&nbsp;</a>These things understood not his disciples at the first: but when Jesus was glorified, then remembered
they that these things were written of him, and
<span class="add">that</span> they had done these things unto him.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C12V17">&nbsp;</a>The people therefore that was with him when he called Lazarus out of his grave, and raised him from the
dead, bare record.
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C12V18">&nbsp;</a>For this cause the people also met him, for that they heard that he had done this miracle.
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C12V19">&nbsp;</a>The Pharisees therefore said among themselves, Perceive ye how ye prevail nothing? behold, the world
is gone after him.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C12V20">&nbsp;</a>And there were certain Greeks among them that came up to worship at the feast:
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C12V21">&nbsp;</a>The same came therefore to Philip, which was of Bethsaida of Galilee, and desired him, saying, Sir, we
would see Jesus.
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C12V22">&nbsp;</a>Philip cometh and telleth Andrew: and again Andrew and Philip tell Jesus.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C12V23">&nbsp;</a>And Jesus answered them, saying,
<span class="wj">The hour is come, that the Son of man should be glorified.
</span> <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C12V24">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it abideth alone:
but if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit.
</span> <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C12V25">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">He that loveth his life shall lose it; and he that hateth his life in this world shall keep it unto life
eternal.
</span> <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C12V26">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">If any man serve me, let him follow me; and where I am, there shall also my servant be: if any man serve
me, him will
</span><span class="add">my</span><span class="wj"> Father honour.
</span> <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C12V27">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Now is my soul troubled; and what shall I say? Father, save me from this hour: but for this cause came
I unto this hour.
</span> <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C12V28">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Father, glorify thy name.</span> Then came there a voice from heaven,
<span class="add">saying,</span> I have both glorified
<span class="add">it,</span> and will glorify
<span class="add">it</span> again.
 <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C12V29">&nbsp;</a>The people therefore, that stood by, and heard
<span class="add">it,</span> said that it thundered: others said, An angel spake to him.
 <span class="verse"> 30</span><a name="C12V30">&nbsp;</a>Jesus answered and said,
<span class="wj">This voice came not because of me, but for your sakes.
</span> <span class="verse"> 31</span><a name="C12V31">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Now is the judgment of this world: now shall the prince of this world be cast out.
</span> <span class="verse"> 32</span><a name="C12V32">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all
</span><span class="add">men
</span><span class="wj"> unto me.
</span> <span class="verse"> 33</span><a name="C12V33">&nbsp;</a>This he said, signifying what death he should die.
 <span class="verse"> 34</span><a name="C12V34">&nbsp;</a>The people answered him, We have heard out of the law that Christ abideth for ever: and how sayest thou,
<span class="wj">The Son of man must be lifted up?
</span> who is this Son of man?
 <span class="verse"> 35</span><a name="C12V35">&nbsp;</a>Then Jesus said unto them,
<span class="wj">Yet a little while is the light with you. Walk while ye have the light, lest darkness come upon you:
for he that walketh in darkness knoweth not whither he goeth.
</span> <span class="verse"> 36</span><a name="C12V36">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">While ye have light, believe in the light, that ye may be the children of light.</span> These things spake Jesus, and departed, and did hide himself from them.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 37</span><a name="C12V37">&nbsp;</a>But though he had done so many miracles before them, yet they believed not on him:
 <span class="verse"> 38</span><a name="C12V38">&nbsp;</a>That the saying of Esaias the prophet might be fulfilled, which he spake, Lord, who hath believed our
report? and to whom hath the arm of the Lord been revealed?
 <span class="verse"> 39</span><a name="C12V39">&nbsp;</a>Therefore they could not believe, because that Esaias said again,
 <span class="verse"> 40</span><a name="C12V40">&nbsp;</a>He hath blinded their eyes, and hardened their heart; that they should not see with
<span class="add">their</span> eyes, nor understand with
<span class="add">their</span> heart, and be converted, and I should heal them.
 <span class="verse"> 41</span><a name="C12V41">&nbsp;</a>These things said Esaias, when he saw his glory, and spake of him.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 42</span><a name="C12V42">&nbsp;</a>Nevertheless among the chief rulers also many believed on him; but because of the Pharisees they did
not confess
<span class="add">him,</span> lest they should be put out of the synagogue:
 <span class="verse"> 43</span><a name="C12V43">&nbsp;</a>For they loved the praise of men more than the praise of God.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 44</span><a name="C12V44">&nbsp;</a>Jesus cried and said,
<span class="wj">He that believeth on me, believeth not on me, but on him that sent me.
</span> <span class="verse"> 45</span><a name="C12V45">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And he that seeth me seeth him that sent me.
</span> <span class="verse"> 46</span><a name="C12V46">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">I am come a light into the world, that whosoever believeth on me should not abide in darkness.
</span> <span class="verse"> 47</span><a name="C12V47">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And if any man hear my words, and believe not, I judge him not: for I came not to judge the world, but
to save the world.
</span> <span class="verse"> 48</span><a name="C12V48">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">He that rejecteth me, and receiveth not my words, hath one that judgeth him: the word that I have spoken,
the same shall judge him in the last day.
</span> <span class="verse"> 49</span><a name="C12V49">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">For I have not spoken of myself; but the Father which sent me, he gave me a commandment, what I should
say, and what I should speak.
</span> <span class="verse"> 50</span><a name="C12V50">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And I know that his commandment is life everlasting: whatsoever I speak therefore, even as the Father
said unto me, so I speak.</span></div>
