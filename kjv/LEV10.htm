 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C10V1">&nbsp;</a>And Nadab and Abihu, the sons of Aaron, took either of them his censer, and put fire therein, and put
incense thereon, and offered strange fire before the LORD, which he commanded them not.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C10V2">&nbsp;</a>And there went out fire from the LORD, and devoured them, and they died before the LORD.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C10V3">&nbsp;</a>Then Moses said unto Aaron, This
<span class="add">is it</span> that the LORD spake, saying, I will be sanctified in them that come nigh me, and before all the people
I will be glorified. And Aaron held his peace.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C10V4">&nbsp;</a>And Moses called Mishael and Elzaphan, the sons of Uzziel the uncle of Aaron, and said unto them, Come
near, carry your brethren from before the sanctuary out of the camp.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C10V5">&nbsp;</a>So they went near, and carried them in their coats out of the camp; as Moses had said.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C10V6">&nbsp;</a>And Moses said unto Aaron, and unto Eleazar and unto Ithamar, his sons, Uncover not your heads, neither
rend your clothes; lest ye die, and lest wrath come upon all the people: but let your brethren, the whole
house of Israel, bewail the burning which the LORD hath kindled.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C10V7">&nbsp;</a>And ye shall not go out from the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, lest ye die: for the anointing
oil of the LORD
<span class="add">is
</span> upon you. And they did according to the word of Moses.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C10V8">&nbsp;</a>And the LORD spake unto Aaron, saying,
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C10V9">&nbsp;</a>Do not drink wine nor strong drink, thou, nor thy sons with thee, when ye go into the tabernacle of the
congregation, lest ye die:
<span class="add">it shall be
</span> a statute for ever throughout your generations:
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C10V10">&nbsp;</a>And that ye may put difference between holy and unholy, and between unclean and clean;
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C10V11">&nbsp;</a>And that ye may teach the children of Israel all the statutes which the LORD hath spoken unto them by
the hand of Moses.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C10V12">&nbsp;</a>And Moses spake unto Aaron, and unto Eleazar and unto Ithamar, his sons that were left, Take the meat
offering that remaineth of the offerings of the LORD made by fire, and eat it without leaven beside the
altar: for it
<span class="add">is</span> most holy:
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C10V13">&nbsp;</a>And ye shall eat it in the holy place, because it
<span class="add">is</span> thy due, and thy sons’ due, of the sacrifices of the LORD made by fire: for so I am commanded.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C10V14">&nbsp;</a>And the wave breast and heave shoulder shall ye eat in a clean place; thou, and thy sons, and thy daughters
with thee: for
<span class="add">they be</span> thy due, and thy sons’ due,
<span class="add">which</span> are given out of the sacrifices of peace offerings of the children of Israel.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C10V15">&nbsp;</a>The heave shoulder and the wave breast shall they bring with the offerings made by fire of the fat, to
wave
<span class="add">it for</span> a wave offering before the LORD; and it shall be thine, and thy sons’ with thee, by a statute for ever;
as the LORD hath commanded.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C10V16">&nbsp;</a>And Moses diligently sought the goat of the sin offering, and, behold, it was burnt: and he was angry
with Eleazar and Ithamar, the sons of Aaron
<span class="add">which were</span> left
<span class="add">alive,</span> saying,
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C10V17">&nbsp;</a>Wherefore have ye not eaten the sin offering in the holy place, seeing it
<span class="add">is</span> most holy, and
<span class="add">God</span> hath given it you to bear the iniquity of the congregation, to make atonement for them before the LORD?
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C10V18">&nbsp;</a>Behold, the blood of it was not brought in within the holy
<span class="add">place:
</span> ye should indeed have eaten it in the holy
<span class="add">place,</span> as I commanded.
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C10V19">&nbsp;</a>And Aaron said unto Moses, Behold, this day have they offered their sin offering and their burnt offering
before the LORD; and such things have befallen me: and
<span class="add">if</span> I had eaten the sin offering to day, should it have been accepted in the sight of the LORD?
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C10V20">&nbsp;</a>And when Moses heard
<span class="add">that,</span> he was content.
