 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C3V1">&nbsp;</a>I
<span class="add">am</span> the man
<span class="add">that</span> hath seen affliction by the rod of his wrath.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C3V2">&nbsp;</a>He hath led me, and brought
<span class="add">me into</span> darkness, but not
<span class="add">into</span> light.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C3V3">&nbsp;</a>Surely against me is he turned; he turneth his hand
<span class="add">against me</span> all the day.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C3V4">&nbsp;</a>My flesh and my skin hath he made old; he hath broken my bones.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C3V5">&nbsp;</a>He hath builded against me, and compassed
<span class="add">me</span> with gall and travail.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C3V6">&nbsp;</a>He hath set me in dark places, as
<span class="add">they that be</span> dead of old.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C3V7">&nbsp;</a>He hath hedged me about, that I cannot get out: he hath made my chain heavy.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C3V8">&nbsp;</a>Also when I cry and shout, he shutteth out my prayer.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C3V9">&nbsp;</a>He hath inclosed my ways with hewn stone, he hath made my paths crooked.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C3V10">&nbsp;</a>He
<span class="add">was</span> unto me
<span class="add">as</span> a bear lying in wait,
<span class="add">and as</span> a lion in secret places.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C3V11">&nbsp;</a>He hath turned aside my ways, and pulled me in pieces: he hath made me desolate.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C3V12">&nbsp;</a>He hath bent his bow, and set me as a mark for the arrow.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C3V13">&nbsp;</a>He hath caused the arrows of his quiver to enter into my reins.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C3V14">&nbsp;</a>I was a derision to all my people;
<span class="add">and</span> their song all the day.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C3V15">&nbsp;</a>He hath filled me with bitterness, he hath made me drunken with wormwood.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C3V16">&nbsp;</a>He hath also broken my teeth with gravel stones, he hath covered me with ashes.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C3V17">&nbsp;</a>And thou hast removed my soul far off from peace: I forgat prosperity.
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C3V18">&nbsp;</a>And I said, My strength and my hope is perished from the LORD:
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C3V19">&nbsp;</a>Remembering mine affliction and my misery, the wormwood and the gall.
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C3V20">&nbsp;</a>My soul hath
<span class="add">them</span> still in remembrance, and is humbled in me.
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C3V21">&nbsp;</a>This I recall to my mind, therefore have I hope.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C3V22">&nbsp;</a><span class="add">It is of</span> the LORD’S mercies that we are not consumed, because his compassions fail not.
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C3V23">&nbsp;</a><span class="add">They are</span> new every morning: great
<span class="add">is</span> thy faithfulness.
 <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C3V24">&nbsp;</a>The LORD
<span class="add">is</span> my portion, saith my soul; therefore will I hope in him.
 <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C3V25">&nbsp;</a>The LORD
<span class="add">is</span> good unto them that wait for him, to the soul
<span class="add">that</span> seeketh him.
 <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C3V26">&nbsp;</a><span class="add">It is</span> good that
<span class="add">a man</span> should both hope and quietly wait for the salvation of the LORD.
 <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C3V27">&nbsp;</a><span class="add">It is</span> good for a man that he bear the yoke in his youth.
 <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C3V28">&nbsp;</a>He sitteth alone and keepeth silence, because he hath borne it upon him.
 <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C3V29">&nbsp;</a>He putteth his mouth in the dust; if so be there may be hope.
 <span class="verse"> 30</span><a name="C3V30">&nbsp;</a>He giveth
<span class="add">his</span> cheek to him that smiteth him: he is filled full with reproach.
 <span class="verse"> 31</span><a name="C3V31">&nbsp;</a>For the Lord will not cast off for ever:
 <span class="verse"> 32</span><a name="C3V32">&nbsp;</a>But though he cause grief, yet will he have compassion according to the multitude of his mercies.
 <span class="verse"> 33</span><a name="C3V33">&nbsp;</a>For he doth not afflict willingly nor grieve the children of men.
 <span class="verse"> 34</span><a name="C3V34">&nbsp;</a>To crush under his feet all the prisoners of the earth,
 <span class="verse"> 35</span><a name="C3V35">&nbsp;</a>To turn aside the right of a man before the face of the most High,
 <span class="verse"> 36</span><a name="C3V36">&nbsp;</a>To subvert a man in his cause, the Lord approveth not.
 <span class="verse"> 37</span><a name="C3V37">&nbsp;</a>Who
<span class="add">is</span> he
<span class="add">that</span> saith, and it cometh to pass,
<span class="add">when</span> the Lord commandeth
<span class="add">it</span> not?
 <span class="verse"> 38</span><a name="C3V38">&nbsp;</a>Out of the mouth of the most High proceedeth not evil and good?
 <span class="verse"> 39</span><a name="C3V39">&nbsp;</a>Wherefore doth a living man complain, a man for the punishment of his sins?
 <span class="verse"> 40</span><a name="C3V40">&nbsp;</a>Let us search and try our ways, and turn again to the LORD.
 <span class="verse"> 41</span><a name="C3V41">&nbsp;</a>Let us lift up our heart with
<span class="add">our</span> hands unto God in the heavens.
 <span class="verse"> 42</span><a name="C3V42">&nbsp;</a>We have transgressed and have rebelled: thou hast not pardoned.
 <span class="verse"> 43</span><a name="C3V43">&nbsp;</a>Thou hast covered with anger, and persecuted us: thou hast slain, thou hast not pitied.
 <span class="verse"> 44</span><a name="C3V44">&nbsp;</a>Thou hast covered thyself with a cloud, that
<span class="add">our</span> prayer should not pass through.
 <span class="verse"> 45</span><a name="C3V45">&nbsp;</a>Thou hast made us
<span class="add">as</span> the offscouring and refuse in the midst of the people.
 <span class="verse"> 46</span><a name="C3V46">&nbsp;</a>All our enemies have opened their mouths against us.
 <span class="verse"> 47</span><a name="C3V47">&nbsp;</a>Fear and a snare is come upon us, desolation and destruction.
 <span class="verse"> 48</span><a name="C3V48">&nbsp;</a>Mine eye runneth down with rivers of water for the destruction of the daughter of my people.
 <span class="verse"> 49</span><a name="C3V49">&nbsp;</a>Mine eye trickleth down, and ceaseth not, without any intermission,
 <span class="verse"> 50</span><a name="C3V50">&nbsp;</a>Till the LORD look down, and behold from heaven.
 <span class="verse"> 51</span><a name="C3V51">&nbsp;</a>Mine eye affecteth mine heart because of all the daughters of my city.
 <span class="verse"> 52</span><a name="C3V52">&nbsp;</a>Mine enemies chased me sore, like a bird, without cause.
 <span class="verse"> 53</span><a name="C3V53">&nbsp;</a>They have cut off my life in the dungeon, and cast a stone upon me.
 <span class="verse"> 54</span><a name="C3V54">&nbsp;</a>Waters flowed over mine head;
<span class="add">then</span> I said, I am cut off.
 <span class="verse"> 55</span><a name="C3V55">&nbsp;</a>I called upon thy name, O LORD, out of the low dungeon.
 <span class="verse"> 56</span><a name="C3V56">&nbsp;</a>Thou hast heard my voice: hide not thine ear at my breathing, at my cry.
 <span class="verse"> 57</span><a name="C3V57">&nbsp;</a>Thou drewest near in the day
<span class="add">that</span> I called upon thee: thou saidst, Fear not.
 <span class="verse"> 58</span><a name="C3V58">&nbsp;</a>O Lord, thou hast pleaded the causes of my soul; thou hast redeemed my life.
 <span class="verse"> 59</span><a name="C3V59">&nbsp;</a>O LORD, thou hast seen my wrong: judge thou my cause.
 <span class="verse"> 60</span><a name="C3V60">&nbsp;</a>Thou hast seen all their vengeance
<span class="add">and</span> all their imaginations against me.
 <span class="verse"> 61</span><a name="C3V61">&nbsp;</a>Thou hast heard their reproach, O LORD,
<span class="add">and</span> all their imaginations against me;
 <span class="verse"> 62</span><a name="C3V62">&nbsp;</a>The lips of those that rose up against me, and their device against me all the day.
 <span class="verse"> 63</span><a name="C3V63">&nbsp;</a>Behold their sitting down, and their rising up; I
<span class="add">am</span> their musick.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 64</span><a name="C3V64">&nbsp;</a>Render unto them a recompence, O LORD, according to the work of their hands.
 <span class="verse"> 65</span><a name="C3V65">&nbsp;</a>Give them sorrow of heart, thy curse unto them.
 <span class="verse"> 66</span><a name="C3V66">&nbsp;</a>Persecute and destroy them in anger from under the heavens of the LORD.
