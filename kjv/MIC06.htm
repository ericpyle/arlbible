 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C6V1">&nbsp;</a>Hear ye now what the LORD saith; Arise, contend thou before the mountains, and let the hills hear thy
voice.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C6V2">&nbsp;</a>Hear ye, O mountains, the LORD’S controversy, and ye strong foundations of the earth: for the LORD hath
a controversy with his people, and he will plead with Israel.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C6V3">&nbsp;</a>O my people, what have I done unto thee? and wherein have I wearied thee? testify against me.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C6V4">&nbsp;</a>For I brought thee up out of the land of Egypt, and redeemed thee out of the house of servants; and I
sent before thee Moses, Aaron, and Miriam.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C6V5">&nbsp;</a>O my people, remember now what Balak king of Moab consulted, and what Balaam the son of Beor answered
him from Shittim unto Gilgal; that ye may know the righteousness of the LORD.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C6V6">&nbsp;</a>Wherewith shall I come before the LORD,
<span class="add">and</span> bow myself before the high God? shall I come before him with burnt offerings, with calves of a year
old?
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C6V7">&nbsp;</a>Will the LORD be pleased with thousands of rams,
<span class="add">or</span> with ten thousands of rivers of oil? shall I give my firstborn
<span class="add">for</span> my transgression, the fruit of my body
<span class="add">for</span> the sin of my soul?
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C6V8">&nbsp;</a>He hath shewed thee, O man, what
<span class="add">is</span> good; and what doth the LORD require of thee, but to do justly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly
with thy God?
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C6V9">&nbsp;</a>The LORD’S voice crieth unto the city, and
<span class="add">the man of</span> wisdom shall see thy name: hear ye the rod, and who hath appointed it.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C6V10">&nbsp;</a>Are there yet the treasures of wickedness in the house of the wicked, and the scant measure
<span class="add">that is</span> abominable?
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C6V11">&nbsp;</a>Shall I count
<span class="add">them</span> pure with the wicked balances, and with the bag of deceitful weights?
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C6V12">&nbsp;</a>For the rich men thereof are full of violence, and the inhabitants thereof have spoken lies, and their
tongue
<span class="add">is</span> deceitful in their mouth.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C6V13">&nbsp;</a>Therefore also will I make
<span class="add">thee</span> sick in smiting thee, in making
<span class="add">thee</span> desolate because of thy sins.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C6V14">&nbsp;</a>Thou shalt eat, but not be satisfied; and thy casting down
<span class="add">shall be</span> in the midst of thee; and thou shalt take hold, but shalt not deliver; and
<span class="add">that</span> which thou deliverest will I give up to the sword.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C6V15">&nbsp;</a>Thou shalt sow, but thou shalt not reap; thou shalt tread the olives, but thou shalt not anoint thee
with oil; and sweet wine, but shalt not drink wine.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C6V16">&nbsp;</a>For the statutes of Omri are kept, and all the works of the house of Ahab, and ye walk in their counsels;
that I should make thee a desolation, and the inhabitants thereof an hissing: therefore ye shall bear
the reproach of my people.
