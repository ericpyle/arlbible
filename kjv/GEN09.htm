 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C9V1">&nbsp;</a>And God blessed Noah and his sons, and said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C9V2">&nbsp;</a>And the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast of the earth, and upon every fowl
of the air, upon all that moveth
<span class="add">upon</span> the earth, and upon all the fishes of the sea; into your hand are they delivered.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C9V3">&nbsp;</a>Every moving thing that liveth shall be meat for you; even as the green herb have I given you all things.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C9V4">&nbsp;</a>But flesh with the life thereof,
<span class="add">which is</span> the blood thereof, shall ye not eat.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C9V5">&nbsp;</a>And surely your blood of your lives will I require; at the hand of every beast will I require it, and
at the hand of man; at the hand of every man’s brother will I require the life of man.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C9V6">&nbsp;</a>Whoso sheddeth man’s blood, by man shall his blood be shed: for in the image of God made he man.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C9V7">&nbsp;</a>And you, be ye fruitful, and multiply; bring forth abundantly in the earth, and multiply therein.

<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C9V8">&nbsp;</a>And God spake unto Noah, and to his sons with him, saying,
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C9V9">&nbsp;</a>And I, behold, I establish my covenant with you, and with your seed after you;
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C9V10">&nbsp;</a>And with every living creature that
<span class="add">is</span> with you, of the fowl, of the cattle, and of every beast of the earth with you; from all that go out
of the ark, to every beast of the earth.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C9V11">&nbsp;</a>And I will establish my covenant with you; neither shall all flesh be cut off any more by the waters
of a flood; neither shall there any more be a flood to destroy the earth.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C9V12">&nbsp;</a>And God said, This
<span class="add">is</span> the token of the covenant which I make between me and you and every living creature that
<span class="add">is</span> with you, for perpetual generations:
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C9V13">&nbsp;</a>I do set my bow in the cloud, and it shall be for a token of a covenant between me and the earth.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C9V14">&nbsp;</a>And it shall come to pass, when I bring a cloud over the earth, that the bow shall be seen in the cloud:
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C9V15">&nbsp;</a>And I will remember my covenant, which
<span class="add">is</span> between me and you and every living creature of all flesh; and the waters shall no more become a flood
to destroy all flesh.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C9V16">&nbsp;</a>And the bow shall be in the cloud; and I will look upon it, that I may remember the everlasting covenant
between God and every living creature of all flesh that
<span class="add">is</span> upon the earth.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C9V17">&nbsp;</a>And God said unto Noah, This
<span class="add">is</span> the token of the covenant, which I have established between me and all flesh that
<span class="add">is</span> upon the earth.

<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C9V18">&nbsp;</a>And the sons of Noah, that went forth of the ark, were Shem, and Ham, and Japheth: and Ham is the father
of Canaan.
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C9V19">&nbsp;</a>These
<span class="add">are</span> the three sons of Noah: and of them was the whole earth overspread.
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C9V20">&nbsp;</a>And Noah began
<span class="add">to be</span> an husbandman, and he planted a vineyard:
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C9V21">&nbsp;</a>And he drank of the wine, and was drunken; and he was uncovered within his tent.
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C9V22">&nbsp;</a>And Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his father, and told his two brethren without.
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C9V23">&nbsp;</a>And Shem and Japheth took a garment, and laid
<span class="add">it</span> upon both their shoulders, and went backward, and covered the nakedness of their father; and their faces
<span class="add">were</span> backward, and they saw not their father’s nakedness.
 <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C9V24">&nbsp;</a>And Noah awoke from his wine, and knew what his younger son had done unto him.
 <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C9V25">&nbsp;</a>And he said, Cursed
<span class="add">be</span> Canaan; a servant of servants shall he be unto his brethren.
 <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C9V26">&nbsp;</a>And he said, Blessed
<span class="add">be</span> the LORD God of Shem; and Canaan shall be his servant.
 <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C9V27">&nbsp;</a>God shall enlarge Japheth, and he shall dwell in the tents of Shem; and Canaan shall be his servant.
