 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C34V1">&nbsp;</a>And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C34V2">&nbsp;</a>Son of man, prophesy against the shepherds of Israel, prophesy, and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord
GOD unto the shepherds; Woe
<span class="add">be</span> to the shepherds of Israel that do feed themselves! should not the shepherds feed the flocks?
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C34V3">&nbsp;</a>Ye eat the fat, and ye clothe you with the wool, ye kill them that are fed:
<span class="add">but</span> ye feed not the flock.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C34V4">&nbsp;</a>The diseased have ye not strengthened, neither have ye healed that which was sick, neither have ye bound
up
<span class="add">that which was</span> broken, neither have ye brought again that which was driven away, neither have ye sought that which
was lost; but with force and with cruelty have ye ruled them.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C34V5">&nbsp;</a>And they were scattered, because
<span class="add">there is</span> no shepherd: and they became meat to all the beasts of the field, when they were scattered.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C34V6">&nbsp;</a>My sheep wandered through all the mountains, and upon every high hill: yea, my flock was scattered upon
all the face of the earth, and none did search or seek
<span class="add">after them.</span></div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C34V7">&nbsp;</a>Therefore, ye shepherds, hear the word of the LORD;
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C34V8">&nbsp;</a><span class="add">As</span> I live, saith the Lord GOD, surely because my flock became a prey, and my flock became meat to every
beast of the field, because
<span class="add">there was</span> no shepherd, neither did my shepherds search for my flock, but the shepherds fed themselves, and fed
not my flock;
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C34V9">&nbsp;</a>Therefore, O ye shepherds, hear the word of the LORD;
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C34V10">&nbsp;</a>Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I
<span class="add">am</span> against the shepherds; and I will require my flock at their hand, and cause them to cease from feeding
the flock; neither shall the shepherds feed themselves any more; for I will deliver my flock from their
mouth, that they may not be meat for them.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C34V11">&nbsp;</a>For thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I,
<span class="add">even</span> I, will both search my sheep, and seek them out.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C34V12">&nbsp;</a>As a shepherd seeketh out his flock in the day that he is among his sheep
<span class="add">that are</span> scattered; so will I seek out my sheep, and will deliver them out of all places where they have been
scattered in the cloudy and dark day.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C34V13">&nbsp;</a>And I will bring them out from the people, and gather them from the countries, and will bring them to
their own land, and feed them upon the mountains of Israel by the rivers, and in all the inhabited places
of the country.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C34V14">&nbsp;</a>I will feed them in a good pasture, and upon the high mountains of Israel shall their fold be: there
shall they lie in a good fold, and
<span class="add">in</span> a fat pasture shall they feed upon the mountains of Israel.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C34V15">&nbsp;</a>I will feed my flock, and I will cause them to lie down, saith the Lord GOD.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C34V16">&nbsp;</a>I will seek that which was lost, and bring again that which was driven away, and will bind up
<span class="add">that which was</span> broken, and will strengthen that which was sick: but I will destroy the fat and the strong; I will feed
them with judgment.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C34V17">&nbsp;</a>And
<span class="add">as for</span> you, O my flock, thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I judge between cattle and cattle, between the rams
and the he goats.
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C34V18">&nbsp;</a><span class="add">Seemeth it</span> a small thing unto you to have eaten up the good pasture, but ye must tread down with your feet the
residue of your pastures? and to have drunk of the deep waters, but ye must foul the residue with your
feet?
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C34V19">&nbsp;</a>And
<span class="add">as for</span> my flock, they eat that which ye have trodden with your feet; and they drink that which ye have fouled
with your feet.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C34V20">&nbsp;</a>Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD unto them; Behold, I,
<span class="add">even
</span> I, will judge between the fat cattle and between the lean cattle.
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C34V21">&nbsp;</a>Because ye have thrust with side and with shoulder, and pushed all the diseased with your horns, till
ye have scattered them abroad;
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C34V22">&nbsp;</a>Therefore will I save my flock, and they shall no more be a prey; and I will judge between cattle and
cattle.
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C34V23">&nbsp;</a>And I will set up one shepherd over them, and he shall feed them,
<span class="add">even</span> my servant David; he shall feed them, and he shall be their shepherd.
 <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C34V24">&nbsp;</a>And I the LORD will be their God, and my servant David a prince among them; I the LORD have spoken
<span class="add">it.
</span> <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C34V25">&nbsp;</a>And I will make with them a covenant of peace, and will cause the evil beasts to cease out of the land:
and they shall dwell safely in the wilderness, and sleep in the woods.
 <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C34V26">&nbsp;</a>And I will make them and the places round about my hill a blessing; and I will cause the shower to come
down in his season; there shall be showers of blessing.
 <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C34V27">&nbsp;</a>And the tree of the field shall yield her fruit, and the earth shall yield her increase, and they shall
be safe in their land, and shall know that I
<span class="add">am</span> the LORD, when I have broken the bands of their yoke, and delivered them out of the hand of those that
served themselves of them.
 <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C34V28">&nbsp;</a>And they shall no more be a prey to the heathen, neither shall the beast of the land devour them; but
they shall dwell safely, and none shall make
<span class="add">them</span> afraid.
 <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C34V29">&nbsp;</a>And I will raise up for them a plant of renown, and they shall be no more consumed with hunger in the
land, neither bear the shame of the heathen any more.
 <span class="verse"> 30</span><a name="C34V30">&nbsp;</a>Thus shall they know that I the LORD their God
<span class="add">am</span> with them, and
<span class="add">that</span> they,
<span class="add">even</span> the house of Israel,
<span class="add">are
</span> my people, saith the Lord GOD.
 <span class="verse"> 31</span><a name="C34V31">&nbsp;</a>And ye my flock, the flock of my pasture,
<span class="add">are</span> men,
<span class="add">and
</span> I
<span class="add">am</span> your God, saith the Lord GOD.
