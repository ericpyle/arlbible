 <span class="verse" id="V1">1&nbsp;</span>Then I looked, and, behold, in the firmament that was above the head of the cherubims there appeared over them as it were a sapphire stone, as the appearance of the likeness of a throne.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span>And he spake unto the man clothed with linen, and said, Go in between the wheels, <span class='add'>even</span> under the cherub, and fill thine hand with coals of fire from between the cherubims, and scatter <span class='add'>them</span> over the city. And he went in in my sight.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>Now the cherubims stood on the right side of the house, when the man went in; and the cloud filled the inner court.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>Then the glory of the LORD went up from the cherub, <span class='add'>and stood</span> over the threshold of the house; and the house was filled with the cloud, and the court was full of the brightness of the LORD’s glory.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>And the sound of the cherubims’ wings was heard <span class='add'>even</span> to the outer court, as the voice of the Almighty God when he speaketh.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>And it came to pass, <span class='add'>that</span> when he had commanded the man clothed with linen, saying, Take fire from between the wheels, from between the cherubims; then he went in, and stood beside the wheels.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>And <span class='add'>one</span> cherub stretched forth his hand from between the cherubims unto the fire that <span class='add'>was</span> between the cherubims, and took <span class='add'>thereof</span>, and put <span class='add'>it</span> into the hands of <span class='add'>him that was</span> clothed with linen: who took <span class='add'>it</span>, and went out. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>And there appeared in the cherubims the form of a man’s hand under their wings.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>And when I looked, behold the four wheels by the cherubims, one wheel by one cherub, and another wheel by another cherub: and the appearance of the wheels <span class='add'>was</span> as the colour of a beryl stone.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>And <span class='add'>as for</span> their appearances, they four had one likeness, as if a wheel had been in the midst of a wheel.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>When they went, they went upon their four sides; they turned not as they went, but to the place whither the head looked they followed it; they turned not as they went.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>And their whole body, and their backs, and their hands, and their wings, and the wheels, <span class='add'>were</span> full of eyes round about, <span class='add'>even</span> the wheels that they four had.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>As for the wheels, it was cried unto them in my hearing, O wheel.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>And every one had four faces: the first face <span class='add'>was</span> the face of a cherub, and the second face <span class='add'>was</span> the face of a man, and the third the face of a lion, and the fourth the face of an eagle.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>And the cherubims were lifted up. This <span class='add'>is</span> the living creature that I saw by the river of Chebar.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>And when the cherubims went, the wheels went by them: and when the cherubims lifted up their wings to mount up from the earth, the same wheels also turned not from beside them.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>When they stood, <span class='add'>these</span> stood; and when they were lifted up, <span class='add'>these</span> lifted up themselves <span class='add'>also:</span> for the spirit of the living creature <span class='add'>was</span> in them.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>Then the glory of the LORD departed from off the threshold of the house, and stood over the cherubims.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>And the cherubims lifted up their wings, and mounted up from the earth in my sight: when they went out, the wheels also <span class='add'>were</span> beside them, and <span class='add'>every one</span> stood at the door of the east gate of the LORD’s house; and the glory of the God of Israel <span class='add'>was</span> over them above.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>This <span class='add'>is</span> the living creature that I saw under the God of Israel by the river of Chebar; and I knew that they <span class='add'>were</span> the cherubims.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>Every one had four faces apiece, and every one four wings; and the likeness of the hands of a man <span class='add'>was</span> under their wings.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>And the likeness of their faces <span class='add'>was</span> the same faces which I saw by the river of Chebar, their appearances and themselves: they went every one straight forward. </div><ul class='tnav'>
