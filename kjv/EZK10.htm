 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C10V1">&nbsp;</a>Then I looked, and, behold, in the firmament that was above the head of the cherubims there appeared
over them as it were a sapphire stone, as the appearance of the likeness of a throne.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C10V2">&nbsp;</a>And he spake unto the man clothed with linen, and said, Go in between the wheels,
<span class="add">even</span> under the cherub, and fill thine hand with coals of fire from between the cherubims, and scatter
<span class="add">them</span> over the city. And he went in in my sight.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C10V3">&nbsp;</a>Now the cherubims stood on the right side of the house, when the man went in; and the cloud filled the
inner court.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C10V4">&nbsp;</a>Then the glory of the LORD went up from the cherub,
<span class="add">and stood
</span> over the threshold of the house; and the house was filled with the cloud, and the court was full of
the brightness of the LORD’S glory.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C10V5">&nbsp;</a>And the sound of the cherubims’ wings was heard
<span class="add">even</span> to the outer court, as the voice of the Almighty God when he speaketh.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C10V6">&nbsp;</a>And it came to pass,
<span class="add">that</span> when he had commanded the man clothed with linen, saying, Take fire from between the wheels, from between
the cherubims; then he went in, and stood beside the wheels.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C10V7">&nbsp;</a>And
<span class="add">one</span> cherub stretched forth his hand from between the cherubims unto the fire that
<span class="add">was</span> between the cherubims, and took
<span class="add">thereof,</span> and put
<span class="add">it</span> into the hands of
<span class="add">him that was
</span> clothed with linen: who took
<span class="add">it,</span> and went out.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C10V8">&nbsp;</a>And there appeared in the cherubims the form of a man’s hand under their wings.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C10V9">&nbsp;</a>And when I looked, behold the four wheels by the cherubims, one wheel by one cherub, and another wheel
by another cherub: and the appearance of the wheels
<span class="add">was</span> as the colour of a beryl stone.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C10V10">&nbsp;</a>And
<span class="add">as for</span> their appearances, they four had one likeness, as if a wheel had been in the midst of a wheel.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C10V11">&nbsp;</a>When they went, they went upon their four sides; they turned not as they went, but to the place whither
the head looked they followed it; they turned not as they went.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C10V12">&nbsp;</a>And their whole body, and their backs, and their hands, and their wings, and the wheels,
<span class="add">were</span> full of eyes round about,
<span class="add">even</span> the wheels that they four had.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C10V13">&nbsp;</a>As for the wheels, it was cried unto them in my hearing, O wheel.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C10V14">&nbsp;</a>And every one had four faces: the first face
<span class="add">was</span> the face of a cherub, and the second face
<span class="add">was</span> the face of a man, and the third the face of a lion, and the fourth the face of an eagle.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C10V15">&nbsp;</a>And the cherubims were lifted up. This
<span class="add">is</span> the living creature that I saw by the river of Chebar.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C10V16">&nbsp;</a>And when the cherubims went, the wheels went by them: and when the cherubims lifted up their wings to
mount up from the earth, the same wheels also turned not from beside them.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C10V17">&nbsp;</a>When they stood,
<span class="add">these</span> stood; and when they were lifted up,
<span class="add">these</span> lifted up themselves
<span class="add">also:</span> for the spirit of the living creature
<span class="add">was</span> in them.
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C10V18">&nbsp;</a>Then the glory of the LORD departed from off the threshold of the house, and stood over the cherubims.
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C10V19">&nbsp;</a>And the cherubims lifted up their wings, and mounted up from the earth in my sight: when they went out,
the wheels also
<span class="add">were</span> beside them, and
<span class="add">every one</span> stood at the door of the east gate of the LORD’S house; and the glory of the God of Israel
<span class="add">was</span> over them above.
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C10V20">&nbsp;</a>This
<span class="add">is</span> the living creature that I saw under the God of Israel by the river of Chebar; and I knew that they
<span class="add">were</span> the cherubims.
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C10V21">&nbsp;</a>Every one had four faces apiece, and every one four wings; and the likeness of the hands of a man
<span class="add">was</span> under their wings.
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C10V22">&nbsp;</a>And the likeness of their faces
<span class="add">was</span> the same faces which I saw by the river of Chebar, their appearances and themselves: they went every
one straight forward.
