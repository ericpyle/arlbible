 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C3V1">&nbsp;</a>And the word of the LORD came unto Jonah the second time, saying,
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C3V2">&nbsp;</a>Arise, go unto Nineveh, that great city, and preach unto it the preaching that I bid thee.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C3V3">&nbsp;</a>So Jonah arose, and went unto Nineveh, according to the word of the LORD. Now Nineveh was an exceeding
great city of three days’ journey.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C3V4">&nbsp;</a>And Jonah began to enter into the city a day’s journey, and he cried, and said, Yet forty days, and Nineveh
shall be overthrown.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C3V5">&nbsp;</a>So the people of Nineveh believed God, and proclaimed a fast, and put on sackcloth, from the greatest
of them even to the least of them.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C3V6">&nbsp;</a>For word came unto the king of Nineveh, and he arose from his throne, and he laid his robe from him,
and covered
<span class="add">him</span> with sackcloth, and sat in ashes.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C3V7">&nbsp;</a>And he caused
<span class="add">it</span> to be proclaimed and published through Nineveh by the decree of the king and his nobles, saying, Let
neither man nor beast, herd nor flock, taste any thing: let them not feed, nor drink water:
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C3V8">&nbsp;</a>But let man and beast be covered with sackcloth, and cry mightily unto God: yea, let them turn every
one from his evil way, and from the violence that
<span class="add">is</span> in their hands.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C3V9">&nbsp;</a>Who can tell
<span class="add">if</span> God will turn and repent, and turn away from his fierce anger, that we perish not?
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C3V10">&nbsp;</a>And God saw their works, that they turned from their evil way; and God repented of the evil, that he
had said that he would do unto them; and he did
<span class="add">it</span> not.
