 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C39V2">&nbsp;</a>And he made the ephod
<span class="add">of</span> gold, blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C39V3">&nbsp;</a>And they did beat the gold into thin plates, and cut

<span class="add">it</span> in the blue, and in the purple, and in the scarlet, and in the fine linen,
<span class="add">with</span> cunning work.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C39V4">&nbsp;</a>They made shoulderpieces for it, to couple
<span class="add">it</span> together: by the two edges was it coupled together.

 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C39V15">&nbsp;</a>And they made upon the breastplate chains at the ends,
<span class="add">of
</span> wreathen work
<span class="add">of</span> pure gold.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C39V16">&nbsp;</a>And they made two ouches

against the
<span class="add">other</span> coupling thereof, above the curious girdle of the ephod.
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C39V21">&nbsp;</a>And they did bind the breastplate by his rings unto the rings of the ephod with a lace of blue, that
it might be above the curious girdle of the ephod, and that the breastplate might not be loosed from
the ephod; as the LORD commanded Moses.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C39V22">&nbsp;</a>And he made the robe of the ephod

<span class="add">with</span> a band round about the hole, that it should not rend.
 <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C39V24">&nbsp;</a>And they made upon the hems of the robe pomegranates
<span class="add">of</span> blue, and purple, and scarlet,
<span class="add">and</span> twined
<span class="add">linen.
</span> <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C39V25">&nbsp;</a>And they made bells
<span class="add">of</span> pure gold, and put the bells between the pomegranates upon the hem of the robe, round about between
the pomegranates;
 <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C39V26">&nbsp;</a>A bell and a pomegranate, a bell and a pomegranate, round about the hem of the robe to minister
