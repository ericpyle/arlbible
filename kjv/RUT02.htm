<div class="chapterlabel"> 2</div><div class="p">
 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C2V1">&nbsp;</a>And Naomi had a kinsman of her husband’s, a mighty man of wealth, of the family of Elimelech; and his
name
<span class="add">was</span> Boaz.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C2V2">&nbsp;</a>And Ruth the Moabitess said unto Naomi, Let me now go to the field, and glean ears of corn after
<span class="add">him</span> in whose sight I shall find grace. And she said unto her, Go, my daughter.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C2V3">&nbsp;</a>And she went, and came, and gleaned in the field after the reapers: and her hap was to light on a part
of the field
<span class="add">belonging</span> unto Boaz, who
<span class="add">was</span> of the kindred of Elimelech.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C2V4">&nbsp;</a>And behold, Boaz came from Bethlehem, and said unto the reapers, The LORD
<span class="add">be</span> with you. And they answered him, The LORD bless thee.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C2V5">&nbsp;</a>Then said Boaz unto his servant that was set over the reapers, Whose damsel
<span class="add">is</span> this?
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C2V6">&nbsp;</a>And the servant that was set over the reapers answered and said, It
<span class="add">is</span> the Moabitish damsel that came back with Naomi out of the country of Moab:
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C2V7">&nbsp;</a>And she said, I pray you, let me glean and gather after the reapers among the sheaves: so she came, and
hath continued even from the morning until now, that she tarried a little in the house.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C2V8">&nbsp;</a>Then said Boaz unto Ruth, Hearest thou not, my daughter? Go not to glean in another field, neither go
from hence, but abide here fast by my maidens:
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C2V9">&nbsp;</a><span class="add">Let</span> thine eyes
<span class="add">be</span> on the field that they do reap, and go thou after them: have I not charged the young men that they shall
not touch thee? and when thou art athirst, go unto the vessels, and drink of
<span class="add">that
</span> which the young men have drawn.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C2V10">&nbsp;</a>Then she fell on her face, and bowed herself to the ground, and said unto him, Why have I found grace
in thine eyes, that thou shouldest take knowledge of me, seeing I
<span class="add">am</span> a stranger?
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C2V11">&nbsp;</a>And Boaz answered and said unto her, It hath fully been shewed me, all that thou hast done unto thy mother
in law since the death of thine husband: and
<span class="add">how</span> thou hast left thy father and thy mother, and the land of thy nativity, and art come unto a people which
thou knewest not heretofore.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C2V12">&nbsp;</a>The LORD recompense thy work, and a full reward be given thee of the LORD God of Israel, under whose
wings thou art come to trust.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C2V13">&nbsp;</a>Then she said, Let me find favour in thy sight, my lord; for that thou hast comforted me, and for that
thou hast spoken friendly unto thine handmaid, though I be not like unto one of thine handmaidens.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C2V14">&nbsp;</a>And Boaz said unto her, At mealtime come thou hither, and eat of the bread, and dip thy morsel in the
vinegar. And she sat beside the reapers: and he reached her parched
<span class="add">corn,</span> and she did eat, and was sufficed, and left.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C2V15">&nbsp;</a>And when she was risen up to glean, Boaz commanded his young men, saying, Let her glean even among the
sheaves, and reproach her not:
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C2V16">&nbsp;</a>And let fall also
<span class="add">some</span> of the handfuls of purpose for her, and leave
<span class="add">them,</span> that she may glean
<span class="add">them,</span> and rebuke her not.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C2V17">&nbsp;</a>So she gleaned in the field until even, and beat out that she had gleaned: and it was about an ephah
of barley.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C2V18">&nbsp;</a>And she took
<span class="add">it</span> up, and went into the city: and her mother in law saw what she had gleaned: and she brought forth, and
gave to her that she had reserved after she was sufficed.
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C2V19">&nbsp;</a>And her mother in law said unto her, Where hast thou gleaned to day? and where wroughtest thou? blessed
be he that did take knowledge of thee. And she shewed her mother in law with whom she had wrought, and
said, The man’s name with whom I wrought to day
<span class="add">is</span> Boaz.
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C2V20">&nbsp;</a>And Naomi said unto her daughter in law, Blessed
<span class="add">be</span> he of the LORD, who hath not left off his kindness to the living and to the dead. And Naomi said unto
her, The man
<span class="add">is</span> near of kin unto us, one of our next kinsmen.
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C2V21">&nbsp;</a>And Ruth the Moabitess said, He said unto me also, Thou shalt keep fast by my young men, until they have
ended all my harvest.
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C2V22">&nbsp;</a>And Naomi said unto Ruth her daughter in law,
<span class="add">It is</span> good, my daughter, that thou go out with his maidens, that they meet thee not in any other field.
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C2V23">&nbsp;</a>So she kept fast by the maidens of Boaz to glean unto the end of barley harvest and of wheat harvest;
and dwelt with her mother in law.
