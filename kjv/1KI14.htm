 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C14V1">&nbsp;</a>At that time Abijah the son of Jeroboam fell sick.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C14V2">&nbsp;</a>And Jeroboam said to his wife, Arise, I pray thee, and disguise thyself, that thou be not known to be
the wife of Jeroboam; and get thee to Shiloh: behold, there
<span class="add">is</span> Ahijah the prophet, which told me that
<span class="add">I should be</span> king over this people.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C14V3">&nbsp;</a>And take with thee ten loaves, and cracknels, and a cruse of honey, and go to him: he shall tell thee
what shall become of the child.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C14V4">&nbsp;</a>And Jeroboam’s wife did so, and arose, and went to Shiloh, and came to the house of Ahijah. But Ahijah
could not see; for his eyes were set by reason of his age.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C14V5">&nbsp;</a>And the LORD said unto Ahijah, Behold, the wife of Jeroboam cometh to ask a thing of thee for her son;
for he is sick: thus and thus shalt thou say unto her: for it shall be, when she cometh in, that she
shall feign herself
<span class="add">to be</span> another
<span class="add">woman.
</span> <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C14V6">&nbsp;</a>And it was
<span class="add">so,</span> when Ahijah heard the sound of her feet as she came in at the door, that he said, Come in, thou wife
of Jeroboam; why feignest thou thyself
<span class="add">to be</span> another? for I
<span class="add">am</span> sent to thee
<span class="add">with</span> heavy
<span class="add">tidings.
</span> <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C14V7">&nbsp;</a>Go, tell Jeroboam, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Forasmuch as I exalted thee from among the people,
and made thee prince over my people Israel,
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C14V8">&nbsp;</a>And rent the kingdom away from the house of David, and gave it thee: and yet thou hast not been as my
servant David, who kept my commandments, and who followed me with all his heart, to do
<span class="add">that</span> only
<span class="add">which was
</span> right in mine eyes;
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C14V9">&nbsp;</a>But hast done evil above all that were before thee: for thou hast gone and made thee other gods, and
molten images, to provoke me to anger, and hast cast me behind thy back:
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C14V10">&nbsp;</a>Therefore, behold, I will bring evil upon the house of Jeroboam, and will cut off from Jeroboam him that
pisseth against the wall,
<span class="add">and
</span> him that is shut up and left in Israel, and will take away the remnant of the house of Jeroboam, as
a man taketh away dung, till it be all gone.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C14V11">&nbsp;</a>Him that dieth of Jeroboam in the city shall the dogs eat; and him that dieth in the field shall the
fowls of the air eat: for the LORD hath spoken it.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C14V12">&nbsp;</a>Arise thou therefore, get thee to thine own house:
<span class="add">and</span> when thy feet enter into the city, the child shall die.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C14V13">&nbsp;</a>And all Israel shall mourn for him, and bury him: for he only of Jeroboam shall come to the grave, because
in him there is found
<span class="add">some
</span> good thing toward the LORD God of Israel in the house of Jeroboam.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C14V14">&nbsp;</a>Moreover the LORD shall raise him up a king over Israel, who shall cut off the house of Jeroboam that
day: but what? even now.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C14V15">&nbsp;</a>For the LORD shall smite Israel, as a reed is shaken in the water, and he shall root up Israel out of
this good land, which he gave to their fathers, and shall scatter them beyond the river, because they
have made their groves, provoking the LORD to anger.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C14V16">&nbsp;</a>And he shall give Israel up because of the sins of Jeroboam, who did sin, and who made Israel to sin.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C14V17">&nbsp;</a>And Jeroboam’s wife arose, and departed, and came to Tirzah:
<span class="add">and
</span> when she came to the threshold of the door, the child died;
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C14V18">&nbsp;</a>And they buried him; and all Israel mourned for him, according to the word of the LORD, which he spake
by the hand of his servant Ahijah the prophet.
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C14V19">&nbsp;</a>And the rest of the acts of Jeroboam, how he warred, and how he reigned, behold, they
<span class="add">are</span> written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel.
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C14V20">&nbsp;</a>And the days which Jeroboam reigned
<span class="add">were</span> two and twenty years: and he slept with his fathers, and Nadab his son reigned in his stead.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C14V21">&nbsp;</a>And Rehoboam the son of Solomon reigned in Judah. Rehoboam
<span class="add">was
</span> forty and one years old when he began to reign, and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city
which the LORD did choose out of all the tribes of Israel, to put his name there. And his mother’s name
<span class="add">was</span> Naamah an Ammonitess.
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C14V22">&nbsp;</a>And Judah did evil in the sight of the LORD, and they provoked him to jealousy with their sins which
they had committed, above all that their fathers had done.
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C14V23">&nbsp;</a>For they also built them high places, and images, and groves, on every high hill, and under every green
tree.
 <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C14V24">&nbsp;</a>And there were also sodomites in the land:
<span class="add">and</span> they did according to all the abominations of the nations which the LORD cast out before the children
of Israel.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C14V25">&nbsp;</a>And it came to pass in the fifth year of king Rehoboam,
<span class="add">that
</span> Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem:
 <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C14V26">&nbsp;</a>And he took away the treasures of the house of the LORD, and the treasures of the king’s house; he even
took away all: and he took away all the shields of gold which Solomon had made.
 <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C14V27">&nbsp;</a>And king Rehoboam made in their stead brasen shields, and committed
<span class="add">them</span> unto the hands of the chief of the guard, which kept the door of the king’s house.
 <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C14V28">&nbsp;</a>And it was
<span class="add">so,</span> when the king went into the house of the LORD, that the guard bare them, and brought them back into
the guard chamber.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C14V29">&nbsp;</a>Now the rest of the acts of Rehoboam, and all that he did,
<span class="add">are
</span> they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?
 <span class="verse"> 30</span><a name="C14V30">&nbsp;</a>And there was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all
<span class="add">their
</span> days.
 <span class="verse"> 31</span><a name="C14V31">&nbsp;</a>And Rehoboam slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David. And his mother’s
name
<span class="add">was</span> Naamah an Ammonitess. And Abijam his son reigned in his stead.
