 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C10V1">&nbsp;</a>Woe unto them that decree unrighteous decrees, and that write grievousness
<span class="add">which</span> they have prescribed;
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C10V2">&nbsp;</a>To turn aside the needy from judgment, and to take away the right from the poor of my people, that widows
may be their prey, and
<span class="add">that</span> they may rob the fatherless!
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C10V3">&nbsp;</a>And what will ye do in the day of visitation, and in the desolation
<span class="add">which</span> shall come from far? to whom will ye flee for help? and where will ye leave your glory?
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C10V4">&nbsp;</a>Without me they shall bow down under the prisoners, and they shall fall under the slain. For all this
his anger is not turned away, but his hand
<span class="add">is</span> stretched out still.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C10V5">&nbsp;</a>O Assyrian, the rod of mine anger, and the staff in their hand is mine indignation.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C10V6">&nbsp;</a>I will send him against an hypocritical nation, and against the people of my wrath will I give him a
charge, to take the spoil, and to take the prey, and to tread them down like the mire of the streets.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C10V7">&nbsp;</a>Howbeit he meaneth not so, neither doth his heart think so; but
<span class="add">it is</span> in his heart to destroy and cut off nations not a few.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C10V8">&nbsp;</a>For he saith,
<span class="add">Are</span> not my princes altogether kings?
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C10V9">&nbsp;</a><span class="add">Is</span> not Calno as Carchemish?
<span class="add">is</span> not Hamath as Arpad?
<span class="add">is</span> not Samaria as Damascus?
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C10V10">&nbsp;</a>As my hand hath found the kingdoms of the idols, and whose graven images did excel them of Jerusalem
and of Samaria;
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C10V11">&nbsp;</a>Shall I not, as I have done unto Samaria and her idols, so do to Jerusalem and her idols?
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C10V12">&nbsp;</a>Wherefore it shall come to pass,
<span class="add">that</span> when the Lord hath performed his whole work upon mount Zion and on Jerusalem, I will punish the fruit
of the stout heart of the king of Assyria, and the glory of his high looks.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C10V13">&nbsp;</a>For he saith, By the strength of my hand I have done
<span class="add">it,</span> and by my wisdom; for I am prudent: and I have removed the bounds of the people, and have robbed their
treasures, and I have put down the inhabitants like a valiant
<span class="add">man:
</span> <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C10V14">&nbsp;</a>And my hand hath found as a nest the riches of the people: and as one gathereth eggs
<span class="add">that are</span> left, have I gathered all the earth; and there was none that moved the wing, or opened the mouth, or
peeped.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C10V15">&nbsp;</a>Shall the axe boast itself against him that heweth therewith?
<span class="add">or</span> shall the saw magnify itself against him that shaketh it? as if the rod should shake
<span class="add">itself</span> against them that lift it up,
<span class="add">or</span> as if the staff should lift up
<span class="add">itself, as if it were</span> no wood.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C10V16">&nbsp;</a>Therefore shall the Lord, the Lord of hosts, send among his fat ones leanness; and under his glory he
shall kindle a burning like the burning of a fire.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C10V17">&nbsp;</a>And the light of Israel shall be for a fire, and his Holy One for a flame: and it shall burn and devour
his thorns and his briers in one day;
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C10V18">&nbsp;</a>And shall consume the glory of his forest, and of his fruitful field, both soul and body: and they shall
be as when a standardbearer fainteth.
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C10V19">&nbsp;</a>And the rest of the trees of his forest shall be few, that a child may write them.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C10V20">&nbsp;</a>And it shall come to pass in that day,
<span class="add">that</span> the remnant of Israel, and such as are escaped of the house of Jacob, shall no more again stay upon
him that smote them; but shall stay upon the LORD, the Holy One of Israel, in truth.
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C10V21">&nbsp;</a>The remnant shall return,
<span class="add">even</span> the remnant of Jacob, unto the mighty God.
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C10V22">&nbsp;</a>For though thy people Israel be as the sand of the sea,
<span class="add">yet</span> a remnant of them shall return: the consumption decreed shall overflow with righteousness.
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C10V23">&nbsp;</a>For the Lord GOD of hosts shall make a consumption, even determined, in the midst of all the land.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C10V24">&nbsp;</a>Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD of hosts, O my people that dwellest in Zion, be not afraid of the Assyrian:
he shall smite thee with a rod, and shall lift up his staff against thee, after the manner of Egypt.
 <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C10V25">&nbsp;</a>For yet a very little while, and the indignation shall cease, and mine anger in their destruction.
 <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C10V26">&nbsp;</a>And the LORD of hosts shall stir up a scourge for him according to the slaughter of Midian at the rock
of Oreb: and
<span class="add">as</span> his rod
<span class="add">was</span> upon the sea, so shall he lift it up after the manner of Egypt.
 <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C10V27">&nbsp;</a>And it shall come to pass in that day,
<span class="add">that</span> his burden shall be taken away from off thy shoulder, and his yoke from off thy neck, and the yoke shall
be destroyed because of the anointing.
 <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C10V28">&nbsp;</a>He is come to Aiath, he is passed to Migron; at Michmash he hath laid up his carriages:
 <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C10V29">&nbsp;</a>They are gone over the passage: they have taken up their lodging at Geba; Ramah is afraid; Gibeah of
Saul is fled.
 <span class="verse"> 30</span><a name="C10V30">&nbsp;</a>Lift up thy voice, O daughter of Gallim: cause it to be heard unto Laish, O poor Anathoth.
 <span class="verse"> 31</span><a name="C10V31">&nbsp;</a>Madmenah is removed; the inhabitants of Gebim gather themselves to flee.
 <span class="verse"> 32</span><a name="C10V32">&nbsp;</a>As yet shall he remain at Nob that day: he shall shake his hand
<span class="add">against</span> the mount of the daughter of Zion, the hill of Jerusalem.
 <span class="verse"> 33</span><a name="C10V33">&nbsp;</a>Behold, the Lord, the LORD of hosts, shall lop the bough with terror: and the high ones of stature
<span class="add">shall be</span> hewn down, and the haughty shall be humbled.
 <span class="verse"> 34</span><a name="C10V34">&nbsp;</a>And he shall cut down the thickets of the forest with iron, and Lebanon shall fall by a mighty one.
