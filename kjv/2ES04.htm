<div class="chapterlabel"> 4</div><div class="p">
 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C4V1">&nbsp;</a>And the angel that was sent unto me, whose name was Uriel, gave me an answer,
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C4V2">&nbsp;</a>And said, Thy heart hath gone to far in this world, and thinkest thou to comprehend the way of the most
High?
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C4V3">&nbsp;</a>Then said I, Yea, my lord. And he answered me, and said, I am sent to shew thee three ways, and to set
forth three similitudes before thee:
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C4V4">&nbsp;</a>Whereof if thou canst declare me one, I will shew thee also the way that thou desirest to see, and I
shall shew thee from whence the wicked heart cometh.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C4V5">&nbsp;</a>And I said, Tell on, my lord. Then said he unto me, Go thy way, weigh me the weight of the fire, or measure
me the blast of the wind, or call me again the day that is past.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C4V6">&nbsp;</a>Then answered I and said, What man is able to do that, that thou shouldest ask such things of me?
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C4V7">&nbsp;</a>And he said unto me, If I should ask thee how great dwellings are in the midst of the sea, or how many
springs are in the beginning of the deep, or how many springs are above the firmament, or which are the
outgoings of paradise:
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C4V8">&nbsp;</a>Peradventure thou wouldest say unto me, I never went down into the deep, nor as yet into hell, neither
did I ever climb up into heaven.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C4V9">&nbsp;</a>Nevertheless now have I asked thee but only of the fire and wind, and of the day wherethrough thou hast
passed, and of things from which thou canst not be separated, and yet canst thou give me no answer of
them.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C4V10">&nbsp;</a>He said moreover unto me, Thine own things, and such as are grown up with thee, canst thou not know;
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C4V11">&nbsp;</a>How should thy vessel then be able to comprehend the way of the Highest, and, the world being now outwardly
corrupted to understand the corruption that is evident in my sight?
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C4V12">&nbsp;</a>Then said I unto him, It were better that we were not at all, than that we should live still in wickedness,
and to suffer, and not to know wherefore.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C4V13">&nbsp;</a>He answered me, and said, I went into a forest into a plain, and the trees took counsel,
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C4V14">&nbsp;</a>And said, Come, let us go and make war against the sea that it may depart away before us, and that we
may make us more woods.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C4V15">&nbsp;</a>The floods of the sea also in like manner took counsel, and said, Come, let us go up and subdue the woods
of the plain, that there also we may make us another country.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C4V16">&nbsp;</a>The thought of the wood was in vain, for the fire came and consumed it.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C4V17">&nbsp;</a>The thought of the floods of the sea came likewise to nought, for the sand stood up and stopped them.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C4V18">&nbsp;</a>If thou wert judge now betwixt these two, whom wouldest thou begin to justify? or whom wouldest thou
condemn?
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C4V19">&nbsp;</a>I answered and said, Verily it is a foolish thought that they both have devised, for the ground is given
unto the wood, and the sea also hath his place to bear his floods.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C4V20">&nbsp;</a>Then answered he me, and said, Thou hast given a right judgment, but why judgest thou not thyself also?
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C4V21">&nbsp;</a>For like as the ground is given unto the wood, and the sea to his floods: even so they that dwell upon
the earth may understand nothing but that which is upon the earth: and he that dwelleth above the heavens
may only understand the things that are above the height of the heavens.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C4V22">&nbsp;</a>Then answered I and said, I beseech thee, O Lord, let me have understanding:
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C4V23">&nbsp;</a>For it was not my mind to be curious of the high things, but of such as pass by us daily, namely, wherefore
Israel is given up as a reproach to the heathen, and for what cause the people whom thou hast loved is
given over unto ungodly nations, and why the law of our forefathers is brought to nought, and the written
covenants come to none effect,
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C4V24">&nbsp;</a>And we pass away out of the world as grasshoppers, and our life is astonishment and fear, and we are
not worthy to obtain mercy.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C4V25">&nbsp;</a>What will he then do unto his name whereby we are called? of these things have I asked.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C4V26">&nbsp;</a>Then answered he me, and said, The more thou searchest, the more thou shalt marvel; for the world hasteth
fast to pass away,
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C4V27">&nbsp;</a>And cannot comprehend the things that are promised to the righteous in time to come: for this world is
full of unrighteousness and infirmities.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C4V28">&nbsp;</a>But as concerning the things whereof thou askest me, I will tell thee; for the evil is sown, but the
destruction thereof is not yet come.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C4V29">&nbsp;</a>If therefore that which is sown be not turned upside down, and if the place where the evil is sown pass
not away, then cannot it come that is sown with good.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 30</span><a name="C4V30">&nbsp;</a>For the grain of evil seed hath been sown in the heart of Adam from the beginning, and how much ungodliness
hath it brought up unto this time? and how much shall it yet bring forth until the time of threshing
come?
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 31</span><a name="C4V31">&nbsp;</a>Ponder now by thyself, how great fruit of wickedness the grain of evil seed hath brought forth.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 32</span><a name="C4V32">&nbsp;</a>And when the ears shall be cut down, which are without number, how great a floor shall they fill?
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 33</span><a name="C4V33">&nbsp;</a>Then I answered and said, How, and when shall these things come to pass? wherefore are our years few
and evil?
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 34</span><a name="C4V34">&nbsp;</a>And he answered me, saying, Do not thou hasten above the most Highest: for thy haste is in vain to be
above him, for thou hast much exceeded.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 35</span><a name="C4V35">&nbsp;</a>Did not the souls also of the righteous ask question of these things in their chambers, saying, How long
shall I hope on this fashion? when cometh the fruit of the floor of our reward?
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 36</span><a name="C4V36">&nbsp;</a>And unto these things Uriel the archangel gave them answer, and said, Even when the number of seeds is
filled in you: for he hath weighed the world in the balance.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 37</span><a name="C4V37">&nbsp;</a>By measure hath he measured the times; and by number hath he numbered the times; and he doth not move
nor stir them, until the said measure be fulfilled.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 38</span><a name="C4V38">&nbsp;</a>Then answered I and said, O Lord that bearest rule, even we all are full of impiety.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 39</span><a name="C4V39">&nbsp;</a>And for our sakes peradventure it is that the floors of the righteous are not filled, because of the
sins of them that dwell upon the earth.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 40</span><a name="C4V40">&nbsp;</a>So he answered me, and said, Go thy way to a woman with child, and ask of her when she hath fulfilled
her nine months, if her womb may keep the birth any longer within her.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 41</span><a name="C4V41">&nbsp;</a>Then said I, No, Lord, that can she not. And he said unto me, In the grave the chambers of souls are
like the womb of a woman:
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 42</span><a name="C4V42">&nbsp;</a>For like as a woman that travaileth maketh haste to escape the necessity of the travail: even so do these
places haste to deliver those things that are committed unto them.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 43</span><a name="C4V43">&nbsp;</a>From the beginning, look, what thou desirest to see, it shall be shewed thee.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 44</span><a name="C4V44">&nbsp;</a>Then answered I and said, If I have found favour in thy sight, and if it be possible, and if I be meet
therefore,
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 45</span><a name="C4V45">&nbsp;</a>Shew me then whether there be more to come than is past, or more past than is to come.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 46</span><a name="C4V46">&nbsp;</a>What is past I know, but what is for to come I know not.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 47</span><a name="C4V47">&nbsp;</a>And he said unto me, Stand up upon the right side, and I shall expound the similitude unto thee.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 48</span><a name="C4V48">&nbsp;</a>So I stood, and saw, and, behold, an hot burning oven passed by before me: and it happened that when
the flame was gone by I looked, and, behold, the smoke remained still.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 49</span><a name="C4V49">&nbsp;</a>After this there passed by before me a watery cloud, and sent down much rain with a storm; and when the
stormy rain was past, the drops remained still.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 50</span><a name="C4V50">&nbsp;</a>Then said he unto me, Consider with thyself; as the rain is more than the drops, and as the fire is greater
than the smoke; but the drops and the smoke remain behind: so the quantity which is past did more exceed.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 51</span><a name="C4V51">&nbsp;</a>Then I prayed, and said, May I live, thinkest thou, until that time? or what shall happen in those days?
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 52</span><a name="C4V52">&nbsp;</a>He answered me, and said, As for the tokens whereof thou askest me, I may tell thee of them in part:
but as touching thy life, I am not sent to shew thee; for I do not know it.
