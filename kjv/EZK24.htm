 <span class="verse" id="V1">1&nbsp;</span>Again in the ninth year, in the tenth month, in the tenth <span class='add'>day</span> of the month, the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span>Son of man, write thee the name of the day, <span class='add'>even</span> of this same day: the king of Babylon set himself against Jerusalem this same day.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>And utter a parable unto the rebellious house, and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Set on a pot, set <span class='add'>it</span> on, and also pour water into it:  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>Gather the pieces thereof into it, <span class='add'>even</span> every good piece, the thigh, and the shoulder; fill <span class='add'>it</span> with the choice bones.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>Take the choice of the flock, and burn also the bones under it, <span class='add'>and</span> make it boil well, and let them seethe the bones of it therein. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>Wherefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Woe to the bloody city, to the pot whose scum is therein, and whose scum <span class='add'>is</span> not gone out of it! bring it out piece by piece; let no lot fall up on it.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>For her blood is in the midst of her; she set it upon the top of a rock; she poured it not upon the ground, to cover it with dust;  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>That it might cause fury to come up to take vengeance; I have set her blood upon the top of a rock, that it should not be covered.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Woe to the bloody city! I will even make the pile for fire great.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>Heap on wood, kindle the fire, consume the flesh, and spice it well, and let the bones be burned.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>Then set it empty upon the coals thereof, that the brass of it may be hot, and may burn, and <span class='add'>that</span> the filthiness of it may be molten in it, <span class='add'>that</span> the scum of it may be consumed.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>She hath wearied <span class='add'>herself</span> with lies, and her great scum went not forth out of her: her scum <span class='add'>shall be</span> in the fire.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>In thy filthiness <span class='add'>is</span> lewdness: because I have purged thee, and thou wast not purged, thou shalt not be purged from thy filthiness any more, till I have caused my fury to rest upon thee.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>I the LORD have spoken <span class='add'>it:</span> it shall come to pass, and I will do <span class='add'>it;</span> I will not go back, neither will I spare, neither will I repent; according to thy ways, and according to thy doings, shall they judge thee, saith the Lord GOD. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>Also the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>Son of man, behold, I take away from thee the desire of thine eyes with a stroke: yet neither shalt thou mourn nor weep, neither shall thy tears run down.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>Forbear to cry, make no mourning for the dead, bind the tire of thine head upon thee, and put on thy shoes upon thy feet, and cover not <span class='add'>thy</span> lips, and eat not the bread of men.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>So I spake unto the people in the morning: and at even my wife died; and I did in the morning as I was commanded. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>And the people said unto me, Wilt thou not tell us what these <span class='add'>things are</span> to us, that thou doest <span class='add'>so?</span>  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>Then I answered them, The word of the LORD came unto me, saying,  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>Speak unto the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will profane my sanctuary, the excellency of your strength, the desire of your eyes, and that which your soul pitieth; and your sons and your daughters whom ye have left shall fall by the sword.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>And ye shall do as I have done: ye shall not cover <span class='add'>your</span> lips, nor eat the bread of men.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>And your tires <span class='add'>shall be</span> upon your heads, and your shoes upon your feet: ye shall not mourn nor weep; but ye shall pine away for your iniquities, and mourn one toward another.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>Thus Ezekiel is unto you a sign: according to all that he hath done shall ye do: and when this cometh, ye shall know that I <span class='add'>am</span> the Lord GOD.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>Also, thou son of man, <span class='add'>shall it</span> not <span class='add'>be</span> in the day when I take from them their strength, the joy of their glory, the desire of their eyes, and that whereupon they set their minds, their sons and their daughters,  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span> <span class='add'>That</span> he that escapeth in that day shall come unto thee, to cause <span class='add'>thee</span> to hear <span class='add'>it</span> with <span class='add'>thine</span> ears?  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>In that day shall thy mouth be opened to him which is escaped, and thou shalt speak, and be no more dumb: and thou shalt be a sign unto them; and they shall know that I <span class='add'>am</span> the LORD. </div><ul class='tnav'>
