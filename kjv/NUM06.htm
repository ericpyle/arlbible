 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C6V1">&nbsp;</a>And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C6V2">&nbsp;</a>Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When either man or woman shall separate
<span class="add">themselves</span> to vow a vow of a Nazarite, to separate
<span class="add">themselves</span> unto the LORD:
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C6V3">&nbsp;</a>He shall separate
<span class="add">himself</span> from wine and strong drink, and shall drink no vinegar of wine, or vinegar of strong drink, neither
shall he drink any liquor of grapes, nor eat moist grapes, or dried.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C6V4">&nbsp;</a>All the days of his separation shall he eat nothing that is made of the vine tree, from the kernels even
to the husk.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C6V5">&nbsp;</a>All the days of the vow of his separation there shall no razor come upon his head: until the days be
fulfilled, in the which he separateth
<span class="add">himself</span> unto the LORD, he shall be holy,
<span class="add">and</span> shall let the locks of the hair of his head grow.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C6V6">&nbsp;</a>All the days that he separateth
<span class="add">himself</span> unto the LORD he shall come at no dead body.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C6V7">&nbsp;</a>He shall not make himself unclean for his father, or for his mother, for his brother, or for his sister,
when they die: because the consecration of his God
<span class="add">is</span> upon his head.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C6V8">&nbsp;</a>All the days of his separation he
<span class="add">is</span> holy unto the LORD.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C6V9">&nbsp;</a>And if any man die very suddenly by him, and he hath defiled the head of his consecration; then he shall
shave his head in the day of his cleansing, on the seventh day shall he shave it.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C6V10">&nbsp;</a>And on the eighth day he shall bring two turtles, or two young pigeons, to the priest, to the door of
the tabernacle of the congregation:
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C6V11">&nbsp;</a>And the priest shall offer the one for a sin offering, and the other for a burnt offering, and make an
atonement for him, for that he sinned by the dead, and shall hallow his head that same day.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C6V12">&nbsp;</a>And he shall consecrate unto the LORD the days of his separation, and shall bring a lamb of the first
year for a trespass offering: but the days that were before shall be lost, because his separation was
defiled.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C6V13">&nbsp;</a>And this
<span class="add">is</span> the law of the Nazarite, when the days of his separation are fulfilled: he shall be brought unto the
door of the tabernacle of the congregation:
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C6V14">&nbsp;</a>And he shall offer his offering unto the LORD, one he lamb of the first year without blemish for a burnt
offering, and one ewe lamb of the first year without blemish for a sin offering, and one ram without
blemish for peace offerings,
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C6V15">&nbsp;</a>And a basket of unleavened bread, cakes of fine flour mingled with oil, and wafers of unleavened bread
anointed with oil, and their meat offering, and their drink offerings.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C6V16">&nbsp;</a>And the priest shall bring
<span class="add">them</span> before the LORD, and shall offer his sin offering, and his burnt offering:
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C6V17">&nbsp;</a>And he shall offer the ram
<span class="add">for</span> a sacrifice of peace offerings unto the LORD, with the basket of unleavened bread: the priest shall
offer also his meat offering, and his drink offering.
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C6V18">&nbsp;</a>And the Nazarite shall shave the head of his separation
<span class="add">at</span> the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and shall take the hair of the head of his separation,
and put
<span class="add">it</span> in the fire which
<span class="add">is</span> under the sacrifice of the peace offerings.
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C6V19">&nbsp;</a>And the priest shall take the sodden shoulder of the ram, and one unleavened cake out of the basket,
and one unleavened wafer, and shall put
<span class="add">them</span> upon the hands of the Nazarite, after
<span class="add">the hair of</span> his separation is shaven:
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C6V20">&nbsp;</a>And the priest shall wave them
<span class="add">for</span> a wave offering before the LORD: this
<span class="add">is</span> holy for the priest, with the wave breast and heave shoulder: and after that the Nazarite may drink
wine.
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C6V21">&nbsp;</a>This
<span class="add">is</span> the law of the Nazarite who hath vowed,
<span class="add">and of</span> his offering unto the LORD for his separation, beside that
<span class="add">that</span> his hand shall get: according to the vow which he vowed, so he must do after the law of his separation.

<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C6V22">&nbsp;</a>And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C6V23">&nbsp;</a>Speak unto Aaron and unto his sons, saying, On this wise ye shall bless the children of Israel, saying
unto them,
 <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C6V24">&nbsp;</a>The LORD bless thee, and keep thee:
 <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C6V25">&nbsp;</a>The LORD make his face shine upon thee, and be gracious unto thee:
 <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C6V26">&nbsp;</a>The LORD lift up his countenance upon thee, and give thee peace.
 <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C6V27">&nbsp;</a>And they shall put my name upon the children of Israel; and I will bless them.
