<div class="chapterlabel"> 3</div><div class="p">
 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C3V1">&nbsp;</a>Now these
<span class="add">are</span> the nations which the LORD left, to prove Israel by them,
<span class="add">even</span> as many
<span class="add">of Israel</span> as had not known all the wars of Canaan;
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C3V2">&nbsp;</a>Only that the generations of the children of Israel might know, to teach them war, at the least such
as before knew nothing thereof;
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C3V3">&nbsp;</a><span class="add">Namely,</span> five lords of the Philistines, and all the Canaanites, and the Sidonians, and the Hivites that dwelt
in mount Lebanon, from mount Baal-hermon unto the entering in of Hamath.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C3V4">&nbsp;</a>And they were to prove Israel by them, to know whether they would hearken unto the commandments of the
LORD, which he commanded their fathers by the hand of Moses.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C3V5">&nbsp;</a>And the children of Israel dwelt among the Canaanites, Hittites, and Amorites, and Perizzites, and Hivites,
and Jebusites:
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C3V6">&nbsp;</a>And they took their daughters to be their wives, and gave their daughters to their sons, and served their
gods.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C3V7">&nbsp;</a>And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD, and forgat the LORD their God, and served
Baalim and the groves.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C3V8">&nbsp;</a>Therefore the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel, and he sold them into the hand of Chushan-rishathaim
king of Mesopotamia: and the children of Israel served Chushan-rishathaim eight years.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C3V9">&nbsp;</a>And when the children of Israel cried unto the LORD, the LORD raised up a deliverer to the children of
Israel, who delivered them,
<span class="add">even</span> Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb’s younger brother.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C3V10">&nbsp;</a>And the Spirit of the LORD came upon him, and he judged Israel, and went out to war: and the LORD delivered
Chushan- rishathaim king of Mesopotamia into his hand; and his hand prevailed against Chushan- rishathaim.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C3V11">&nbsp;</a>And the land had rest forty years. And Othniel the son of Kenaz died.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C3V12">&nbsp;</a>And the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the LORD: and the LORD strengthened Eglon the
king of Moab against Israel, because they had done evil in the sight of the LORD.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C3V13">&nbsp;</a>And he gathered unto him the children of Ammon and Amalek, and went and smote Israel, and possessed the
city of palm trees.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C3V14">&nbsp;</a>So the children of Israel served Eglon the king of Moab eighteen years.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C3V15">&nbsp;</a>But when the children of Israel cried unto the LORD, the LORD raised them up a deliverer, Ehud the son
of Gera, a Benjamite, a man lefthanded: and by him the children of Israel sent a present unto Eglon the
king of Moab.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C3V16">&nbsp;</a>But Ehud made him a dagger which had two edges, of a cubit length; and he did gird it under his raiment
upon his right thigh.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C3V17">&nbsp;</a>And he brought the present unto Eglon king of Moab: and Eglon
<span class="add">was</span> a very fat man.
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C3V18">&nbsp;</a>And when he had made an end to offer the present, he sent away the people that bare the present.
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C3V19">&nbsp;</a>But he himself turned again from the quarries that
<span class="add">were</span> by Gilgal, and said, I have a secret errand unto thee, O king: who said, Keep silence. And all that
stood by him went out from him.
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C3V20">&nbsp;</a>And Ehud came unto him; and he was sitting in a summer parlour, which he had for himself alone. And Ehud
said, I have a message from God unto thee. And he arose out of
<span class="add">his</span> seat.
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C3V21">&nbsp;</a>And Ehud put forth his left hand, and took the dagger from his right thigh, and thrust it into his belly:
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C3V22">&nbsp;</a>And the haft also went in after the blade; and the fat closed upon the blade, so that he could not draw
the dagger out of his belly; and the dirt came out.
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C3V23">&nbsp;</a>Then Ehud went forth through the porch, and shut the doors of the parlour upon him, and locked them.
 <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C3V24">&nbsp;</a>When he was gone out, his servants came; and when they saw that, behold, the doors of the parlour
<span class="add">were</span> locked, they said, Surely he covereth his feet in his summer chamber.
 <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C3V25">&nbsp;</a>And they tarried till they were ashamed: and, behold, he opened not the doors of the parlour; therefore
they took a key, and opened
<span class="add">them:
</span> and, behold, their lord
<span class="add">was</span> fallen down dead on the earth.
 <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C3V26">&nbsp;</a>And Ehud escaped while they tarried, and passed beyond the quarries, and escaped unto Seirath.
 <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C3V27">&nbsp;</a>And it came to pass, when he was come, that he blew a trumpet in the mountain of Ephraim, and the children
of Israel went down with him from the mount, and he before them.
 <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C3V28">&nbsp;</a>And he said unto them, Follow after me: for the LORD hath delivered your enemies the Moabites into your
hand. And they went down after him, and took the fords of Jordan toward Moab, and suffered not a man
to pass over.
 <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C3V29">&nbsp;</a>And they slew of Moab at that time about ten thousand men, all lusty, and all men of valour; and there
escaped not a man.
 <span class="verse"> 30</span><a name="C3V30">&nbsp;</a>So Moab was subdued that day under the hand of Israel. And the land had rest fourscore years.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 31</span><a name="C3V31">&nbsp;</a>And after him was Shamgar the son of Anath, which slew of the Philistines six hundred men with an ox
goad: and he also delivered Israel.
