 <span class="verse" id="V1">1&nbsp;</span>Now these <span class='add'>are</span> the nations which the LORD left, to prove Israel by them, <span class='add'>even</span> as many <span class='add'>of Israel</span> as had not known all the wars of Canaan;  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span>Only that the generations of the children of Israel might know, to teach them war, at the least such as before knew nothing thereof;  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span> <span class='add'>Namely</span>, five lords of the Philistines, and all the Canaanites, and the Sidonians, and the Hivites that dwelt in mount Lebanon, from mount Baal-hermon unto the entering in of Hamath.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>And they were to prove Israel by them, to know whether they would hearken unto the commandments of the LORD, which he commanded their fathers by the hand of Moses. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>And the children of Israel dwelt among the Canaanites, Hittites, and Amorites, and Perizzites, and Hivites, and Jebusites:  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>And they took their daughters to be their wives, and gave their daughters to their sons, and served their gods.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD, and forgat the LORD their God, and served Baalim and the groves. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>Therefore the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel, and he sold them into the hand of Chushan-rishathaim king of Mesopotamia: and the children of Israel served Chushan-rishathaim eight years.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>And when the children of Israel cried unto the LORD, the LORD raised up a deliverer to the children of Israel, who delivered them, <span class='add'>even</span> Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb’s younger brother.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>And the Spirit of the LORD came upon him, and he judged Israel, and went out to war: and the LORD delivered Chushan-rishathaim king of Mesopotamia into his hand; and his hand prevailed against Chushan-rishathaim.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>And the land had rest forty years. And Othniel the son of Kenaz died. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>And the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the LORD: and the LORD strengthened Eglon the king of Moab against Israel, because they had done evil in the sight of the LORD.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>And he gathered unto him the children of Ammon and Amalek, and went and smote Israel, and possessed the city of palm trees.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>So the children of Israel served Eglon the king of Moab eighteen years.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>But when the children of Israel cried unto the LORD, the LORD raised them up a deliverer, Ehud the son of Gera, a Benjamite, a man lefthanded: and by him the children of Israel sent a present unto Eglon the king of Moab.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>But Ehud made him a dagger which had two edges, of a cubit length; and he did gird it under his raiment upon his right thigh.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>And he brought the present unto Eglon king of Moab: and Eglon <span class='add'>was</span> a very fat man.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>And when he had made an end to offer the present, he sent away the people that bare the present.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>But he himself turned again from the quarries that <span class='add'>were</span> by Gilgal, and said, I have a secret errand unto thee, O king: who said, Keep silence. And all that stood by him went out from him.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>And Ehud came unto him; and he was sitting in a summer parlour, which he had for himself alone. And Ehud said, I have a message from God unto thee. And he arose out of <span class='add'>his</span> seat.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>And Ehud put forth his left hand, and took the dagger from his right thigh, and thrust it into his belly:  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>And the haft also went in after the blade; and the fat closed upon the blade, so that he could not draw the dagger out of his belly; and the dirt came out.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>Then Ehud went forth through the porch, and shut the doors of the parlour upon him, and locked them.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>When he was gone out, his servants came; and when they saw that, behold, the doors of the parlour <span class='add'>were</span> locked, they said, Surely he covereth his feet in his summer chamber.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>And they tarried till they were ashamed: and, behold, he opened not the doors of the parlour; therefore they took a key, and opened <span class='add'>them:</span> and, behold, their lord <span class='add'>was</span> fallen down dead on the earth.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>And Ehud escaped while they tarried, and passed beyond the quarries, and escaped unto Seirath.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>And it came to pass, when he was come, that he blew a trumpet in the mountain of Ephraim, and the children of Israel went down with him from the mount, and he before them.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&nbsp;</span>And he said unto them, Follow after me: for the LORD hath delivered your enemies the Moabites into your hand. And they went down after him, and took the fords of Jordan toward Moab, and suffered not a man to pass over.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&nbsp;</span>And they slew of Moab at that time about ten thousand men, all lusty, and all men of valour; and there escaped not a man.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&nbsp;</span>So Moab was subdued that day under the hand of Israel. And the land had rest fourscore years. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V31">31&nbsp;</span>And after him was Shamgar the son of Anath, which slew of the Philistines six hundred men with an ox goad: and he also delivered Israel. </div><ul class='tnav'>
