<div class="chapterlabel"> 2</div><div class="p">
 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C2V1">&nbsp;</a>If
<span class="add">there be</span> therefore any consolation in Christ, if any comfort of love, if any fellowship of the Spirit, if any
bowels and mercies,
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C2V2">&nbsp;</a>Fulfil ye my joy, that ye be likeminded, having the same love,
<span class="add">being</span> of one accord, of one mind.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C2V3">&nbsp;</a><span class="add">Let</span> nothing
<span class="add">be done</span> through strife or vainglory; but in lowliness of mind let each esteem other better than themselves.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C2V4">&nbsp;</a>Look not every man on his own things, but every man also on the things of others.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C2V5">&nbsp;</a>Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus:
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C2V6">&nbsp;</a>Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God:
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C2V7">&nbsp;</a>But made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness
of men:
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C2V8">&nbsp;</a>And being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death
of the cross.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C2V9">&nbsp;</a>Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name:
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C2V10">&nbsp;</a>That at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of
<span class="add">things</span> in heaven, and
<span class="add">things</span> in earth, and
<span class="add">things</span> under the earth;
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C2V11">&nbsp;</a>And
<span class="add">that</span> every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ
<span class="add">is</span> Lord, to the glory of God the Father.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C2V12">&nbsp;</a>Wherefore, my beloved, as ye have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my
absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C2V13">&nbsp;</a>For it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of
<span class="add">his</span> good pleasure.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C2V14">&nbsp;</a>Do all things without murmurings and disputings:
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C2V15">&nbsp;</a>That ye may be blameless and harmless, the sons of God, without rebuke, in the midst of a crooked and
perverse nation, among whom ye shine as lights in the world;
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C2V16">&nbsp;</a>Holding forth the word of life; that I may rejoice in the day of Christ, that I have not run in vain,
neither laboured in vain.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C2V17">&nbsp;</a>Yea, and if I be offered upon the sacrifice and service of your faith, I joy, and rejoice with you all.
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C2V18">&nbsp;</a>For the same cause also do ye joy, and rejoice with me.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C2V19">&nbsp;</a>But I trust in the Lord Jesus to send Timotheus shortly unto you, that I also may be of good comfort,
when I know your state.
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C2V20">&nbsp;</a>For I have no man likeminded, who will naturally care for your state.
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C2V21">&nbsp;</a>For all seek their own, not the things which are Jesus Christ’s.
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C2V22">&nbsp;</a>But ye know the proof of him, that, as a son with the father, he hath served with me in the gospel.
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C2V23">&nbsp;</a>Him therefore I hope to send presently, so soon as I shall see how it will go with me.
 <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C2V24">&nbsp;</a>But I trust in the Lord that I also myself shall come shortly.
 <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C2V25">&nbsp;</a>Yet I supposed it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother, and companion in labour, and fellow
soldier, but your messenger, and he that ministered to my wants.
 <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C2V26">&nbsp;</a>For he longed after you all, and was full of heaviness, because that ye had heard that he had been sick.
 <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C2V27">&nbsp;</a>For indeed he was sick nigh unto death: but God had mercy on him; and not on him only, but on me also,
lest I should have sorrow upon sorrow.
 <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C2V28">&nbsp;</a>I sent him therefore the more carefully, that, when ye see him again, ye may rejoice, and that I may
be the less sorrowful.
 <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C2V29">&nbsp;</a>Receive him therefore in the Lord with all gladness; and hold such in reputation:
 <span class="verse"> 30</span><a name="C2V30">&nbsp;</a>Because for the work of Christ he was nigh unto death, not regarding his life, to supply your lack of
service toward me.
