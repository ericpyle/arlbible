 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C12V1">&nbsp;</a>And it came to pass, when Rehoboam had established the kingdom, and had strengthened himself, he forsook
the law of the LORD, and all Israel with him.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C12V2">&nbsp;</a>And it came to pass,
<span class="add">that</span> in the fifth year of king Rehoboam Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem, because they had
transgressed against the LORD,
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C12V3">&nbsp;</a>With twelve hundred chariots, and threescore thousand horsemen: and the people
<span class="add">were</span> without number that came with him out of Egypt; the Lubim, the Sukkiims, and the Ethiopians.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C12V4">&nbsp;</a>And he took the fenced cities which
<span class="add">pertained</span> to Judah, and came to Jerusalem.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C12V5">&nbsp;</a>Then came Shemaiah the prophet to Rehoboam, and
<span class="add">to</span> the princes of Judah, that were gathered together to Jerusalem because of Shishak, and said unto them,
Thus saith the LORD, Ye have forsaken me, and therefore have I also left you in the hand of Shishak.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C12V6">&nbsp;</a>Whereupon the princes of Israel and the king humbled themselves; and they said, The LORD
<span class="add">is</span> righteous.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C12V7">&nbsp;</a>And when the LORD saw that they humbled themselves, the word of the LORD came to Shemaiah, saying, They
have humbled themselves;
<span class="add">therefore</span> I will not destroy them, but I will grant them some deliverance; and my wrath shall not be poured out
upon Jerusalem by the hand of Shishak.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C12V8">&nbsp;</a>Nevertheless they shall be his servants; that they may know my service, and the service of the kingdoms
of the countries.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C12V9">&nbsp;</a>So Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem, and took away the treasures of the house of the LORD,
and the treasures of the king’s house; he took all: he carried away also the shields of gold which Solomon
had made.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C12V10">&nbsp;</a>Instead of which king Rehoboam made shields of brass, and committed
<span class="add">them</span> to the hands of the chief of the guard, that kept the entrance of the king’s house.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C12V11">&nbsp;</a>And when the king entered into the house of the LORD, the guard came and fetched them, and brought them
again into the guard chamber.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C12V12">&nbsp;</a>And when he humbled himself, the wrath of the LORD turned from him that he would not destroy
<span class="add">him</span> altogether: and also in Judah things went well.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C12V13">&nbsp;</a>So king Rehoboam strengthened himself in Jerusalem, and reigned: for Rehoboam
<span class="add">was</span> one and forty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city
which the LORD had chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, to put his name there. And his mother’s name
<span class="add">was</span> Naamah an Ammonitess.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C12V14">&nbsp;</a>And he did evil, because he prepared not his heart to seek the LORD.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C12V15">&nbsp;</a>Now the acts of Rehoboam, first and last,
<span class="add">are</span> they not written in the book of Shemaiah the prophet, and of Iddo the seer concerning genealogies? And
<span class="add">there were</span> wars between Rehoboam and Jeroboam continually.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C12V16">&nbsp;</a>And Rehoboam slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David: and Abijah his son reigned
in his stead.
