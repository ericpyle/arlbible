 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C19V1">&nbsp;</a>And Saul spake to Jonathan his son, and to all his servants, that they should kill David.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C19V2">&nbsp;</a>But Jonathan Saul’s son delighted much in David: and Jonathan told David, saying, Saul my father seeketh
to kill thee: now therefore, I pray thee, take heed to thyself until the morning, and abide in a secret
<span class="add">place,</span> and hide thyself:
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C19V3">&nbsp;</a>And I will go out and stand beside my father in the field where thou
<span class="add">art,</span> and I will commune with my father of thee; and what I see, that I will tell thee.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C19V4">&nbsp;</a>And Jonathan spake good of David unto Saul his father, and said unto him, Let not the king sin against
his servant, against David; because he hath not sinned against thee, and because his works
<span class="add">have been</span> to thee-ward very good:
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C19V5">&nbsp;</a>For he did put his life in his hand, and slew the Philistine, and the LORD wrought a great salvation
for all Israel: thou sawest
<span class="add">it,</span> and didst rejoice: wherefore then wilt thou sin against innocent blood, to slay David without a cause?
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C19V6">&nbsp;</a>And Saul hearkened unto the voice of Jonathan: and Saul sware,
<span class="add">As</span> the LORD liveth, he shall not be slain.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C19V7">&nbsp;</a>And Jonathan called David, and Jonathan shewed him all those things. And Jonathan brought David to Saul,
and he was in his presence, as in times past.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C19V8">&nbsp;</a>And there was war again: and David went out, and fought with the Philistines, and slew them with a great
slaughter; and they fled from him.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C19V9">&nbsp;</a>And the evil spirit from the LORD was upon Saul, as he sat in his house with his javelin in his hand:
and David played with
<span class="add">his</span> hand.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C19V10">&nbsp;</a>And Saul sought to smite David even to the wall with the javelin; but he slipped away out of Saul’s presence,
and he smote the javelin into the wall: and David fled, and escaped that night.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C19V11">&nbsp;</a>Saul also sent messengers unto David’s house, to watch him, and to slay him in the morning: and Michal
David’s wife told him, saying, If thou save not thy life to night, to morrow thou shalt be slain.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C19V12">&nbsp;</a>So Michal let David down through a window: and he went, and fled, and escaped.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C19V13">&nbsp;</a>And Michal took an image, and laid
<span class="add">it</span> in the bed, and put a pillow of goats
<span class="add">hair</span> for his bolster, and covered
<span class="add">it</span> with a cloth.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C19V14">&nbsp;</a>And when Saul sent messengers to take David, she said, He
<span class="add">is</span> sick.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C19V15">&nbsp;</a>And Saul sent the messengers
<span class="add">again</span> to see David, saying, Bring him up to me in the bed, that I may slay him.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C19V16">&nbsp;</a>And when the messengers were come in, behold,
<span class="add">there was</span> an image in the bed, with a pillow of goats’
<span class="add">hair</span> for his bolster.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C19V17">&nbsp;</a>And Saul said unto Michal, Why hast thou deceived me so, and sent away mine enemy, that he is escaped?
And Michal answered Saul, He said unto me, Let me go; why should I kill thee?
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C19V18">&nbsp;</a>So David fled, and escaped, and came to Samuel to Ramah, and told him all that Saul had done to him.
And he and Samuel went and dwelt in Naioth.
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C19V19">&nbsp;</a>And it was told Saul, saying, Behold, David
<span class="add">is</span> at Naioth in Ramah.
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C19V20">&nbsp;</a>And Saul sent messengers to take David: and when they saw the company of the prophets prophesying, and
Samuel standing
<span class="add">as</span> appointed over them, the Spirit of God was upon the messengers of Saul, and they also prophesied.
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C19V21">&nbsp;</a>And when it was told Saul, he sent other messengers, and they prophesied likewise. And Saul sent messengers
again the third time, and they prophesied also.
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C19V22">&nbsp;</a>Then went he also to Ramah, and came to a great well that
<span class="add">is</span> in Sechu: and he asked and said, Where
<span class="add">are</span> Samuel and David? And
<span class="add">one</span> said, Behold,
<span class="add">they be</span> at Naioth in Ramah.
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C19V23">&nbsp;</a>And he went thither to Naioth in Ramah: and the Spirit of God was upon him also, and he went on, and
prophesied, until he came to Naioth in Ramah.
 <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C19V24">&nbsp;</a>And he stript off his clothes also, and prophesied before Samuel in like manner, and lay down naked all
that day and all that night. Wherefore they say,
<span class="add">Is</span> Saul also among the prophets?
