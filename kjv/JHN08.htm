<div class="chapterlabel"> 8</div><div class="p">
 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C8V1">&nbsp;</a>Jesus went unto the mount of Olives.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C8V2">&nbsp;</a>And early in the morning he came again into the temple, and all the people came unto him; and he sat
down, and taught them.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C8V3">&nbsp;</a>And the scribes and Pharisees brought unto him a woman taken in adultery; and when they had set her in
the midst,
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C8V4">&nbsp;</a>They say unto him, Master, this woman was taken in adultery, in the very act.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C8V5">&nbsp;</a>Now Moses in the law commanded us, that such should be stoned: but what sayest thou?
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C8V6">&nbsp;</a>This they said, tempting him, that they might have to accuse him. But Jesus stooped down, and with
<span class="add">his</span> finger wrote on the ground,
<span class="add">as though he heard them not.
</span> <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C8V7">&nbsp;</a>So when they continued asking him, he lifted up himself, and said unto them,
<span class="wj">He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her.
</span> <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C8V8">&nbsp;</a>And again he stooped down, and wrote on the ground.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C8V9">&nbsp;</a>And they which heard
<span class="add">it,</span> being convicted by
<span class="add">their own</span> conscience, went out one by one, beginning at the eldest,
<span class="add">even</span> unto the last: and Jesus was left alone, and the woman standing in the midst.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C8V10">&nbsp;</a>When Jesus had lifted up himself, and saw none but the woman, he said unto her,
<span class="wj">Woman, where are those thine accusers? hath no man condemned thee?
</span> <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C8V11">&nbsp;</a>She said, No man, Lord. And Jesus said unto her,
<span class="wj">Neither do I condemn thee: go, and sin no more.</span></div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C8V12">&nbsp;</a>Then spake Jesus again unto them, saying,
<span class="wj">I am the light of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light
of life.
</span> <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C8V13">&nbsp;</a>The Pharisees therefore said unto him, Thou bearest record of thyself; thy record is not true.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C8V14">&nbsp;</a>Jesus answered and said unto them,
<span class="wj">Though I bear record of myself,
yet my record is true: for I know whence I came, and whither I go; but ye cannot tell whence I come, and
whither I go.
</span> <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C8V15">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Ye judge after the flesh; I judge no man.
</span> <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C8V16">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And yet if I judge, my judgment is true: for I am not alone, but I and the Father that sent me.
</span> <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C8V17">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">It is also written in your law, that the testimony of two men is true.
</span> <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C8V18">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">I am one that bear witness of myself, and the Father that sent me beareth witness of me.
</span> <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C8V19">&nbsp;</a>Then said they unto him, Where is thy Father? Jesus answered,
<span class="wj">Ye neither know me, nor my Father: if ye had known me, ye should have known my Father also.
</span> <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C8V20">&nbsp;</a>These words spake Jesus in the treasury, as he taught in the temple: and no man laid hands on him; for
his hour was not yet come.
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C8V21">&nbsp;</a>Then said Jesus again unto them,
<span class="wj">I go my way, and ye shall seek me, and shall die in your sins: whither I go, ye cannot come.
</span> <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C8V22">&nbsp;</a>Then said the Jews, Will he kill himself? because he saith,
<span class="wj">Whither I go, ye cannot come.
</span> <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C8V23">&nbsp;</a>And he said unto them,
<span class="wj">Ye are from beneath; I am from above: ye are of this world; I am not of this world.
</span> <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C8V24">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">I said therefore unto you, that ye shall die in your sins: for if ye believe not that I am
he, ye shall die in your sins.
</span> <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C8V25">&nbsp;</a>Then said they unto him, Who art thou? And Jesus saith unto them,
<span class="wj">Even
the same that I said unto you from the beginning.
</span> <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C8V26">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">I have many things to say and to judge of you: but he that sent me is true; and I speak to the world
those things which I have heard of him.
</span> <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C8V27">&nbsp;</a>They understood not that he spake to them of the Father.
 <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C8V28">&nbsp;</a>Then said Jesus unto them,
<span class="wj">When ye have lifted up the Son of man, then shall ye know that I am
he, and
that I do nothing of myself; but as my Father hath taught me, I speak these things.
</span> <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C8V29">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And he that sent me is with me: the Father hath not left me alone; for I do always those things that
please him.
</span> <span class="verse"> 30</span><a name="C8V30">&nbsp;</a>As he spake these words, many believed on him.
 <span class="verse"> 31</span><a name="C8V31">&nbsp;</a>Then said Jesus to those Jews which believed on him,
<span class="wj">If ye continue in my word,
then are ye my disciples indeed;
</span> <span class="verse"> 32</span><a name="C8V32">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.
</span></div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 33</span><a name="C8V33">&nbsp;</a>They answered him, We be Abraham’s seed, and were never in bondage to any man: how sayest thou,
<span class="wj">Ye shall be made free?
</span> <span class="verse"> 34</span><a name="C8V34">&nbsp;</a>Jesus answered them,
<span class="wj">Verily, verily, I say unto you, Whosoever committeth sin is the servant of sin.
</span> <span class="verse"> 35</span><a name="C8V35">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And the servant abideth not in the house for ever:
but the Son abideth ever.
</span> <span class="verse"> 36</span><a name="C8V36">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">If the Son therefore shall make you free, ye shall be free indeed.
</span> <span class="verse"> 37</span><a name="C8V37">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">I know that ye are Abraham’s seed; but ye seek to kill me, because my word hath no place in you.
</span> <span class="verse"> 38</span><a name="C8V38">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">I speak that which I have seen with my Father: and ye do that which ye have seen with your father.
</span> <span class="verse"> 39</span><a name="C8V39">&nbsp;</a>They answered and said unto him, Abraham is our father. Jesus saith unto them,
<span class="wj">If ye were Abraham’s children, ye would do the works of Abraham.
</span> <span class="verse"> 40</span><a name="C8V40">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">But now ye seek to kill me, a man that hath told you the truth, which I have heard of God: this did not
Abraham.
</span> <span class="verse"> 41</span><a name="C8V41">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Ye do the deeds of your father.</span> Then said they to him, We be not born of fornication; we have one Father,
<span class="add">even</span> God.
 <span class="verse"> 42</span><a name="C8V42">&nbsp;</a>Jesus said unto them,
<span class="wj">If God were your Father, ye would love me: for I proceeded forth and came from God; neither came I of
myself, but he sent me.
</span> <span class="verse"> 43</span><a name="C8V43">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Why do ye not understand my speech?
even because ye cannot hear my word.
</span> <span class="verse"> 44</span><a name="C8V44">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Ye are of your father the devil, and the lusts of
your father ye will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is
no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a liar, and the father of
it.
</span> <span class="verse"> 45</span><a name="C8V45">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And because I tell
you the truth, ye believe me not.
</span> <span class="verse"> 46</span><a name="C8V46">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Which of you convinceth me of sin? And if I say the truth, why do ye not believe me?
</span> <span class="verse"> 47</span><a name="C8V47">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">He that is of God heareth God’s words: ye therefore hear
them not, because ye are not of God.
</span> <span class="verse"> 48</span><a name="C8V48">&nbsp;</a>Then answered the Jews, and said unto him, Say we not well that thou art a Samaritan, and hast a devil?
 <span class="verse"> 49</span><a name="C8V49">&nbsp;</a>Jesus answered,
<span class="wj">I have not a devil; but I honour my Father, and ye do dishonour me.
</span> <span class="verse"> 50</span><a name="C8V50">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And I seek not mine own glory: there is one that seeketh and judgeth.
</span> <span class="verse"> 51</span><a name="C8V51">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Verily, verily, I say unto you, If a man keep my saying, he shall never see death.
</span> <span class="verse"> 52</span><a name="C8V52">&nbsp;</a>Then said the Jews unto him, Now we know that thou hast a devil. Abraham is dead, and the prophets; and
thou sayest,
<span class="wj">If a man keep my saying, he shall never taste of death.
</span> <span class="verse"> 53</span><a name="C8V53">&nbsp;</a>Art thou greater than our father Abraham, which is dead? and the prophets are dead: whom makest thou
thyself?
 <span class="verse"> 54</span><a name="C8V54">&nbsp;</a>Jesus answered,
<span class="wj">If I honour myself, my honour is nothing: it is my Father that honoureth me; of whom ye say, that he
is your God:
</span> <span class="verse"> 55</span><a name="C8V55">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Yet ye have not known him; but I know him: and if I should say, I know him not, I shall be a liar like
unto you: but I know him, and keep his saying.
</span> <span class="verse"> 56</span><a name="C8V56">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day: and he saw
it, and was glad.
</span> <span class="verse"> 57</span><a name="C8V57">&nbsp;</a>Then said the Jews unto him, Thou art not yet fifty years old, and hast thou seen Abraham?
 <span class="verse"> 58</span><a name="C8V58">&nbsp;</a>Jesus said unto them,
<span class="wj">Verily, verily, I say unto you, Before Abraham was, I am.
</span> <span class="verse"> 59</span><a name="C8V59">&nbsp;</a>Then took they up stones to cast at him: but Jesus hid himself, and went out of the temple, going through
the midst of them, and so passed by.
