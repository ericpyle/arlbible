 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C8V1">&nbsp;</a>Moreover, brethren, we do you to wit of the grace of God bestowed on the churches of Macedonia;
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C8V2">&nbsp;</a>How that in a great trial of affliction the abundance of their joy and their deep poverty abounded unto
the riches of their liberality.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C8V3">&nbsp;</a>For to
<span class="add">their</span> power, I bear record, yea, and beyond
<span class="add">their
</span> power
<span class="add">they were</span> willing of themselves;
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C8V4">&nbsp;</a>Praying us with much intreaty that we would receive the gift, and
<span class="add">take upon us</span> the fellowship of the ministering to the saints.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C8V5">&nbsp;</a>And
<span class="add">this they did,</span> not as we hoped, but first gave their own selves to the Lord, and unto us by the will of God.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C8V6">&nbsp;</a>Insomuch that we desired Titus, that as he had begun, so he would also finish in you the same grace also.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C8V7">&nbsp;</a>Therefore, as ye abound in every
<span class="add">thing, in</span> faith, and utterance, and knowledge, and
<span class="add">in</span> all diligence, and
<span class="add">in
</span> your love to us,
<span class="add">see</span> that ye abound in this grace also.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C8V8">&nbsp;</a>I speak not by commandment, but by occasion of the forwardness of others, and to prove the sincerity
of your love.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C8V9">&nbsp;</a>For ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that, though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became
poor, that ye through his poverty might be rich.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C8V10">&nbsp;</a>And herein I give
<span class="add">my</span> advice: for this is expedient for you, who have begun before, not only to do, but also to be forward
a year ago.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C8V11">&nbsp;</a>Now therefore perform the doing
<span class="add">of it;</span> that as
<span class="add">there was
</span> a readiness to will, so
<span class="add">there may be</span> a performance also out of that which ye have.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C8V12">&nbsp;</a>For if there be first a willing mind,
<span class="add">it is</span> accepted according to that a man hath,
<span class="add">and</span> not according to that he hath not.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C8V13">&nbsp;</a>For
<span class="add">I mean</span> not that other men be eased, and ye burdened:
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C8V14">&nbsp;</a>But by an equality,
<span class="add">that</span> now at this time your abundance
<span class="add">may be a supply</span> for their want, that their abundance also may be
<span class="add">a supply</span> for your want: that there may be equality:
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C8V15">&nbsp;</a>As it is written, He that
<span class="add">had gathered</span> much had nothing over; and he that
<span class="add">had gathered</span> little had no lack.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C8V16">&nbsp;</a>But thanks
<span class="add">be</span> to God, which put the same earnest care into the heart of Titus for you.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C8V17">&nbsp;</a>For indeed he accepted the exhortation; but being more forward, of his own accord he went unto you.
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C8V18">&nbsp;</a>And we have sent with him the brother, whose praise is in the gospel throughout all the churches;
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C8V19">&nbsp;</a>And not
<span class="add">that</span> only, but who was also chosen of the churches to travel with us with this grace, which is administered
by us to the glory of the same Lord, and
<span class="add">declaration of</span> your ready mind:
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C8V20">&nbsp;</a>Avoiding this, that no man should blame us in this abundance which is administered by us:
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C8V21">&nbsp;</a>Providing for honest things, not only in the sight of the Lord, but also in the sight of men.
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C8V22">&nbsp;</a>And we have sent with them our brother, whom we have oftentimes proved diligent in many things, but now
much more diligent, upon the great confidence which
<span class="add">I have</span> in you.
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C8V23">&nbsp;</a>Whether
<span class="add">any do enquire</span> of Titus,
<span class="add">he is</span> my partner and fellowhelper concerning you: or our brethren
<span class="add">be enquired of, they are</span> the messengers of the churches,
<span class="add">and</span> the glory of Christ.
 <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C8V24">&nbsp;</a>Wherefore shew ye to them, and before the churches, the proof of your love, and of our boasting on your
behalf.
