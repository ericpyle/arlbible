 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C6V1">&nbsp;</a>Now it came to pass, when Sanballat, and Tobiah, and Geshem the Arabian, and the rest of our enemies,
heard that I had builded the wall, and
<span class="add">that</span> there was no breach left therein; (though at that time I had not set up the doors upon the gates;)
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C6V2">&nbsp;</a>That Sanballat and Geshem sent unto me, saying, Come, let us meet together in
<span class="add">some one of</span> the villages in the plain of Ono. But they thought to do me mischief.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C6V3">&nbsp;</a>And I sent messengers unto them, saying, I
<span class="add">am</span> doing a great work, so that I cannot come down: why should the work cease, whilst I leave it, and come
down to you?
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C6V4">&nbsp;</a>Yet they sent unto me four times after this sort; and I answered them after the same manner.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C6V5">&nbsp;</a>Then sent Sanballat his servant unto me in like manner the fifth time with an open letter in his hand;
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C6V6">&nbsp;</a>Wherein
<span class="add">was</span> written, It is reported among the heathen, and Gashmu saith
<span class="add">it, that</span> thou and the Jews think to rebel: for which cause thou buildest the wall, that thou mayest be their
king, according to these words.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C6V7">&nbsp;</a>And thou hast also appointed prophets to preach of thee at Jerusalem, saying,
<span class="add">There is</span> a king in Judah: and now shall it be reported to the king according to these words. Come now therefore,
and let us take counsel together.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C6V8">&nbsp;</a>Then I sent unto him, saying, There are no such things done as thou sayest, but thou feignest them out
of thine own heart.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C6V9">&nbsp;</a>For they all made us afraid, saying, Their hands shall be weakened from the work, that it be not done.
Now therefore,
<span class="add">O God,</span> strengthen my hands.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C6V10">&nbsp;</a>Afterward I came unto the house of Shemaiah the son of Delaiah the son of Mehetabeel, who
<span class="add">was</span> shut up; and he said, Let us meet together in the house of God, within the temple, and let us shut the
doors of the temple: for they will come to slay thee; yea, in the night will they come to slay thee.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C6V11">&nbsp;</a>And I said, Should such a man as I flee? and who
<span class="add">is there,
</span> that,
<span class="add">being</span> as I
<span class="add">am,</span> would go into the temple to save his life? I will not go in.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C6V12">&nbsp;</a>And, lo, I perceived that God had not sent him; but that he pronounced this prophecy against me: for
Tobiah and Sanballat had hired him.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C6V13">&nbsp;</a>Therefore
<span class="add">was</span> he hired, that I should be afraid, and do so, and sin, and
<span class="add">that</span> they might have
<span class="add">matter</span> for an evil report, that they might reproach me.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C6V14">&nbsp;</a>My God, think thou upon Tobiah and Sanballat according to these their works, and on the prophetess Noadiah,
and the rest of the prophets, that would have put me in fear.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C6V15">&nbsp;</a>So the wall was finished in the twenty and fifth
<span class="add">day</span> of
<span class="add">the month</span> Elul, in fifty and two days.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C6V16">&nbsp;</a>And it came to pass, that when all our enemies heard
<span class="add">thereof,
</span> and all the heathen that
<span class="add">were</span> about us saw
<span class="add">these things,
</span> they were much cast down in their own eyes: for they perceived that this work was wrought of our God.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C6V17">&nbsp;</a>Moreover in those days the nobles of Judah sent many letters unto Tobiah, and
<span class="add">the letters</span> of Tobiah came unto them.
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C6V18">&nbsp;</a>For
<span class="add">there were</span> many in Judah sworn unto him, because he
<span class="add">was</span> the son in law of Shechaniah the son of Arah; and his son Johanan had taken the daughter of Meshullam
the son of Berechiah.
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C6V19">&nbsp;</a>Also they reported his good deeds before me, and uttered my words to him.
<span class="add">And</span> Tobiah sent letters to put me in fear.
