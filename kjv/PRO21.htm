 <span class="verse" id="V1">1&nbsp;</span>The king’s heart <span class='add'>is</span> in the hand of the LORD, <span class='add'>as</span> the rivers of water: he turneth it whithersoever he will.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span>Every way of a man <span class='add'>is</span> right in his own eyes: but the LORD pondereth the hearts.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>To do justice and judgment <span class='add'>is</span> more acceptable to the LORD than sacrifice.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>An high look, and a proud heart, <span class='add'>and</span> the plowing of the wicked, <span class='add'>is</span> sin.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>The thoughts of the diligent <span class='add'>tend</span> only to plenteousness; but of every one <span class='add'>that is</span> hasty only to want.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>The getting of treasures by a lying tongue <span class='add'>is</span> a vanity tossed to and fro of them that seek death.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>The robbery of the wicked shall destroy them; because they refuse to do judgment.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>The way of man <span class='add'>is</span> froward and strange: but <span class='add'>as for</span> the pure, his work <span class='add'>is</span> right.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span> <span class='add'>It is</span> better to dwell in a corner of the housetop, than with a brawling woman in a wide house.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>The soul of the wicked desireth evil: his neighbour findeth no favour in his eyes.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>When the scorner is punished, the simple is made wise: and when the wise is instructed, he receiveth knowledge.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>The righteous <span class='add'>man</span> wisely considereth the house of the wicked: <span class='add'>but God</span> overthroweth the wicked for <span class='add'>their</span> wickedness.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>Whoso stoppeth his ears at the cry of the poor, he also shall cry himself, but shall not be heard.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>A gift in secret pacifieth anger: and a reward in the bosom strong wrath.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span> <span class='add'>It is</span> joy to the just to do judgment: but destruction <span class='add'>shall be</span> to the workers of iniquity.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>The man that wandereth out of the way of understanding shall remain in the congregation of the dead.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>He that loveth pleasure <span class='add'>shall be</span> a poor man: he that loveth wine and oil shall not be rich.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>The wicked <span class='add'>shall be</span> a ransom for the righteous, and the transgressor for the upright.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span> <span class='add'>It is</span> better to dwell in the wilderness, than with a contentious and an angry woman.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span> <span class='add'>There is</span> treasure to be desired and oil in the dwelling of the wise; but a foolish man spendeth it up.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>He that followeth after righteousness and mercy findeth life, righteousness, and honour.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>A wise <span class='add'>man</span> scaleth the city of the mighty, and casteth down the strength of the confidence thereof.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>Whoso keepeth his mouth and his tongue keepeth his soul from troubles.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>Proud <span class='add'>and</span> haughty scorner <span class='add'>is</span> his name, who dealeth in proud wrath.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>The desire of the slothful killeth him; for his hands refuse to labour.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>He coveteth greedily all the day long: but the righteous giveth and spareth not.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>The sacrifice of the wicked <span class='add'>is</span> abomination: how much more, <span class='add'>when</span> he bringeth it with a wicked mind?  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&nbsp;</span>A false witness shall perish: but the man that heareth speaketh constantly.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&nbsp;</span>A wicked man hardeneth his face: but <span class='add'>as for</span> the upright, he directeth his way.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&nbsp;</span> <span class='add'>There is</span> no wisdom nor understanding nor counsel against the LORD.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&nbsp;</span>The horse <span class='add'>is</span> prepared against the day of battle: but safety <span class='add'>is</span> of the LORD. </div><ul class='tnav'>
