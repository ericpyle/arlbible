 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C15V1">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">I am the true vine, and my Father is the husbandman.
</span> <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C15V2">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Every branch in me that beareth not fruit he taketh away: and every
branch that beareth fruit, he purgeth it, that it may bring forth more fruit.
</span> <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C15V3">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Now ye are clean through the word which I have spoken unto you.
</span> <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C15V4">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Abide in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, except it abide in the vine; no
more can ye, except ye abide in me.
</span> <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C15V5">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">I am the vine, ye
are the branches: He that abideth in me, and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit: for without me
ye can do nothing.
</span> <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C15V6">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">If a man abide not in me, he is cast forth as a branch, and is withered; and men gather them, and cast
them into the fire, and they are burned.
</span> <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C15V7">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">If ye abide in me, and my words abide in you, ye shall ask what ye will, and it shall be done unto you.
</span> <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C15V8">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Herein is my Father glorified, that ye bear much fruit; so shall ye be my disciples.
</span> <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C15V9">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">As the Father hath loved me, so have I loved you: continue ye in my love.
</span> <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C15V10">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">If ye keep my commandments, ye shall abide in my love; even as I have kept my Father’s commandments,
and abide in his love.
</span> <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C15V11">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">These things have I spoken unto you, that my joy might remain in you, and
that your joy might be full.
</span> <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C15V12">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">This is my commandment, That ye love one another, as I have loved you.
</span> <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C15V13">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.
</span> <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C15V14">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Ye are my friends, if ye do whatsoever I command you.
</span> <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C15V15">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Henceforth I call you not servants; for the servant knoweth not what his lord doeth: but I have called
you friends; for all things that I have heard of my Father I have made known unto you.
</span> <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C15V16">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you, and ordained you, that ye should go and bring forth fruit,
and
that your fruit should remain: that whatsoever ye shall ask of the Father in my name, he may give it you.
</span> <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C15V17">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">These things I command you, that ye love one another.
</span> <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C15V18">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">If the world hate you, ye know that
it hated me before it hated you.
</span> <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C15V19">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">If ye were of the world, the world would love his own: but because ye are not of the world, but I have
chosen you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you.
</span> <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C15V20">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Remember the word that I said unto you, The servant is not greater than his lord. If they have persecuted
me, they will also persecute you; if they have kept my saying, they will keep yours also.
</span> <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C15V21">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">But all these things will they do unto you for my name’s sake, because they know not him that sent me.
</span> <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C15V22">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">If I had not come and spoken unto them, they had not had sin: but now they have no cloke for their sin.
</span> <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C15V23">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">He that hateth me hateth my Father also.
</span> <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C15V24">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">If I had not done among them the works which none other man did, they had not had sin: but now have they
both seen and hated both me and my Father.
</span> <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C15V25">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">But
this cometh to pass, that the word might be fulfilled that is written in their law, They hated me without a cause.
</span> <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C15V26">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">But when the Comforter is come, whom I will send unto you from the Father,
even the Spirit of truth, which proceedeth from the Father, he shall testify of me:
</span> <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C15V27">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And ye also shall bear witness, because ye have been with me from the beginning.</span></div>
