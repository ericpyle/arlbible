 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C5V1">&nbsp;</a>Then was it declared to Holofernes, the chief captain of the army of Assur, that the children of Israel
had prepared for war, and had shut up the passages of the hill country, and had fortified all the tops
of the high hills and had laid impediments in the champaign countries:
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C5V2">&nbsp;</a>Wherewith he was very angry, and called all the princes of Moab, and the captains of Ammon, and all the
governors of the sea coast,
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C5V3">&nbsp;</a>And he said unto them, Tell me now, ye sons of Chanaan, who this people is, that dwelleth in the hill
country, and what are the cities that they inhabit, and what is the multitude of their army, and wherein
is their power and strength, and what king is set over them, or captain of their army;
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C5V4">&nbsp;</a>And why have they determined not to come and meet me, more than all the inhabitants of the west.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C5V5">&nbsp;</a>Then said Achior, the captain of all the sons of Ammon, Let my lord now hear a word from the mouth of
thy servant, and I will declare unto thee the truth concerning this people, which dwelleth near thee,
and inhabiteth the hill countries: and there shall no lie come out of the mouth of thy servant.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C5V6">&nbsp;</a>This people are descended of the Chaldeans:
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C5V7">&nbsp;</a>And they sojourned heretofore in Mesopotamia, because they would not follow the gods of their fathers,
which were in the land of Chaldea.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C5V8">&nbsp;</a>For they left the way of their ancestors, and worshipped the God of heaven, the God whom they knew: so
they cast them out from the face of their gods, and they fled into Mesopotamia, and sojourned there many
days.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C5V9">&nbsp;</a>Then their God commanded them to depart from the place where they sojourned, and to go into the land
of Chanaan: where they dwelt, and were increased with gold and silver, and with very much cattle.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C5V10">&nbsp;</a>But when a famine covered all the land of Chanaan, they went down into Egypt, and sojourned there, while
they were nourished, and became there a great multitude, so that one could not number their nation.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C5V11">&nbsp;</a>Therefore the king of Egypt rose up against them, and dealt subtilly with them, and brought them low
with labouring in brick, and made them slaves.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C5V12">&nbsp;</a>Then they cried unto their God, and he smote all the land of Egypt with incurable plagues: so the Egyptians
cast them out of their sight.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C5V13">&nbsp;</a>And God dried the Red sea before them,
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C5V14">&nbsp;</a>And brought them to mount Sina, and Cades-Barne, and cast forth all that dwelt in the wilderness.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C5V15">&nbsp;</a>So they dwelt in the land of the Amorites, and they destroyed by their strength all them of Esebon, and
passing over Jordan they possessed all the hill country.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C5V16">&nbsp;</a>And they cast forth before them the Chanaanite, the Pherezite, the Jebusite, and the Sychemite, and all
the Gergesites, and they dwelt in that country many days.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C5V17">&nbsp;</a>And whilst they sinned not before their God, they prospered, because the God that hateth iniquity was
with them.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C5V18">&nbsp;</a>But when they departed from the way which he appointed them, they were destroyed in many battles very
sore, and were led captives into a land that was not their’s, and the temple of their God was cast to
the ground, and their cities were taken by the enemies.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C5V19">&nbsp;</a>But now are they returned to their God, and are come up from the places where they were scattered, and
have possessed Jerusalem, where their sanctuary is, and are seated in the hill country; for it was desolate.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C5V20">&nbsp;</a>Now therefore, my lord and governor, if there be any error against this people, and they sin against
their God, let us consider that this shall be their ruin, and let us go up, and we shall overcome them.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C5V21">&nbsp;</a>But if there be no iniquity in their nation, let my lord now pass by, lest their Lord defend them, and
their God be for them, and we become a reproach before all the world.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C5V22">&nbsp;</a>And when Achior had finished these sayings, all the people standing round about the tent murmured, and
the chief men of Holofernes, and all that dwelt by the sea side, and in Moab, spake that he should kill
him.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C5V23">&nbsp;</a>For, say they, we will not be afraid of the face of the children of Israel: for, lo, it is a people that
have no strength nor power for a strong battle
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C5V24">&nbsp;</a>Now therefore, lord Holofernes, we will go up, and they shall be a prey to be devoured of all thine army.
