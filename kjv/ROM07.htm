 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C7V1">&nbsp;</a>Know ye not, brethren, (for I speak to them that know the law,) how that the law hath dominion over a
man as long as he liveth?
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C7V2">&nbsp;</a>For the woman which hath an husband is bound by the law to
<span class="add">her
</span> husband so long as he liveth; but if the husband be dead, she is loosed from the law of
<span class="add">her</span> husband.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C7V3">&nbsp;</a>So then if, while
<span class="add">her</span> husband liveth, she be married to another man, she shall be called an adulteress: but if her husband
be dead, she is free from that law; so that she is no adulteress, though she be married to another man.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C7V4">&nbsp;</a>Wherefore, my brethren, ye also are become dead to the law by the body of Christ; that ye should be married
to another,
<span class="add">even</span> to him who is raised from the dead, that we should bring forth fruit unto God.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C7V5">&nbsp;</a>For when we were in the flesh, the motions of sins, which were by the law, did work in our members to
bring forth fruit unto death.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C7V6">&nbsp;</a>But now we are delivered from the law, that being dead wherein we were held; that we should serve in
newness of spirit, and not
<span class="add">in</span> the oldness of the letter.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C7V7">&nbsp;</a>What shall we say then?
<span class="add">Is</span> the law sin? God forbid. Nay, I had not known sin, but by the law: for I had not known lust, except
the law had said, Thou shalt not covet.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C7V8">&nbsp;</a>But sin, taking occasion by the commandment, wrought in me all manner of concupiscence. For without the
law sin
<span class="add">was</span> dead.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C7V9">&nbsp;</a>For I was alive without the law once: but when the commandment came, sin revived, and I died.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C7V10">&nbsp;</a>And the commandment, which
<span class="add">was ordained</span> to life, I found
<span class="add">to be</span> unto death.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C7V11">&nbsp;</a>For sin, taking occasion by the commandment, deceived me, and by it slew
<span class="add">me.
</span> <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C7V12">&nbsp;</a>Wherefore the law
<span class="add">is</span> holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C7V13">&nbsp;</a>Was then that which is good made death unto me? God forbid. But sin, that it might appear sin, working
death in me by that which is good; that sin by the commandment might become exceeding sinful.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C7V14">&nbsp;</a>For we know that the law is spiritual: but I am carnal, sold under sin.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C7V15">&nbsp;</a>For that which I do I allow not: for what I would, that do I not; but what I hate, that do I.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C7V16">&nbsp;</a>If then I do that which I would not, I consent unto the law that
<span class="add">it is</span> good.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C7V17">&nbsp;</a>Now then it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me.
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C7V18">&nbsp;</a>For I know that in me (that is, in my flesh,) dwelleth no good thing: for to will is present with me;
but
<span class="add">how</span> to perform that which is good I find not.
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C7V19">&nbsp;</a>For the good that I would I do not: but the evil which I would not, that I do.
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C7V20">&nbsp;</a>Now if I do that I would not, it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me.
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C7V21">&nbsp;</a>I find then a law, that, when I would do good, evil is present with me.
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C7V22">&nbsp;</a>For I delight in the law of God after the inward man:
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C7V23">&nbsp;</a>But I see another law in my members, warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity
to the law of sin which is in my members.
 <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C7V24">&nbsp;</a>O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of this death?
 <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C7V25">&nbsp;</a>I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord. So then with the mind I myself serve the law of God; but with
the flesh the law of sin.
