 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C26V1">&nbsp;</a>Then Agrippa said unto Paul, Thou art permitted to speak for thyself. Then Paul stretched forth the hand,
and answered for himself:
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C26V2">&nbsp;</a>I think myself happy, king Agrippa, because I shall answer for myself this day before thee touching all
the things whereof I am accused of the Jews:
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C26V3">&nbsp;</a>Especially
<span class="add">because I know</span> thee to be expert in all customs and questions which are among the Jews: wherefore I beseech thee to
hear me patiently.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C26V4">&nbsp;</a>My manner of life from my youth, which was at the first among mine own nation at Jerusalem, know all
the Jews;
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C26V5">&nbsp;</a>Which knew me from the beginning, if they would testify, that after the most straitest sect of our religion
I lived a Pharisee.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C26V6">&nbsp;</a>And now I stand and am judged for the hope of the promise made of God unto our fathers:
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C26V7">&nbsp;</a>Unto which
<span class="add">promise</span> our twelve tribes, instantly serving
<span class="add">God</span> day and night, hope to come. For which hope’s sake, king Agrippa, I am accused of the Jews.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C26V8">&nbsp;</a>Why should it be thought a thing incredible with you, that God should raise the dead?
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C26V9">&nbsp;</a>I verily thought with myself, that I ought to do many things contrary to the name of Jesus of Nazareth.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C26V10">&nbsp;</a>Which thing I also did in Jerusalem: and many of the saints did I shut up in prison, having received
authority from the chief priests; and when they were put to death, I gave my voice against
<span class="add">them.
</span> <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C26V11">&nbsp;</a>And I punished them oft in every synagogue, and compelled
<span class="add">them
</span> to blaspheme; and being exceedingly mad against them, I persecuted
<span class="add">them</span> even unto strange cities.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C26V12">&nbsp;</a>Whereupon as I went to Damascus with authority and commission from the chief priests,
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C26V13">&nbsp;</a>At midday, O king, I saw in the way a light from heaven, above the brightness of the sun, shining round
about me and them which journeyed with me.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C26V14">&nbsp;</a>And when we were all fallen to the earth, I heard a voice speaking unto me, and saying in the Hebrew
tongue,
<span class="wj">Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?
</span><span class="add">it is</span><span class="wj">hard for thee to kick against the pricks.
</span> <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C26V15">&nbsp;</a>And I said, Who art thou, Lord? And he said,
<span class="wj">I am Jesus whom thou persecutest.
</span> <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C26V16">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">But rise, and stand upon thy feet: for I have appeared unto thee for this purpose, to make thee a minister
and a witness both of these things which thou hast seen, and of those things in the which I will appear
unto thee;
</span> <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C26V17">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Delivering thee from the people, and
</span><span class="add">from</span><span class="wj">the Gentiles, unto whom now I send thee,
</span> <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C26V18">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">To open their eyes,
</span><span class="add">and</span><span class="wj">to turn
</span><span class="add">them
</span><span class="wj">from darkness to light, and
</span><span class="add">from</span><span class="wj">the power of Satan unto God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins, and inheritance among them which
are sanctified by faith that is in me.
</span> <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C26V19">&nbsp;</a>Whereupon, O king Agrippa, I was not disobedient unto the heavenly vision:
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C26V20">&nbsp;</a>But shewed first unto them of Damascus, and at Jerusalem, and throughout all the coasts of Judaea, and
<span class="add">then</span> to the Gentiles, that they should repent and turn to God, and do works meet for repentance.
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C26V21">&nbsp;</a>For these causes the Jews caught me in the temple, and went about to kill
<span class="add">me.
</span> <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C26V22">&nbsp;</a>Having therefore obtained help of God, I continue unto this day, witnessing both to small and great,
saying none other things than those which the prophets and Moses did say should come:
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C26V23">&nbsp;</a>That Christ should suffer,
<span class="add">and</span> that he should be the first that should rise from the dead, and should shew light unto the people, and
to the Gentiles.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C26V24">&nbsp;</a>And as he thus spake for himself, Festus said with a loud voice, Paul, thou art beside thyself; much
learning doth make thee mad.
 <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C26V25">&nbsp;</a>But he said, I am not mad, most noble Festus; but speak forth the words of truth and soberness.
 <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C26V26">&nbsp;</a>For the king knoweth of these things, before whom also I speak freely: for I am persuaded that none of
these things are hidden from him; for this thing was not done in a corner.
 <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C26V27">&nbsp;</a>King Agrippa, believest thou the prophets? I know that thou believest.
 <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C26V28">&nbsp;</a>Then Agrippa said unto Paul, Almost thou persuadest me to be a Christian.
 <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C26V29">&nbsp;</a>And Paul said, I would to God, that not only thou, but also all that hear me this day, were both almost,
and altogether such as I am, except these bonds.
 <span class="verse"> 30</span><a name="C26V30">&nbsp;</a>And when he had thus spoken, the king rose up, and the governor, and Bernice, and they that sat with
them:
 <span class="verse"> 31</span><a name="C26V31">&nbsp;</a>And when they were gone aside, they talked between themselves, saying, This man doeth nothing worthy
of death or of bonds.
 <span class="verse"> 32</span><a name="C26V32">&nbsp;</a>Then said Agrippa unto Festus, This man might have been set at liberty, if he had not appealed unto Caesar.
