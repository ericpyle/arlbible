 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C40V1">&nbsp;</a>In the five and twentieth year of our captivity, in the beginning of the year, in the tenth
<span class="add">day</span> of the month, in the fourteenth year after that the city was smitten, in the selfsame day the hand of
the LORD was upon me, and brought me thither.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C40V2">&nbsp;</a>In the visions of God brought he me into the land of Israel, and set me upon a very high mountain, by
which
<span class="add">was</span> as the frame of a city on the south.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C40V3">&nbsp;</a>And he brought me thither, and, behold,
<span class="add">there was</span> a man, whose appearance was like the appearance of brass, with a line of flax in his hand, and a measuring
reed; and he stood in the gate.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C40V4">&nbsp;</a>And the man said unto me, Son of man, behold with thine eyes, and hear with thine ears, and set thine
heart upon all that I shall shew thee; for to the intent that I might shew
<span class="add">them</span> unto thee
<span class="add">art</span> thou brought hither: declare all that thou seest to the house of Israel.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C40V5">&nbsp;</a>And behold a wall on the outside of the house round about, and in the man’s hand a measuring reed of
six cubits
<span class="add">long</span> by the cubit and an hand breadth: so he measured the breadth of the building, one reed; and the height,
one reed.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C40V6">&nbsp;</a>Then came he unto the gate which looketh toward the east, and went up the stairs thereof, and measured
the threshold of the gate,
<span class="add">which was</span> one reed broad; and the other threshold
<span class="add">of the gate, which was</span> one reed broad.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C40V7">&nbsp;</a>And
<span class="add">every</span> little chamber
<span class="add">was</span> one reed long, and one reed broad; and between the little chambers
<span class="add">were</span> five cubits; and the threshold of the gate by the porch of the gate within
<span class="add">was</span> one reed.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C40V8">&nbsp;</a>He measured also the porch of the gate within, one reed.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C40V9">&nbsp;</a>Then measured he the porch of the gate, eight cubits; and the posts thereof, two cubits; and the porch
of the gate
<span class="add">was</span> inward.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C40V10">&nbsp;</a>And the little chambers of the gate eastward
<span class="add">were</span> three on this side, and three on that side; they three
<span class="add">were</span> of one measure: and the posts had one measure on this side and on that side.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C40V11">&nbsp;</a>And he measured the breadth of the entry of the gate, ten cubits;
<span class="add">and</span> the length of the gate, thirteen cubits.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C40V12">&nbsp;</a>The space also before the little chambers
<span class="add">was</span> one cubit
<span class="add">on this side,</span> and the space
<span class="add">was</span> one cubit on that side: and the little chambers
<span class="add">were</span> six cubits on this side, and six cubits on that side.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C40V13">&nbsp;</a>He measured then the gate from the roof of
<span class="add">one</span> little chamber to the roof of another: the breadth
<span class="add">was</span> five and twenty cubits, door against door.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C40V14">&nbsp;</a>He made also posts of threescore cubits, even unto the post of the court round about the gate.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C40V15">&nbsp;</a>And from the face of the gate of the entrance unto the face of the porch of the inner gate
<span class="add">were</span> fifty cubits.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C40V16">&nbsp;</a>And
<span class="add">there were</span> narrow windows to the little chambers, and to their posts within the gate round about, and likewise
to the arches: and windows
<span class="add">were</span> round about inward: and upon
<span class="add">each</span> post
<span class="add">were</span> palm trees.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C40V17">&nbsp;</a>Then brought he me into the outward court, and, lo,
<span class="add">there were</span> chambers, and a pavement made for the court round about: thirty chambers
<span class="add">were</span> upon the pavement.
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C40V18">&nbsp;</a>And the pavement by the side of the gates over against the length of the gates
<span class="add">was</span> the lower pavement.
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C40V19">&nbsp;</a>Then he measured the breadth from the forefront of the lower gate unto the forefront of the inner court
without, an hundred cubits eastward and northward.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C40V20">&nbsp;</a>And the gate of the outward court that looked toward the north, he measured the length thereof, and the
breadth thereof.

<span class="add">were</span> three on this side and three on that side; and the posts thereof and the arches thereof were after the
measure of the first gate: the length thereof
<span class="add">was</span> fifty cubits, and the breadth five and twenty cubits.
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C40V22">&nbsp;</a>And their windows, and their arches, and their palm trees,
<span class="add">were</span> after the measure of the gate that looketh toward the east; and they went up unto it by seven steps;
and the arches thereof
<span class="add">were</span> before them.
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C40V23">&nbsp;</a>And the gate of the inner court
<span class="add">was</span> over against the gate toward the north, and toward the east; and he measured from gate to gate an hundred
cubits.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C40V24">&nbsp;</a>After that he brought me toward the south, and behold a gate toward the south: and he measured the posts
thereof and the arches thereof according to these measures.

<span class="add">there were</span> windows in it and in the arches thereof round about, like those windows: the length
<span class="add">was</span> fifty cubits, and the breadth five and twenty cubits.

cubits.
 <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C40V28">&nbsp;</a>And he brought me to the inner court by the south gate: and he measured the south gate according to these
measures;
 <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C40V29">&nbsp;</a>And the little chambers thereof, and the posts thereof, and the arches thereof, according to these measures:
and

<span class="add">having</span> the prospect toward the north.
 <span class="verse"> 45</span><a name="C40V45">&nbsp;</a>And he said unto me, This chamber, whose prospect
