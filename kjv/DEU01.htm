<div class="mt1">The Fifth Book of Moses, called Deuteronomy
</div>
<div class="chapterlabel"> 1</div><div class="p">
 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C1V1">&nbsp;</a>These
<span class="add">be</span> the words which Moses spake unto all Israel on this side Jordan in the wilderness, in the plain over
against the Red
<span class="add">sea,
</span> between Paran, and Tophel, and Laban, and Hazeroth, and Dizahab.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C1V2">&nbsp;</a>(<span class="add">There are</span> eleven days’
<span class="add">journey</span> from Horeb by the way of mount Seir unto Kadesh-barnea.)
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C1V3">&nbsp;</a>And it came to pass in the fortieth year, in the eleventh month, on the first
<span class="add">day</span> of the month,
<span class="add">that</span> Moses spake unto the children of Israel, according unto all that the LORD had given him in commandment
unto them;
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C1V4">&nbsp;</a>After he had slain Sihon the king of the Amorites, which dwelt in Heshbon, and Og the king of Bashan,
which dwelt at Astaroth in Edrei:
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C1V5">&nbsp;</a>On this side Jordan, in the land of Moab, began Moses to declare this law, saying,
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C1V6">&nbsp;</a>The LORD our God spake unto us in Horeb, saying, Ye have dwelt long enough in this mount:
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C1V7">&nbsp;</a>Turn you, and take your journey, and go to the mount of the Amorites, and unto all
<span class="add">the places</span> nigh thereunto, in the plain, in the hills, and in the vale, and in the south, and by the sea side,
to the land of the Canaanites, and unto Lebanon, unto the great river, the river Euphrates.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C1V8">&nbsp;</a>Behold, I have set the land before you: go in and possess the land which the LORD sware unto your fathers,
Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, to give unto them and to their seed after them.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C1V9">&nbsp;</a>And I spake unto you at that time, saying, I am not able to bear you myself alone:
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C1V10">&nbsp;</a>The LORD your God hath multiplied you, and, behold, ye
<span class="add">are
</span> this day as the stars of heaven for multitude.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C1V11">&nbsp;</a>(The LORD God of your fathers make you a thousand times so many more as ye
<span class="add">are,</span> and bless you, as he hath promised you!)
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C1V12">&nbsp;</a>How can I myself alone bear your cumbrance, and your burden, and your strife?
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C1V13">&nbsp;</a>Take you wise men, and understanding, and known among your tribes, and I will make them rulers over you.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C1V14">&nbsp;</a>And ye answered me, and said, The thing which thou hast spoken is good
<span class="add">for us</span> to do.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C1V15">&nbsp;</a>So I took the chief of your tribes, wise men, and known, and made them heads over you, captains over
thousands, and captains over hundreds, and captains over fifties, and captains over tens, and officers
among your tribes.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C1V16">&nbsp;</a>And I charged your judges at that time, saying, Hear
<span class="add">the causes
</span> between your brethren, and judge righteously between
<span class="add">every
</span> man and his brother, and the stranger
<span class="add">that is</span> with him.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C1V17">&nbsp;</a>Ye shall not respect persons in judgment;
<span class="add">but
</span>ye shall hear the small as well as the great; ye shall not be afraid of the face of man; for the judgment
<span class="add">is
</span>God’s: and the cause that is too hard for you, bring
<span class="add">it
</span>unto me, and I will hear it.
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C1V18">&nbsp;</a>And I commanded you at that time all the things which ye should do.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C1V19">&nbsp;</a>And when we departed from Horeb, we went through all that great and terrible wilderness, which ye saw
by the way of the mountain of the Amorites, as the LORD our God commanded us; and we came to Kadesh-barnea.
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C1V20">&nbsp;</a>And I said unto you, Ye are come unto the mountain of the Amorites, which the LORD our God doth give
unto us.
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C1V21">&nbsp;</a>Behold, the LORD thy God hath set the land before thee: go up
<span class="add">and</span> possess
<span class="add">it,</span> as the LORD God of thy fathers hath said unto thee; fear not, neither be discouraged.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C1V22">&nbsp;</a>And ye came near unto me every one of you, and said, We will send men before us, and they shall search
us out the land, and bring us word again by what way we must go up, and into what cities we shall come.
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C1V23">&nbsp;</a>and the saying pleased me well: and I took twelve men of you, one of a tribe:
 <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C1V24">&nbsp;</a>And they turned and went up into the mountain, and came unto the valley of Eshcol, and searched it out.
 <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C1V25">&nbsp;</a>And they took of the fruit of the land in their hands, and brought
<span class="add">it</span> down unto us, and brought us word again, and said,
<span class="add">It is
</span> a good land which the LORD our God doth give us.
 <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C1V26">&nbsp;</a>Notwithstanding ye would not go up, but rebelled against the commandment of the LORD your God:
 <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C1V27">&nbsp;</a>And ye murmured in your tents, and said, Because the LORD hated us, he hath brought us forth out of the
land of Egypt, to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to destroy us.
 <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C1V28">&nbsp;</a>Whither shall we go up? our brethren have discouraged our heart, saying, The people
<span class="add">is</span> greater and taller than we; the cities
<span class="add">are
</span> great and walled up to heaven; and moreover we have seen the sons of the Anakims there.
 <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C1V29">&nbsp;</a>Then I said unto you, Dread not, neither be afraid of them.
 <span class="verse"> 30</span><a name="C1V30">&nbsp;</a>The LORD your God which goeth before you, he shall fight for you, according to all that he did for you
in Egypt before your eyes;
 <span class="verse"> 31</span><a name="C1V31">&nbsp;</a>And in the wilderness, where thou hast seen how that the LORD thy God bare thee, as a man doth bear his
son, in all the way that ye went, until ye came into this place.
 <span class="verse"> 32</span><a name="C1V32">&nbsp;</a>Yet in this thing ye did not believe the LORD your God,
 <span class="verse"> 33</span><a name="C1V33">&nbsp;</a>Who went in the way before you, to search you out a place to pitch your tents
<span class="add">in,</span> in fire by night, to shew you by what way ye should go, and in a cloud by day.
 <span class="verse"> 34</span><a name="C1V34">&nbsp;</a>And the LORD heard the voice of your words, and was wroth, and sware, saying,
 <span class="verse"> 35</span><a name="C1V35">&nbsp;</a>Surely there shall not one of these men of this evil generation see that good land, which I sware to
give unto your fathers,
 <span class="verse"> 36</span><a name="C1V36">&nbsp;</a>Save Caleb the son of Jephunneh; he shall see it, and to him will I give the land that he hath trodden
upon, and to his children, because he hath wholly followed the LORD.
 <span class="verse"> 37</span><a name="C1V37">&nbsp;</a>Also the LORD was angry with me for your sakes, saying, Thou also shalt not go in thither.
 <span class="verse"> 38</span><a name="C1V38">&nbsp;</a><span class="add">But</span> Joshua the son of Nun, which standeth before thee, he shall go in thither: encourage him: for he shall
cause Israel to inherit it.
 <span class="verse"> 39</span><a name="C1V39">&nbsp;</a>Moreover your little ones, which ye said should be a prey, and your children, which in that day had no
knowledge between good and evil, they shall go in thither, and unto them will I give it, and they shall
possess it.
 <span class="verse"> 40</span><a name="C1V40">&nbsp;</a>But
<span class="add">as for</span> you, turn you, and take your journey into the wilderness by the way of the Red sea.
 <span class="verse"> 41</span><a name="C1V41">&nbsp;</a>Then ye answered and said unto me, We have sinned against the LORD, we will go up and fight, according
to all that the LORD our God commanded us. And when ye had girded on every man his weapons of war, ye
were ready to go up into the hill.
 <span class="verse"> 42</span><a name="C1V42">&nbsp;</a>And the LORD said unto me, Say unto them, Go not up, neither fight; for I
<span class="add">am</span> not among you; lest ye be smitten before your enemies.
 <span class="verse"> 43</span><a name="C1V43">&nbsp;</a>So I spake unto you; and ye would not hear, but rebelled against the commandment of the LORD, and went
presumptuously up into the hill.
 <span class="verse"> 44</span><a name="C1V44">&nbsp;</a>And the Amorites, which dwelt in that mountain, came out against you, and chased you, as bees do, and
destroyed you in Seir,
<span class="add">even</span> unto Hormah.
 <span class="verse"> 45</span><a name="C1V45">&nbsp;</a>And ye returned and wept before the LORD; but the LORD would not hearken to your voice, nor give ear
unto you.
 <span class="verse"> 46</span><a name="C1V46">&nbsp;</a>So ye abode in Kadesh many days, according unto the days that ye abode
<span class="add">there.</span></div>
