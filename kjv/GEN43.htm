 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C43V1">&nbsp;</a>And the famine
<span class="add">was</span> sore in the land.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C43V2">&nbsp;</a>And it came to pass, when they had eaten up the corn which they had brought out of Egypt, their father
said unto them, Go again, buy us a little food.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C43V3">&nbsp;</a>And Judah spake unto him, saying, The man did solemnly protest unto us, saying, Ye shall not see my face,
except your brother
<span class="add">be</span> with you.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C43V4">&nbsp;</a>If thou wilt send our brother with us, we will go down and buy thee food:
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C43V5">&nbsp;</a>But if thou wilt not send
<span class="add">him,</span> we will not go down: for the man said unto us, Ye shall not see my face, except your brother
<span class="add">be
</span> with you.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C43V6">&nbsp;</a>And Israel said, Wherefore dealt ye so ill with me, as to tell the man whether ye had yet a brother?
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C43V7">&nbsp;</a>And they said, The man asked us straitly of our state, and of our kindred, saying,
<span class="add">Is</span> your father yet alive? have ye
<span class="add">another
</span> brother? and we told him according to the tenor of these words: could we certainly know that he would
say, Bring your brother down?
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C43V8">&nbsp;</a>And Judah said unto Israel his father, Send the lad with me, and we will arise and go; that we may live,
and not die, both we, and thou,
<span class="add">and
</span> also our little ones.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C43V9">&nbsp;</a>I will be surety for him; of my hand shalt thou require him: if I bring him not unto thee, and set him
before thee, then let me bear the blame for ever:
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C43V10">&nbsp;</a>For except we had lingered, surely now we had returned this second time.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C43V11">&nbsp;</a>And their father Israel said unto them, If
<span class="add">it must be</span> so now, do this; take of the best fruits in the land in your vessels, and carry down the man a present,
a little balm, and a little honey, spices, and myrrh, nuts, and almonds:
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C43V12">&nbsp;</a>And take double money in your hand; and the money that was brought again in the mouth of your sacks,
carry
<span class="add">it</span> again in your hand; peradventure it
<span class="add">was</span> an oversight:
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C43V13">&nbsp;</a>Take also your brother, and arise, go again unto the man:
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C43V14">&nbsp;</a>And God Almighty give you mercy before the man, that he may send away your other brother, and Benjamin.
If I be bereaved
<span class="add">of my children,
</span> I am bereaved.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C43V15">&nbsp;</a>And the men took that present, and they took double money in their hand, and Benjamin; and rose up, and
went down to Egypt, and stood before Joseph.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C43V16">&nbsp;</a>And when Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to the ruler of his house, Bring
<span class="add">these</span> men home, and slay, and make ready; for
<span class="add">these</span> men shall dine with me at noon.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C43V17">&nbsp;</a>And the man did as Joseph bade; and the man brought the men into Joseph’s house.
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C43V18">&nbsp;</a>And the men were afraid, because they were brought into Joseph’s house; and they said, Because of the
money that was returned in our sacks at the first time are we brought in; that he may seek occasion against
us, and fall upon us, and take us for bondmen, and our asses.
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C43V19">&nbsp;</a>And they came near to the steward of Joseph’s house, and they communed with him at the door of the house,
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C43V20">&nbsp;</a>And said, O sir, we came indeed down at the first time to buy food:
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C43V21">&nbsp;</a>And it came to pass, when we came to the inn, that we opened our sacks, and, behold,
<span class="add">every</span> man’s money
<span class="add">was</span> in the mouth of his sack, our money in full weight: and we have brought it again in our hand.
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C43V22">&nbsp;</a>And other money have we brought down in our hands to buy food: we cannot tell who put our money in our
sacks.
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C43V23">&nbsp;</a>And he said, Peace
<span class="add">be</span> to you, fear not: your God, and the God of your father, hath given you treasure in your sacks: I had
your money. And he brought Simeon out unto them.
 <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C43V24">&nbsp;</a>And the man brought the men into Joseph’s house, and gave
<span class="add">them
</span> water, and they washed their feet; and he gave their asses provender.
 <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C43V25">&nbsp;</a>And they made ready the present against Joseph came at noon: for they heard that they should eat bread
there.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C43V26">&nbsp;</a>And when Joseph came home, they brought him the present which
<span class="add">was</span> in their hand into the house, and bowed themselves to him to the earth.
 <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C43V27">&nbsp;</a>And he asked them of
<span class="add">their</span> welfare, and said,
<span class="add">Is
</span> your father well, the old man of whom ye spake?
<span class="add">Is</span> he yet alive?
 <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C43V28">&nbsp;</a>And they answered, Thy servant our father
<span class="add">is</span> in good health, he
<span class="add">is</span> yet alive. And they bowed down their heads, and made obeisance.
 <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C43V29">&nbsp;</a>And he lifted up his eyes, and saw his brother Benjamin, his mother’s son, and said,
<span class="add">Is</span> this your younger brother, of whom ye spake unto me? And he said, God be gracious unto thee, my son.
 <span class="verse"> 30</span><a name="C43V30">&nbsp;</a>And Joseph made haste; for his bowels did yearn upon his brother: and he sought
<span class="add">where</span> to weep; and he entered into
<span class="add">his</span> chamber, and wept there.
 <span class="verse"> 31</span><a name="C43V31">&nbsp;</a>And he washed his face, and went out, and refrained himself, and said, Set on bread.
 <span class="verse"> 32</span><a name="C43V32">&nbsp;</a>And they set on for him by himself, and for them by themselves, and for the Egyptians, which did eat
with him, by themselves: because the Egyptians might not eat bread with the Hebrews; for that
<span class="add">is</span> an abomination unto the Egyptians.
 <span class="verse"> 33</span><a name="C43V33">&nbsp;</a>And they sat before him, the firstborn according to his birthright, and the youngest according to his
youth: and the men marvelled one at another.
 <span class="verse"> 34</span><a name="C43V34">&nbsp;</a>And he took
<span class="add">and sent</span> messes unto them from before him: but Benjamin’s mess was five times so much as any of theirs. And they
drank, and were merry with him.
