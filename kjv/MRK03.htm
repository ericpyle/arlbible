 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C3V1">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And he entered again into the synagogue; and there was a man there which had a withered hand.
</span> <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C3V2">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And they watched him, whether he would heal him on the sabbath day; that they might accuse him.
</span> <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C3V3">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And he saith unto the man which had the withered hand, Stand forth.
</span> <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C3V4">&nbsp;</a>And he saith unto them,
<span class="wj">Is it lawful to do good on the sabbath days, or to do evil? to save life, or to kill?</span> But they held their peace.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C3V5">&nbsp;</a>And when he had looked round about on them with anger, being grieved for the hardness of their hearts,
he saith unto the man,
<span class="wj">Stretch forth thine hand.</span> And he stretched
<span class="add">it</span> out: and his hand was restored whole as the other.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C3V6">&nbsp;</a>And the Pharisees went forth, and straightway took counsel with the Herodians against him, how they might
destroy him.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C3V7">&nbsp;</a>But Jesus withdrew himself with his disciples to the sea: and a great multitude from Galilee followed
him, and from Judaea,
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C3V8">&nbsp;</a>And from Jerusalem, and from Idumaea, and
<span class="add">from</span> beyond Jordan; and they about Tyre and Sidon, a great multitude, when they had heard what great things
he did, came unto him.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C3V9">&nbsp;</a>And he spake to his disciples, that a small ship should wait on him because of the multitude, lest they
should throng him.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C3V10">&nbsp;</a>For he had healed many; insomuch that they pressed upon him for to touch him, as many as had plagues.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C3V11">&nbsp;</a>And unclean spirits, when they saw him, fell down before him, and cried, saying, Thou art the Son of
God.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C3V12">&nbsp;</a>And he straitly charged them that they should not make him known.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C3V13">&nbsp;</a>And he goeth up into a mountain, and calleth
<span class="add">unto him</span> whom he would: and they came unto him.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C3V14">&nbsp;</a>And he ordained twelve, that they should be with him, and that he might send them forth to preach,
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C3V15">&nbsp;</a>And to have power to heal sicknesses, and to cast out devils:
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C3V16">&nbsp;</a>And Simon he surnamed Peter;
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C3V17">&nbsp;</a>And James the
<span class="add">son</span> of Zebedee, and John the brother of James; and he surnamed them Boanerges, which is, The sons of thunder:
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C3V18">&nbsp;</a>And Andrew, and Philip, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, and Thomas, and James the
<span class="add">son</span> of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus, and Simon the Canaanite,
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C3V19">&nbsp;</a>And Judas Iscariot, which also betrayed him: and they went into an house.
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C3V20">&nbsp;</a>And the multitude cometh together again, so that they could not so much as eat bread.
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C3V21">&nbsp;</a>And when his friends heard
<span class="add">of it,</span> they went out to lay hold on him: for they said, He is beside himself.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C3V22">&nbsp;</a>And the scribes which came down from Jerusalem said, He hath Beelzebub, and by the prince of the devils
casteth he out devils.
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C3V23">&nbsp;</a>And he called them
<span class="add">unto him,</span> and said unto them in parables,
<span class="wj">How can Satan cast out Satan?
</span> <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C3V24">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And if a kingdom be divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand.
</span> <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C3V25">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And if a house be divided against itself, that house cannot stand.
</span> <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C3V26">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And if Satan rise up against himself, and be divided, he cannot stand, but hath an end.
</span> <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C3V27">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">No man can enter into a strong man’s house, and spoil his goods, except he will first bind the strong
man; and then he will spoil his house.
</span> <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C3V28">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Verily I say unto you, All sins shall be forgiven unto the sons of men, and blasphemies wherewith soever
they shall blaspheme:
</span> <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C3V29">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">But he that shall blaspheme against the Holy Ghost hath never forgiveness, but is in danger of eternal
damnation:
</span> <span class="verse"> 30</span><a name="C3V30">&nbsp;</a>Because they said, He hath an unclean spirit.

<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 31</span><a name="C3V31">&nbsp;</a>There came then his brethren and his mother, and, standing without, sent unto him, calling him.
 <span class="verse"> 32</span><a name="C3V32">&nbsp;</a>And the multitude sat about him, and they said unto him, Behold, thy mother and thy brethren without
seek for thee.
 <span class="verse"> 33</span><a name="C3V33">&nbsp;</a>And he answered them, saying,
<span class="wj">Who is my mother, or my brethren?
</span> <span class="verse"> 34</span><a name="C3V34">&nbsp;</a>And he looked round about on them which sat about him, and said,
<span class="wj">Behold my mother and my brethren!
</span> <span class="verse"> 35</span><a name="C3V35">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">For whosoever shall do the will of God, the same is my brother, and my sister, and mother.</span></div>
