 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C32V1">&nbsp;</a>And when the people saw that Moses delayed to come down out of the mount, the people gathered themselves
together unto Aaron, and said unto him, Up, make us gods, which shall go before us; for
<span class="add">as for</span> this Moses, the man that brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we wot not what is become of him.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C32V2">&nbsp;</a>And Aaron said unto them, Break off the golden earrings, which
<span class="add">are</span> in the ears of your wives, of your sons, and of your daughters, and bring
<span class="add">them</span> unto me.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C32V3">&nbsp;</a>And all the people brake off the golden earrings which
<span class="add">were</span> in their ears, and brought
<span class="add">them</span> unto Aaron.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C32V4">&nbsp;</a>And he received
<span class="add">them</span> at their hand, and fashioned it with a graving tool, after he had made it a molten calf: and they said,
These
<span class="add">be</span> thy gods, O Israel, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C32V5">&nbsp;</a>And when Aaron saw
<span class="add">it,</span> he built an altar before it; and Aaron made proclamation, and said, To morrow
<span class="add">is</span> a feast to the LORD.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C32V6">&nbsp;</a>And they rose up early on the morrow, and offered burnt offerings, and brought peace offerings; and the
people sat down to eat and to drink, and rose up to play.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C32V7">&nbsp;</a>And the LORD said unto Moses, Go, get thee down; for thy people, which thou broughtest out of the land
of Egypt, have corrupted
<span class="add">themselves:
</span> <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C32V8">&nbsp;</a>They have turned aside quickly out of the way which I commanded them: they have made them a molten calf,
and have worshipped it, and have sacrificed thereunto, and said, These
<span class="add">be</span> thy gods, O Israel, which have brought thee up out of the land of Egypt.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C32V9">&nbsp;</a>And the LORD said unto Moses, I have seen this people, and, behold, it
<span class="add">is</span> a stiffnecked people:
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C32V10">&nbsp;</a>Now therefore let me alone, that my wrath may wax hot against them, and that I may consume them: and
I will make of thee a great nation.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C32V11">&nbsp;</a>And Moses besought the LORD his God, and said, LORD, why doth thy wrath wax hot against thy people, which
thou hast brought forth out of the land of Egypt with great power, and with a mighty hand?
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C32V12">&nbsp;</a>Wherefore should the Egyptians speak, and say, For mischief did he bring them out, to slay them in the
mountains, and to consume them from the face of the earth? Turn from thy fierce wrath, and repent of
this evil against thy people.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C32V13">&nbsp;</a>Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, thy servants, to whom thou swarest by thine own self, and saidst
unto them, I will multiply your seed as the stars of heaven, and all this land that I have spoken of
will I give unto your seed, and they shall inherit
<span class="add">it</span> for ever.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C32V14">&nbsp;</a>And the LORD repented of the evil which he thought to do unto his people.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C32V15">&nbsp;</a>And Moses turned, and went down from the mount, and the two tables of the testimony
<span class="add">were</span> in his hand: the tables
<span class="add">were</span> written on both their sides; on the one side and on the other
<span class="add">were</span> they written.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C32V16">&nbsp;</a>And the tables
<span class="add">were</span> the work of God, and the writing
<span class="add">was</span> the writing of God, graven upon the tables.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C32V17">&nbsp;</a>And when Joshua heard the noise of the people as they shouted, he said unto Moses,
<span class="add">There is</span> a noise of war in the camp.
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C32V18">&nbsp;</a>And he said,
<span class="add">It is</span> not the voice of
<span class="add">them that</span> shout for mastery, neither
<span class="add">is it</span> the voice of
<span class="add">them that</span> cry for being overcome:
<span class="add">but</span> the noise of
<span class="add">them that</span> sing do I hear.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C32V19">&nbsp;</a>And it came to pass, as soon as he came nigh unto the camp, that he saw the calf, and the dancing: and
Moses’ anger waxed hot, and he cast the tables out of his hands, and brake them beneath the mount.
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C32V20">&nbsp;</a>And he took the calf which they had made, and burnt
<span class="add">it</span> in the fire, and ground
<span class="add">it</span> to powder, and strawed
<span class="add">it</span> upon the water, and made the children of Israel drink
<span class="add">of it.
</span> <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C32V21">&nbsp;</a>And Moses said unto Aaron, What did this people unto thee, that thou hast brought so great a sin upon
them?
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C32V22">&nbsp;</a>And Aaron said, Let not the anger of my lord wax hot: thou knowest the people, that they are
<span class="add">set</span> on mischief.
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C32V23">&nbsp;</a>For they said unto me, Make us gods, which shall go before us: for
<span class="add">as for</span> this Moses, the man that brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we wot not what is become of him.
 <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C32V24">&nbsp;</a>And I said unto them, Whosoever hath any gold, let them break
<span class="add">it</span> off. So they gave
<span class="add">it</span> me: then I cast it into the fire, and there came out this calf.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C32V25">&nbsp;</a>And when Moses saw that the people
<span class="add">were</span> naked; (for Aaron had made them naked unto
<span class="add">their</span> shame among their enemies:)
 <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C32V26">&nbsp;</a>Then Moses stood in the gate of the camp, and said, Who
<span class="add">is</span> on the LORD’S side?
<span class="add">let him come</span> unto me. And all the sons of Levi gathered themselves together unto him.
 <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C32V27">&nbsp;</a>And he said unto them, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Put every man his sword by his side,
<span class="add">and</span> go in and out from gate to gate throughout the camp, and slay every man his brother, and every man his
companion, and every man his neighbour.
 <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C32V28">&nbsp;</a>And the children of Levi did according to the word of Moses: and there fell of the people that day about
three thousand men.
 <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C32V29">&nbsp;</a>For Moses had said, Consecrate yourselves to day to the LORD, even every man upon his son, and upon his
brother; that he may bestow upon you a blessing this day.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 30</span><a name="C32V30">&nbsp;</a>And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses said unto the people, Ye have sinned a great sin: and now
I will go up unto the LORD; peradventure I shall make an atonement for your sin.
 <span class="verse"> 31</span><a name="C32V31">&nbsp;</a>And Moses returned unto the LORD, and said, Oh, this people have sinned a great sin, and have made them
gods of gold.
 <span class="verse"> 32</span><a name="C32V32">&nbsp;</a>Yet now, if thou wilt forgive their sin—; and if not, blot me, I pray thee, out of thy book which thou
hast written.
 <span class="verse"> 33</span><a name="C32V33">&nbsp;</a>And the LORD said unto Moses, Whosoever hath sinned against me, him will I blot out of my book.
 <span class="verse"> 34</span><a name="C32V34">&nbsp;</a>Therefore now go, lead the people unto
<span class="add">the place</span> of which I have spoken unto thee: behold, mine Angel shall go before thee: nevertheless in the day when
I visit I will visit their sin upon them.
 <span class="verse"> 35</span><a name="C32V35">&nbsp;</a>And the LORD plagued the people, because they made the calf, which Aaron made.
