 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C16V1">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">These things have I spoken unto you, that ye should not be offended.
</span> <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C16V2">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">They shall put you out of the synagogues: yea, the time cometh, that whosoever killeth you will think
that he doeth God service.
</span> <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C16V3">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And these things will they do unto you, because they have not known the Father, nor me.
</span> <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C16V4">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">But these things have I told you, that when the time shall come, ye may remember that I told you of them.
And these things I said not unto you at the beginning, because I was with you.
</span> <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C16V5">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">But now I go my way to him that sent me; and none of you asketh me, Whither goest thou?
</span> <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C16V6">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">But because I have said these things unto you, sorrow hath filled your heart.
</span> <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C16V7">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Nevertheless I tell you the truth; It is expedient for you that I go away: for if I go not away, the
Comforter will not come unto you; but if I depart, I will send him unto you.
</span> <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C16V8">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And when he is come, he will reprove the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment:
</span> <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C16V9">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Of sin, because they believe not on me;
</span> <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C16V10">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Of righteousness, because I go to my Father, and ye see me no more;
</span> <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C16V11">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Of judgment, because the prince of this world is judged.
</span> <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C16V12">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">I have yet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them now.
</span> <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C16V13">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Howbeit when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you into all truth: for he shall not speak
of himself; but whatsoever he shall hear,
that shall he speak: and he will shew you things to come.
</span> <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C16V14">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">He shall glorify me: for he shall receive of mine, and shall shew
it unto you.
</span> <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C16V15">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">All things that the Father hath are mine: therefore said I, that he shall take of mine, and shall shew
it unto you.
</span> <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C16V16">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">A little while, and ye shall not see me: and again, a little while, and ye shall see me, because I go
to the Father.
</span> <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C16V17">&nbsp;</a>Then said
<span class="add">some</span> of his disciples among themselves, What is this that he saith unto us, A little while, and ye shall
not see me: and again, a little while, and ye shall see me: and, Because I go to the Father?
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C16V18">&nbsp;</a>They said therefore, What is this that he saith, A little while? we cannot tell what he saith.
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C16V19">&nbsp;</a>Now Jesus knew that they were desirous to ask him, and said unto them,
<span class="wj">Do ye enquire among yourselves of that I said, A little while, and ye shall not see me: and again, a
little while, and ye shall see me?
</span> <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C16V20">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Verily, verily, I say unto you, That ye shall weep and lament, but the world shall rejoice: and ye shall
be sorrowful, but your sorrow shall be turned into joy.
</span> <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C16V21">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">A woman when she is in travail hath sorrow, because her hour is come: but as soon as she is delivered
of the child, she remembereth no more the anguish, for joy that a man is born into the world.
</span> <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C16V22">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And ye now therefore have sorrow: but I will see you again, and your heart shall rejoice, and your joy
no man taketh from you.
</span> <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C16V23">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And in that day ye shall ask me nothing. Verily, verily, I say unto you, Whatsoever ye shall ask the
Father in my name, he will give
it you.
</span> <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C16V24">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Hitherto have ye asked nothing in my name: ask, and ye shall receive, that your joy may be full.
</span> <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C16V25">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">These things have I spoken unto you in proverbs: but the time cometh, when I shall no more speak unto
you in proverbs, but I shall shew you plainly of the Father.
</span> <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C16V26">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">At that day ye shall ask in my name: and I say not unto you, that I will pray the Father for you:
</span> <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C16V27">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">For the Father himself loveth you, because ye have loved me, and have believed that I came out from God.
</span> <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C16V28">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">I came forth from the Father, and am come into the world: again, I leave the world, and go to the Father.
</span> <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C16V29">&nbsp;</a>His disciples said unto him, Lo, now speakest thou plainly, and speakest no proverb.
 <span class="verse"> 30</span><a name="C16V30">&nbsp;</a>Now are we sure that thou knowest all things, and needest not that any man should ask thee: by this we
believe that thou camest forth from God.
 <span class="verse"> 31</span><a name="C16V31">&nbsp;</a>Jesus answered them,
<span class="wj">Do ye now believe?
</span> <span class="verse"> 32</span><a name="C16V32">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Behold, the hour cometh, yea, is now come, that ye shall be scattered, every man to his own, and shall
leave me alone: and yet I am not alone, because the Father is with me.
</span> <span class="verse"> 33</span><a name="C16V33">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">These things I have spoken unto you, that in me ye might have peace. In the world ye shall have tribulation:
but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world.</span></div>
