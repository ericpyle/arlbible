 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C31V1">&nbsp;</a>Now the Philistines fought against Israel: and the men of Israel fled from before the Philistines, and
fell down slain in mount Gilboa.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C31V2">&nbsp;</a>And the Philistines followed hard upon Saul and upon his sons; and the Philistines slew Jonathan, and
Abinadab, and Melchi-shua, Saul’s sons.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C31V3">&nbsp;</a>And the battle went sore against Saul, and the archers hit him; and he was sore wounded of the archers.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C31V4">&nbsp;</a>Then said Saul unto his armourbearer, Draw thy sword, and thrust me through therewith; lest these uncircumcised
come and thrust me through, and abuse me. But his armourbearer would not; for he was sore afraid. Therefore
Saul took a sword, and fell upon it.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C31V5">&nbsp;</a>And when his armourbearer saw that Saul was dead, he fell likewise upon his sword, and died with him.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C31V6">&nbsp;</a>So Saul died, and his three sons, and his armourbearer, and all his men, that same day together.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C31V7">&nbsp;</a>And when the men of Israel that
<span class="add">were</span> on the other side of the valley, and
<span class="add">they</span> that
<span class="add">were</span> on the other side Jordan, saw that the men of Israel fled, and that Saul and his sons were dead, they
forsook the cities, and fled; and the Philistines came and dwelt in them.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C31V8">&nbsp;</a>And it came to pass on the morrow, when the Philistines came to strip the slain, that they found Saul
and his three sons fallen in mount Gilboa.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C31V9">&nbsp;</a>And they cut off his head, and stripped off his armour, and sent into the land of the Philistines round
about, to publish
<span class="add">it in</span> the house of their idols, and among the people.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C31V10">&nbsp;</a>And they put his armour in the house of Ashtaroth: and they fastened his body to the wall of Beth-shan.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C31V11">&nbsp;</a>And when the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead heard of that which the Philistines had done to Saul;
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C31V12">&nbsp;</a>All the valiant men arose, and went all night, and took the body of Saul and the bodies of his sons from
the wall of Beth-shan, and came to Jabesh, and burnt them there.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C31V13">&nbsp;</a>And they took their bones, and buried
<span class="add">them</span> under a tree at Jabesh, and fasted seven days.
