<div><a name="C4V0"><hr></a>
<div class="chapterlabel"> 4</div><div class="p">
 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C4V1">&nbsp;</a>This is the book of the commandments of God, and the law that endureth for ever: all they that keep it
shall come to life; but such as leave it shall die.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C4V2">&nbsp;</a>Turn thee, O Jacob, and take hold of it: walk in the presence of the light thereof, that thou mayest
be illuminated.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C4V3">&nbsp;</a>Give not thine honour to another, nor the things that are profitable unto thee to a strange nation.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C4V4">&nbsp;</a>O Israel, happy are we: for things that are pleasing to God are made known unto us.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C4V5">&nbsp;</a>Be of good cheer, my people, the memorial of Israel.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C4V6">&nbsp;</a>Ye were sold to the nations, not for
<span class="add">your</span> destruction: but because ye moved God to wrath, ye were delivered unto the enemies.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C4V7">&nbsp;</a>For ye provoked him that made you by sacrificing unto devils, and not to God.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C4V8">&nbsp;</a>Ye have forgotten the everlasting God, that brought you up; and ye have grieved Jerusalem, that nursed
you.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C4V9">&nbsp;</a>For when she saw the wrath of God coming upon you, she said, Hearken, O ye that dwell about Sion: God
hath brought upon me great mourning;
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C4V10">&nbsp;</a>For I saw the captivity of my sons and daughters, which the Everlasting brought upon them.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C4V11">&nbsp;</a>With joy did I nourish them; but sent them away with weeping and mourning.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C4V12">&nbsp;</a>Let no man rejoice over me, a widow, and forsaken of many, who for the sins of my children am left desolate;
because they departed from the law of God.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C4V13">&nbsp;</a>They knew not his statutes, nor walked in the ways of his commandments, nor trod in the paths of discipline
in his righteousness.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C4V14">&nbsp;</a>Let them that dwell about Sion come, and remember ye the captivity of my sons and daughters, which the
Everlasting hath brought upon them.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C4V15">&nbsp;</a>For he hath brought a nation upon them from far, a shameless nation, and of a strange language, who neither
reverenced old man, nor pitied child.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C4V16">&nbsp;</a>These have carried away the dear beloved children of the widow, and left her that was alone desolate
without daughters.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C4V17">&nbsp;</a>But what can I help you?
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C4V18">&nbsp;</a>For he that brought these plagues upon you will deliver you from the hands of your enemies.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C4V19">&nbsp;</a>Go your way, O my children, go your way: for I am left desolate.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C4V20">&nbsp;</a>I have put off the clothing of peace, and put upon me the sackcloth of my prayer: I will cry unto the
Everlasting in my days.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C4V21">&nbsp;</a>Be of good cheer, O my children, cry unto the Lord, and he will deliver you from the power and hand of
the enemies.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C4V22">&nbsp;</a>For my hope is in the Everlasting, that he will save you; and joy is come unto me from the Holy One,
because of the mercy which shall soon come unto you from the Everlasting our Saviour.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C4V23">&nbsp;</a>For I sent you out with mourning and weeping: but God will give you to me again with joy and gladness
for ever.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C4V24">&nbsp;</a>Like as now the neighbours of Sion have seen your captivity: so shall they see shortly your salvation
from our God which shall come upon you with great glory, and brightness of the Everlasting.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C4V25">&nbsp;</a>My children, suffer patiently the wrath that is come upon you from God: for thine enemy hath persecuted
thee; but shortly thou shalt see his destruction, and shalt tread upon his neck.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C4V26">&nbsp;</a>My delicate ones have gone rough ways, and were taken away as a flock caught of the enemies.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C4V27">&nbsp;</a>Be of good comfort, O my children, and cry unto God: for ye shall be remembered of him that brought these
things upon you.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C4V28">&nbsp;</a>For as it was your mind to go astray from God: so, being returned, seek him ten times more.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C4V29">&nbsp;</a>For he that hath brought these plagues upon you shall bring you everlasting joy with your salvation.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 30</span><a name="C4V30">&nbsp;</a>Take a good heart, O Jerusalem: for he that gave thee that name will comfort thee.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 31</span><a name="C4V31">&nbsp;</a>Miserable are they that afflicted thee, and rejoiced at thy fall.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 32</span><a name="C4V32">&nbsp;</a>Miserable are the cities which thy children served: miserable is she that received thy sons.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 33</span><a name="C4V33">&nbsp;</a>For as she rejoiced at thy ruin, and was glad of thy fall: so shall she be grieved for her own desolation.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 34</span><a name="C4V34">&nbsp;</a>For I will take away the rejoicing of her great multitude, and her pride shall be turned into mourning.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 35</span><a name="C4V35">&nbsp;</a>For fire shall come upon her from the Everlasting, long to endure; and she shall be inhabited of devils
for a great time.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 36</span><a name="C4V36">&nbsp;</a>O Jerusalem, look about thee toward the east, and behold the joy that cometh unto thee from God.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 37</span><a name="C4V37">&nbsp;</a>Lo, thy sons come, whom thou sentest away, they come gathered together from the east to the west by the
word of the Holy One, rejoicing in the glory of God.
