 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C13V1">&nbsp;</a>Now Joshua was old
<span class="add">and</span> stricken in years; and the LORD said unto him, Thou art old
<span class="add">and</span> stricken in years, and there remaineth yet very much land to be possessed.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C13V2">&nbsp;</a>This
<span class="add">is</span> the land that yet remaineth: all the borders of the Philistines, and all Geshuri,
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C13V3">&nbsp;</a>From Sihor, which
<span class="add">is</span> before Egypt, even unto the borders of Ekron northward,
<span class="add">which</span> is counted to the Canaanite: five lords of the Philistines; the Gazathites, and the Ashdothites, the
Eshkalonites, the Gittites, and the Ekronites; also the Avites:
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C13V4">&nbsp;</a>From the south, all the land of the Canaanites, and Mearah that
<span class="add">is</span> beside the Sidonians, unto Aphek, to the borders of the Amorites:
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C13V5">&nbsp;</a>And the land of the Giblites, and all Lebanon, toward the sunrising, from Baal-gad under mount Hermon
unto the entering into Hamath.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C13V6">&nbsp;</a>All the inhabitants of the hill country from Lebanon unto Misrephoth-maim,
<span class="add">and</span> all the Sidonians, them will I drive out from before the children of Israel: only divide thou it by
lot unto the Israelites for an inheritance, as I have commanded thee.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C13V7">&nbsp;</a>Now therefore divide this land for an inheritance unto the nine tribes, and the half tribe of Manasseh,
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C13V8">&nbsp;</a>With whom the Reubenites and the Gadites have received their inheritance, which Moses gave them, beyond
Jordan eastward,
<span class="add">even</span> as Moses the servant of the LORD gave them;
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C13V9">&nbsp;</a>From Aroer, that
<span class="add">is</span> upon the bank of the river Arnon, and the city that
<span class="add">is</span> in the midst of the river, and all the plain of Medeba unto Dibon;
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C13V10">&nbsp;</a>And all the cities of Sihon king of the Amorites, which reigned in Heshbon, unto the border of the children
of Ammon;
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C13V11">&nbsp;</a>And Gilead, and the border of the Geshurites and Maachathites, and all mount Hermon, and all Bashan unto
Salcah;
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C13V12">&nbsp;</a>All the kingdom of Og in Bashan, which reigned in Ashtaroth and in Edrei, who remained of the remnant
of the giants: for these did Moses smite, and cast them out.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C13V13">&nbsp;</a>Nevertheless the children of Israel expelled not the Geshurites, nor the Maachathites: but the Geshurites
and the Maachathites dwell among the Israelites until this day.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C13V14">&nbsp;</a>Only unto the tribe of Levi he gave none inheritance; the sacrifices of the LORD God of Israel made by
fire
<span class="add">are</span> their inheritance, as he said unto them.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C13V15">&nbsp;</a>And Moses gave unto the tribe of the children of Reuben
<span class="add">inheritance
</span> according to their families.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C13V16">&nbsp;</a>And their coast was from Aroer, that
<span class="add">is</span> on the bank of the river Arnon, and the city that
<span class="add">is</span> in the midst of the river, and all the plain by Medeba;
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C13V17">&nbsp;</a>Heshbon, and all her cities that
<span class="add">are</span> in the plain; Dibon, and Bamoth- baal, and Beth-baal-meon,
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C13V18">&nbsp;</a>And Jahaza, and Kedemoth, and Mephaath,
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C13V19">&nbsp;</a>And Kirjathaim, and Sibmah, and Zareth-shahar in the mount of the valley,
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C13V20">&nbsp;</a>And Beth- peor, and Ashdoth-pisgah, and Beth-jeshimoth,
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C13V21">&nbsp;</a>And all the cities of the plain, and all the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites, which reigned in
Heshbon, whom Moses smote with the princes of Midian, Evi, and Rekem, and Zur, and Hur, and Reba,
<span class="add">which were
</span> dukes of Sihon, dwelling in the country.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C13V22">&nbsp;</a>Balaam also the son of Beor, the soothsayer, did the children of Israel slay with the sword among them
that were slain by them.
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C13V23">&nbsp;</a>And the border of the children of Reuben was Jordan, and the border
<span class="add">thereof.</span> This
<span class="add">was</span> the inheritance of the children of Reuben after their families, the cities and the villages thereof.
 <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C13V24">&nbsp;</a>And Moses gave
<span class="add">inheritance</span> unto the tribe of Gad,
<span class="add">even
</span> unto the children of Gad according to their families.
 <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C13V25">&nbsp;</a>And their coast was Jazer, and all the cities of Gilead, and half the land of the children of Ammon,
unto Aroer that
<span class="add">is</span> before Rabbah;
 <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C13V26">&nbsp;</a>And from Heshbon unto Ramath-mizpeh, and Betonim; and from Mahanaim unto the border of Debir;
 <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C13V27">&nbsp;</a>And in the valley, Beth-aram, and Beth-nimrah, and Succoth, and Zaphon, the rest of the kingdom of Sihon
king of Heshbon, Jordan and
<span class="add">his
</span> border,
<span class="add">even</span> unto the edge of the sea of Chinnereth on the other side Jordan eastward.
 <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C13V28">&nbsp;</a>This
<span class="add">is</span> the inheritance of the children of Gad after their families, the cities, and their villages.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C13V29">&nbsp;</a>And Moses gave
<span class="add">inheritance</span> unto the half tribe of Manasseh: and
<span class="add">this</span> was
<span class="add">the possession</span> of the half tribe of the children of Manasseh by their families.
 <span class="verse"> 30</span><a name="C13V30">&nbsp;</a>And their coast was from Mahanaim, all Bashan, all the kingdom of Og king of Bashan, and all the towns
of Jair, which are in Bashan, threescore cities:
 <span class="verse"> 31</span><a name="C13V31">&nbsp;</a>And half Gilead, and Ashtaroth, and Edrei, cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan,
<span class="add">were pertaining</span> unto the children of Machir the son of Manasseh, even to the one half of the children of Machir by their
families.
 <span class="verse"> 32</span><a name="C13V32">&nbsp;</a>These
<span class="add">are the countries</span> which Moses did distribute for inheritance in the plains of Moab, on the other side Jordan, by Jericho,
eastward.
 <span class="verse"> 33</span><a name="C13V33">&nbsp;</a>But unto the tribe of Levi Moses gave not
<span class="add">any</span> inheritance: the LORD God of Israel
<span class="add">was</span> their inheritance, as he said unto them.
