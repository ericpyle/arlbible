 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C2V1">&nbsp;</a>Thus saith the LORD; For three transgressions of Moab, and for four, I will not turn away
<span class="add">the punishment</span> thereof; because he burned the bones of the king of Edom into lime:
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C2V2">&nbsp;</a>But I will send a fire upon Moab, and it shall devour the palaces of Kirioth: and Moab shall die with
tumult, with shouting,
<span class="add">and</span> with the sound of the trumpet:
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C2V3">&nbsp;</a>And I will cut off the judge from the midst thereof, and will slay all the princes thereof with him,
saith the LORD.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C2V4">&nbsp;</a>Thus saith the LORD; For three transgressions of Judah, and for four, I will not turn away
<span class="add">the punishment</span> thereof; because they have despised the law of the LORD, and have not kept his commandments, and their
lies caused them to err, after the which their fathers have walked:
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C2V5">&nbsp;</a>But I will send a fire upon Judah, and it shall devour the palaces of Jerusalem.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C2V6">&nbsp;</a>Thus saith the LORD; For three transgressions of Israel, and for four, I will not turn away
<span class="add">the punishment</span> thereof; because they sold the righteous for silver, and the poor for a pair of shoes;
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C2V7">&nbsp;</a>That pant after the dust of the earth on the head of the poor, and turn aside the way of the meek: and
a man and his father will go in unto the
<span class="add">same</span> maid, to profane my holy name:
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C2V8">&nbsp;</a>And they lay
<span class="add">themselves</span> down upon clothes laid to pledge by every altar, and they drink the wine of the condemned in the house
of their god.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C2V9">&nbsp;</a>Yet destroyed I the Amorite before them, whose height
<span class="add">was
</span> like the height of the cedars, and he
<span class="add">was</span> strong as the oaks; yet I destroyed his fruit from above, and his roots from beneath.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C2V10">&nbsp;</a>Also I brought you up from the land of Egypt, and led you forty years through the wilderness, to possess
the land of the Amorite.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C2V11">&nbsp;</a>And I raised up of your sons for prophets, and of your young men for Nazarites.
<span class="add">Is it</span> not even thus, O ye children of Israel? saith the LORD.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C2V12">&nbsp;</a>But ye gave the Nazarites wine to drink; and commanded the prophets, saying, Prophesy not.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C2V13">&nbsp;</a>Behold, I am pressed under you, as a cart is pressed
<span class="add">that is
</span> full of sheaves.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C2V14">&nbsp;</a>Therefore the flight shall perish from the swift, and the strong shall not strengthen his force, neither
shall the mighty deliver himself:
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C2V15">&nbsp;</a>Neither shall he stand that handleth the bow; and
<span class="add">he that is
</span> swift of foot shall not deliver
<span class="add">himself:</span> neither shall he that rideth the horse deliver himself.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C2V16">&nbsp;</a>And
<span class="add">he that is</span> courageous among the mighty shall flee away naked in that day, saith the LORD.
