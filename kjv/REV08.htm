 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C8V1">&nbsp;</a>And when he had opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C8V2">&nbsp;</a>And I saw the seven angels which stood before God; and to them were given seven trumpets.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C8V3">&nbsp;</a>And another angel came and stood at the altar, having a golden censer; and there was given unto him much
incense, that he should offer
<span class="add">it</span> with the prayers of all saints upon the golden altar which was before the throne.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C8V4">&nbsp;</a>And the smoke of the incense,
<span class="add">which came</span> with the prayers of the saints, ascended up before God out of the angel’s hand.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C8V5">&nbsp;</a>And the angel took the censer, and filled it with fire of the altar, and cast
<span class="add">it</span> into the earth: and there were voices, and thunderings, and lightnings, and an earthquake.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C8V6">&nbsp;</a>And the seven angels which had the seven trumpets prepared themselves to sound.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C8V7">&nbsp;</a>The first angel sounded, and there followed hail and fire mingled with blood, and they were cast upon
the earth: and the third part of trees was burnt up, and all green grass was burnt up.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C8V8">&nbsp;</a>And the second angel sounded, and as it were a great mountain burning with fire was cast into the sea:
and the third part of the sea became blood;
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C8V9">&nbsp;</a>And the third part of the creatures which were in the sea, and had life, died; and the third part of
the ships were destroyed.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C8V10">&nbsp;</a>And the third angel sounded, and there fell a great star from heaven, burning as it were a lamp, and
it fell upon the third part of the rivers, and upon the fountains of waters;
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C8V11">&nbsp;</a>And the name of the star is called Wormwood: and the third part of the waters became wormwood; and many
men died of the waters, because they were made bitter.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C8V12">&nbsp;</a>And the fourth angel sounded, and the third part of the sun was smitten, and the third part of the moon,
and the third part of the stars; so as the third part of them was darkened, and the day shone not for
a third part of it, and the night likewise.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C8V13">&nbsp;</a>And I beheld, and heard an angel flying through the midst of heaven, saying with a loud voice, Woe, woe,
woe, to the inhabiters of the earth by reason of the other voices of the trumpet of the three angels,
which are yet to sound!
