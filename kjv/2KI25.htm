 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C25V1">&nbsp;</a>And it came to pass in the ninth year of his reign, in the tenth month, in the tenth
<span class="add">day</span> of the month,
<span class="add">that</span> Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came, he, and all his host, against Jerusalem, and pitched against it;
and they built forts against it round about.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C25V2">&nbsp;</a>And the city was besieged unto the eleventh year of king Zedekiah.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C25V3">&nbsp;</a>And on the ninth
<span class="add">day</span> of the
<span class="add">fourth</span> month the famine prevailed in the city, and there was no bread for the people of the land.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C25V4">&nbsp;</a>And the city was broken up, and all the men of war
<span class="add">fled</span> by night by the way of the gate between two walls, which
<span class="add">is</span> by the king’s garden: (now the Chaldees
<span class="add">were</span> against the city round about:) and
<span class="add">the king</span> went the way toward the plain.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C25V5">&nbsp;</a>And the army of the Chaldees pursued after the king, and overtook him in the plains of Jericho: and all
his army were scattered from him.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C25V6">&nbsp;</a>So they took the king, and brought him up to the king of Babylon to Riblah; and they gave judgment upon
him.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C25V7">&nbsp;</a>And they slew the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes, and put out the eyes of Zedekiah, and bound him with
fetters of brass, and carried him to Babylon.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C25V8">&nbsp;</a>And in the fifth month, on the seventh
<span class="add">day</span> of the month, which
<span class="add">is</span> the nineteenth year of king Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, came Nebuzar-adan, captain of the guard,
a servant of the king of Babylon, unto Jerusalem:
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C25V9">&nbsp;</a>And he burnt the house of the LORD, and the king’s house, and all the houses of Jerusalem, and every
great
<span class="add">man’s</span> house burnt he with fire.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C25V10">&nbsp;</a>And all the army of the Chaldees, that
<span class="add">were with</span> the captain of the guard, brake down the walls of Jerusalem round about.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C25V11">&nbsp;</a>Now the rest of the people
<span class="add">that were</span> left in the city, and the fugitives that fell away to the king of Babylon, with the remnant of the multitude,
did Nebuzar-adan the captain of the guard carry away.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C25V12">&nbsp;</a>But the captain of the guard left of the poor of the land
<span class="add">to be</span> vinedressers and husbandmen.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C25V13">&nbsp;</a>And the pillars of brass that
<span class="add">were</span> in the house of the LORD, and the bases, and the brasen sea that
<span class="add">was</span> in the house of the LORD, did the Chaldees break in pieces, and carried the brass of them to Babylon.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C25V14">&nbsp;</a>And the pots, and the shovels, and the snuffers, and the spoons, and all the vessels of brass wherewith
they ministered, took they away.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C25V15">&nbsp;</a>And the firepans, and the bowls,
<span class="add">and</span> such things as
<span class="add">were</span> of gold,
<span class="add">in</span> gold, and of silver,
<span class="add">in</span> silver, the captain of the guard took away.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C25V16">&nbsp;</a>The two pillars, one sea, and the bases which Solomon had made for the house of the LORD; the brass of
all these vessels was without weight.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C25V17">&nbsp;</a>The height of the one pillar
<span class="add">was</span> eighteen cubits, and the chapiter upon it
<span class="add">was</span> brass: and the height of the chapiter three cubits; and the wreathen work, and pomegranates upon the
chapiter round about, all of brass: and like unto these had the second pillar with wreathen work.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C25V18">&nbsp;</a>And the captain of the guard took Seraiah the chief priest, and Zephaniah the second priest, and the
three keepers of the door:
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C25V19">&nbsp;</a>And out of the city he took an officer that was set over the men of war, and five men of them that were
in the king’s presence, which were found in the city, and the principal scribe of the host, which mustered
the people of the land, and threescore men of the people of the land
<span class="add">that were</span> found in the city:
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C25V20">&nbsp;</a>And Nebuzar-adan captain of the guard took these, and brought them to the king of Babylon to Riblah:
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C25V21">&nbsp;</a>And the king of Babylon smote them, and slew them at Riblah in the land of Hamath. So Judah was carried
away out of their land.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C25V22">&nbsp;</a>And
<span class="add">as for</span> the people that remained in the land of Judah, whom Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had left, even over
them he made Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, ruler.
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C25V23">&nbsp;</a>And when all the captains of the armies, they and their men, heard that the king of Babylon had made
Gedaliah governor, there came to Gedaliah to Mizpah, even Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and Johanan the
son of Careah, and Seraiah the son of Tanhumeth the Netophathite, and Jaazaniah the son of a Maachathite,
they and their men.
 <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C25V24">&nbsp;</a>And Gedaliah sware to them, and to their men, and said unto them, Fear not to be the servants of the
Chaldees: dwell in the land, and serve the king of Babylon; and it shall be well with you.
 <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C25V25">&nbsp;</a>But it came to pass in the seventh month, that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, the son of Elishama, of
the seed royal, came, and ten men with him, and smote Gedaliah, that he died, and the Jews and the Chaldees
that were with him at Mizpah.
 <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C25V26">&nbsp;</a>And all the people, both small and great, and the captains of the armies, arose, and came to Egypt: for
they were afraid of the Chaldees.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C25V27">&nbsp;</a>And it came to pass in the seven and thirtieth year of the captivity of Jehoiachin king of Judah, in
the twelfth month, on the seven and twentieth
<span class="add">day</span> of the month,
<span class="add">that</span> Evil-merodach king of Babylon in the year that he began to reign did lift up the head of Jehoiachin
king of Judah out of prison;
 <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C25V28">&nbsp;</a>And he spake kindly to him, and set his throne above the throne of the kings that
<span class="add">were</span> with him in Babylon;
 <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C25V29">&nbsp;</a>And changed his prison garments: and he did eat bread continually before him all the days of his life.
 <span class="verse"> 30</span><a name="C25V30">&nbsp;</a>And his allowance
<span class="add">was</span> a continual allowance given him of the king, a daily rate for every day, all the days of his life.
