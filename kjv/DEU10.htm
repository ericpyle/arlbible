 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C10V1">&nbsp;</a>At that time the LORD said unto me, Hew thee two tables of stone like unto the first, and come up unto
me into the mount, and make thee an ark of wood.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C10V2">&nbsp;</a>And I will write on the tables the words that were in the first tables which thou brakest, and thou shalt
put them in the ark.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C10V3">&nbsp;</a>And I made an ark
<span class="add">of</span> shittim wood, and hewed two tables of stone like unto the first, and went up into the mount, having
the two tables in mine hand.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C10V4">&nbsp;</a>And he wrote on the tables, according to the first writing, the ten commandments, which the LORD spake
unto you in the mount out of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly: and the LORD gave them
unto me.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C10V5">&nbsp;</a>And I turned myself and came down from the mount, and put the tables in the ark which I had made; and
there they be, as the LORD commanded me.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C10V6">&nbsp;</a>And the children of Israel took their journey from Beeroth of the children of Jaakan to Mosera: there
Aaron died, and there he was buried; and Eleazar his son ministered in the priest’s office in his stead.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C10V7">&nbsp;</a>From thence they journeyed unto Gudgodah; and from Gudgodah to Jotbath, a land of rivers of waters.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C10V8">&nbsp;</a>At that time the LORD separated the tribe of Levi, to bear the ark of the covenant of the LORD, to stand
before the LORD to minister unto him, and to bless in his name, unto this day.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C10V9">&nbsp;</a>Wherefore Levi hath no part nor inheritance with his brethren; the LORD
<span class="add">is</span> his inheritance, according as the LORD thy God promised him.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C10V10">&nbsp;</a>And I stayed in the mount, according to the first time, forty days and forty nights; and the LORD hearkened
unto me at that time also,
<span class="add">and</span> the LORD would not destroy thee.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C10V11">&nbsp;</a>And the LORD said unto me, Arise, take
<span class="add">thy</span> journey before the people, that they may go in and possess the land, which I sware unto their fathers
to give unto them.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C10V12">&nbsp;</a>And now, Israel, what doth the LORD thy God require of thee, but to fear the LORD thy God, to walk in
all his ways, and to love him, and to serve the LORD thy God with all thy heart and with all thy soul,
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C10V13">&nbsp;</a>To keep the commandments of the LORD, and his statutes, which I command thee this day for thy good?
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C10V14">&nbsp;</a>Behold, the heaven and the heaven of heavens
<span class="add">is</span> the LORD’S thy God, the earth
<span class="add">also,</span> with all that therein
<span class="add">is.
</span> <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C10V15">&nbsp;</a>Only the LORD had a delight in thy fathers to love them, and he chose their seed after them,
<span class="add">even</span> you above all people, as
<span class="add">it is</span> this day.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C10V16">&nbsp;</a>Circumcise therefore the foreskin of your heart, and be no more stiffnecked.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C10V17">&nbsp;</a>For the LORD your God
<span class="add">is</span> God of gods, and Lord of lords, a great God, a mighty, and a terrible, which regardeth not persons,
nor taketh reward:
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C10V18">&nbsp;</a>He doth execute the judgment of the fatherless and widow, and loveth the stranger, in giving him food
and raiment.
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C10V19">&nbsp;</a>Love ye therefore the stranger: for ye were strangers in the land of Egypt.
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C10V20">&nbsp;</a>Thou shalt fear the LORD thy God; him shalt thou serve, and to him shalt thou cleave, and swear by his
name.
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C10V21">&nbsp;</a>He
<span class="add">is</span> thy praise, and he
<span class="add">is</span> thy God, that hath done for thee these great and terrible things, which thine eyes have seen.
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C10V22">&nbsp;</a>Thy fathers went down into Egypt with threescore and ten persons; and now the LORD thy God hath made
thee as the stars of heaven for multitude.
