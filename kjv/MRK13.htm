 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C13V1">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And as he went out of the temple, one of his disciples saith unto him, Master, see what manner of stones
and what buildings
</span><span class="add">are here!
</span> <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C13V2">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And Jesus answering said unto him, Seest thou these great buildings? there shall not be left one stone
upon another, that shall not be thrown down.
</span> <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C13V3">&nbsp;</a>And as he sat upon the mount of Olives over against the temple, Peter and James and John and Andrew asked
him privately,
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C13V4">&nbsp;</a>Tell us, when shall these things be? and what
<span class="add">shall be</span> the sign when all these things shall be fulfilled?
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C13V5">&nbsp;</a>And Jesus answering them began to say,
<span class="wj">Take heed lest any
</span><span class="add">man
</span><span class="wj"> deceive you:
</span> <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C13V6">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">For many shall come in my name, saying, I am
</span><span class="add">Christ;</span><span class="wj"> and shall deceive many.
</span> <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C13V7">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And when ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars, be ye not troubled: for
</span><span class="add">such things</span><span class="wj"> must needs be; but the end
</span><span class="add">shall</span><span class="wj"> not
</span><span class="add">be</span><span class="wj"> yet.
</span> <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C13V8">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom: and there shall be earthquakes in
divers places, and there shall be famines and troubles: these
</span><span class="add">are</span><span class="wj"> the beginnings of sorrows.
</span></div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C13V9">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">But take heed to yourselves: for they shall deliver you up to councils; and in the synagogues ye shall
be beaten: and ye shall be brought before rulers and kings for my sake, for a testimony against them.
</span> <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C13V10">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And the gospel must first be published among all nations.
</span> <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C13V11">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">But when they shall lead
</span><span class="add">you,</span><span class="wj"> and deliver you up, take no thought beforehand what ye shall speak, neither do ye premeditate: but whatsoever
shall be given you in that hour, that speak ye: for it is not ye that speak, but the Holy Ghost.
</span> <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C13V12">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Now the brother shall betray the brother to death, and the father the son; and children shall rise up
against
</span><span class="add">their</span><span class="wj"> parents, and shall cause them to be put to death.
</span> <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C13V13">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And ye shall be hated of all
</span><span class="add">men</span><span class="wj"> for my name’s sake: but he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved.
</span></div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C13V14">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">But when ye shall see the abomination of desolation, spoken of by Daniel the prophet, standing where
it ought not,</span> (let him that readeth understand,)
<span class="wj">then let them that be in Judaea flee to the mountains:
</span> <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C13V15">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And let him that is on the housetop not go down into the house, neither enter
</span><span class="add">therein,</span><span class="wj"> to take any thing out of his house:
</span> <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C13V16">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And let him that is in the field not turn back again for to take up his garment.
</span> <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C13V17">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">But woe to them that are with child, and to them that give suck in those days!
</span> <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C13V18">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And pray ye that your flight be not in the winter.
</span> <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C13V19">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">For
</span><span class="add">in</span><span class="wj"> those days shall be affliction, such as was not from the beginning of the creation which God created
unto this time, neither shall be.
</span> <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C13V20">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And except that the Lord had shortened those days, no flesh should be saved: but for the elect’s sake,
whom he hath chosen, he hath shortened the days.
</span> <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C13V21">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And then if any man shall say to you, Lo, here
</span><span class="add">is</span><span class="wj"> Christ; or, lo,
</span><span class="add">he is</span><span class="wj"> there; believe
</span><span class="add">him
</span><span class="wj"> not:
</span> <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C13V22">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">For false Christs and false prophets shall rise, and shall shew signs and wonders, to seduce, if
</span><span class="add">it were</span><span class="wj"> possible, even the elect.
</span> <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C13V23">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">But take ye heed: behold, I have foretold you all things.</span></div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C13V24">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">But in those days, after that tribulation, the sun shall be darkened, and the moon shall not give her
light,
</span> <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C13V25">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And the stars of heaven shall fall, and the powers that are in heaven shall be shaken.
</span> <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C13V26">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And then shall they see the Son of man coming in the clouds with great power and glory.
</span> <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C13V27">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And then shall he send his angels, and shall gather together his elect from the four winds, from the
uttermost part of the earth to the uttermost part of heaven.
</span> <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C13V28">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Now learn a parable of the fig tree; When her branch is yet tender, and putteth forth leaves, ye know
that summer is near:
</span> <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C13V29">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">So ye in like manner, when ye shall see these things come to pass, know that it is nigh,
</span><span class="add">even</span><span class="wj"> at the doors.
</span> <span class="verse"> 30</span><a name="C13V30">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Verily I say unto you, that this generation shall not pass, till all these things be done.
</span> <span class="verse"> 31</span><a name="C13V31">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Heaven and earth shall pass away: but my words shall not pass away.
</span></div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 32</span><a name="C13V32">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">But of that day and
</span><span class="add">that</span><span class="wj"> hour knoweth no man, no, not the angels which are in heaven, neither the Son, but the Father.
</span> <span class="verse"> 33</span><a name="C13V33">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Take ye heed, watch and pray: for ye know not when the time is.
</span> <span class="verse"> 34</span><a name="C13V34">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj"></span><span class="add">For the Son of man is</span><span class="wj"> as a man taking a far journey, who left his house, and gave authority to his servants, and to every
man his work, and commanded the porter to watch.
</span> <span class="verse"> 35</span><a name="C13V35">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Watch ye therefore: for ye know not when the master of the house cometh, at even, or at midnight, or
at the cockcrowing, or in the morning:
</span> <span class="verse"> 36</span><a name="C13V36">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Lest coming suddenly he find you sleeping.
</span> <span class="verse"> 37</span><a name="C13V37">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And what I say unto you I say unto all, Watch.</span></div>
