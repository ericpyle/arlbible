 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C3V1">&nbsp;</a>Put them in mind to be subject to principalities and powers, to obey magistrates, to be ready to every
good work,
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C3V2">&nbsp;</a>To speak evil of no man, to be no brawlers,
<span class="add">but</span> gentle, shewing all meekness unto all men.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C3V3">&nbsp;</a>For we ourselves also were sometimes foolish, disobedient, deceived, serving divers lusts and pleasures,
living in malice and envy, hateful,
<span class="add">and</span> hating one another.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C3V4">&nbsp;</a>But after that the kindness and love of God our Saviour toward man appeared,
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C3V5">&nbsp;</a>Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing
of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost;
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C3V6">&nbsp;</a>Which he shed on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our Saviour;
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C3V7">&nbsp;</a>That being justified by his grace, we should be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C3V8">&nbsp;</a><span class="add">This is</span> a faithful saying, and these things I will that thou affirm constantly, that they which have believed
in God might be careful to maintain good works. These things are good and profitable unto men.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C3V9">&nbsp;</a>But avoid foolish questions, and genealogies, and contentions, and strivings about the law; for they
are unprofitable and vain.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C3V10">&nbsp;</a>A man that is an heretick after the first and second admonition reject;
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C3V11">&nbsp;</a>Knowing that he that is such is subverted, and sinneth, being condemned of himself.

<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C3V12">&nbsp;</a>When I shall send Artemas unto thee, or Tychicus, be diligent to come unto me to Nicopolis: for I have
determined there to winter.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C3V13">&nbsp;</a>Bring Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on their journey diligently, that nothing be wanting unto them.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C3V14">&nbsp;</a>And let ours also learn to maintain good works for necessary uses, that they be not unfruitful.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C3V15">&nbsp;</a>All that are with me salute thee. Greet them that love us in the faith. Grace
<span class="add">be</span> with you all. Amen.
