 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C20V1">&nbsp;</a>Then answered Zophar the Naamathite, and said,
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C20V2">&nbsp;</a>Therefore do my thoughts cause me to answer, and for
<span class="add">this</span> I make haste.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C20V3">&nbsp;</a>I have heard the check of my reproach, and the spirit of my understanding causeth me to answer.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C20V4">&nbsp;</a>Knowest thou
<span class="add">not</span> this of old, since man was placed upon earth,
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C20V5">&nbsp;</a>That the triumphing of the wicked
<span class="add">is</span> short, and the joy of the hypocrite
<span class="add">but</span> for a moment?
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C20V6">&nbsp;</a>Though his excellency mount up to the heavens, and his head reach unto the clouds;
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C20V7">&nbsp;</a><span class="add">Yet</span> he shall perish for ever like his own dung: they which have seen him shall say, Where
<span class="add">is</span> he?
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C20V8">&nbsp;</a>He shall fly away as a dream, and shall not be found: yea, he shall be chased away as a vision of the
night.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C20V9">&nbsp;</a>The eye also
<span class="add">which</span> saw him shall
<span class="add">see him</span> no more; neither shall his place any more behold him.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C20V10">&nbsp;</a>His children shall seek to please the poor, and his hands shall restore their goods.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C20V11">&nbsp;</a>His bones are full
<span class="add">of the sin</span> of his youth, which shall lie down with him in the dust.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C20V12">&nbsp;</a>Though wickedness be sweet in his mouth,
<span class="add">though</span> he hide it under his tongue;
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C20V13">&nbsp;</a><span class="add">Though</span> he spare it, and forsake it not; but keep it still within his mouth:
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C20V14">&nbsp;</a><span class="add">Yet</span> his meat in his bowels is turned,
<span class="add">it is</span> the gall of asps within him.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C20V15">&nbsp;</a>He hath swallowed down riches, and he shall vomit them up again: God shall cast them out of his belly.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C20V16">&nbsp;</a>He shall suck the poison of asps: the viper’s tongue shall slay him.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C20V17">&nbsp;</a>He shall not see the rivers, the floods, the brooks of honey and butter.
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C20V18">&nbsp;</a>That which he laboured for shall he restore, and shall not swallow
<span class="add">it</span> down: according to
<span class="add">his</span> substance
<span class="add">shall</span> the restitution
<span class="add">be,</span> and he shall not rejoice
<span class="add">therein.
</span> <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C20V19">&nbsp;</a>Because he hath oppressed
<span class="add">and</span> hath forsaken the poor;
<span class="add">because</span> he hath violently taken away an house which he builded not;
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C20V20">&nbsp;</a>Surely he shall not feel quietness in his belly, he shall not save of that which he desired.
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C20V21">&nbsp;</a>There shall none of his meat be left; therefore shall no man look for his goods.
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C20V22">&nbsp;</a>In the fulness of his sufficiency he shall be in straits: every hand of the wicked shall come upon him.
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C20V23">&nbsp;</a><span class="add">When</span> he is about to fill his belly,
<span class="add">God</span> shall cast the fury of his wrath upon him, and shall rain
<span class="add">it</span> upon him while he is eating.
 <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C20V24">&nbsp;</a>He shall flee from the iron weapon,
<span class="add">and</span> the bow of steel shall strike him through.
 <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C20V25">&nbsp;</a>It is drawn, and cometh out of the body; yea, the glittering sword cometh out of his gall: terrors
<span class="add">are</span> upon him.
 <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C20V26">&nbsp;</a>All darkness
<span class="add">shall be</span> hid in his secret places: a fire not blown shall consume him; it shall go ill with him that is left
in his tabernacle.
 <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C20V27">&nbsp;</a>The heaven shall reveal his iniquity; and the earth shall rise up against him.
 <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C20V28">&nbsp;</a>The increase of his house shall depart,
<span class="add">and his goods</span> shall flow away in the day of his wrath.
 <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C20V29">&nbsp;</a>This
<span class="add">is</span> the portion of a wicked man from God, and the heritage appointed unto him by God.
