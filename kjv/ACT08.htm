 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C8V1">&nbsp;</a>And Saul was consenting unto his death. And at that time there was a great persecution against the church
which was at Jerusalem; and they were all scattered abroad throughout the regions of Judaea and Samaria,
except the apostles.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C8V2">&nbsp;</a>And devout men carried Stephen
<span class="add">to his burial,</span> and made great lamentation over him.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C8V3">&nbsp;</a>As for Saul, he made havock of the church, entering into every house, and haling men and women committed
<span class="add">them</span> to prison.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C8V4">&nbsp;</a>Therefore they that were scattered abroad went every where preaching the word.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C8V5">&nbsp;</a>Then Philip went down to the city of Samaria, and preached Christ unto them.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C8V6">&nbsp;</a>And the people with one accord gave heed unto those things which Philip spake, hearing and seeing the
miracles which he did.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C8V7">&nbsp;</a>For unclean spirits, crying with loud voice, came out of many that were possessed
<span class="add">with them:</span> and many taken with palsies, and that were lame, were healed.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C8V8">&nbsp;</a>And there was great joy in that city.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C8V9">&nbsp;</a>But there was a certain man, called Simon, which beforetime in the same city used sorcery, and bewitched
the people of Samaria, giving out that himself was some great one:
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C8V10">&nbsp;</a>To whom they all gave heed, from the least to the greatest, saying, This man is the great power of God.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C8V11">&nbsp;</a>And to him they had regard, because that of long time he had bewitched them with sorceries.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C8V12">&nbsp;</a>But when they believed Philip preaching the things concerning the kingdom of God, and the name of Jesus
Christ, they were baptized, both men and women.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C8V13">&nbsp;</a>Then Simon himself believed also: and when he was baptized, he continued with Philip, and wondered, beholding
the miracles and signs which were done.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C8V14">&nbsp;</a>Now when the apostles which were at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent
unto them Peter and John:
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C8V15">&nbsp;</a>Who, when they were come down, prayed for them, that they might receive the Holy Ghost:
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C8V16">&nbsp;</a>(For as yet he was fallen upon none of them: only they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.)
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C8V17">&nbsp;</a>Then laid they
<span class="add">their</span> hands on them, and they received the Holy Ghost.
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C8V18">&nbsp;</a>And when Simon saw that through laying on of the apostles’ hands the Holy Ghost was given, he offered
them money,
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C8V19">&nbsp;</a>Saying, Give me also this power, that on whomsoever I lay hands, he may receive the Holy Ghost.
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C8V20">&nbsp;</a>But Peter said unto him, Thy money perish with thee, because thou hast thought that the gift of God may
be purchased with money.
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C8V21">&nbsp;</a>Thou hast neither part nor lot in this matter: for thy heart is not right in the sight of God.
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C8V22">&nbsp;</a>Repent therefore of this thy wickedness, and pray God, if perhaps the thought of thine heart may be forgiven
thee.
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C8V23">&nbsp;</a>For I perceive that thou art in the gall of bitterness, and
<span class="add">in</span> the bond of iniquity.
 <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C8V24">&nbsp;</a>Then answered Simon, and said, Pray ye to the Lord for me, that none of these things which ye have spoken
come upon me.
 <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C8V25">&nbsp;</a>And they, when they had testified and preached the word of the Lord, returned to Jerusalem, and preached
the gospel in many villages of the Samaritans.
 <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C8V26">&nbsp;</a>And the angel of the Lord spake unto Philip, saying, Arise, and go toward the south unto the way that
goeth down from Jerusalem unto Gaza, which is desert.
 <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C8V27">&nbsp;</a>And he arose and went: and, behold, a man of Ethiopia, an eunuch of great authority under Candace queen
of the Ethiopians, who had the charge of all her treasure, and had come to Jerusalem for to worship,
 <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C8V28">&nbsp;</a>Was returning, and sitting in his chariot read Esaias the prophet.
 <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C8V29">&nbsp;</a>Then the Spirit said unto Philip, Go near, and join thyself to this chariot.
 <span class="verse"> 30</span><a name="C8V30">&nbsp;</a>And Philip ran thither to
<span class="add">him,</span> and heard him read the prophet Esaias, and said, Understandest thou what thou readest?
 <span class="verse"> 31</span><a name="C8V31">&nbsp;</a>And he said, How can I, except some man should guide me? And he desired Philip that he would come up
and sit with him.
 <span class="verse"> 32</span><a name="C8V32">&nbsp;</a>The place of the scripture which he read was this, He was led as a sheep to the slaughter; and like a
lamb dumb before his shearer, so opened he not his mouth:
 <span class="verse"> 33</span><a name="C8V33">&nbsp;</a>In his humiliation his judgment was taken away: and who shall declare his generation? for his life is
taken from the earth.
 <span class="verse"> 34</span><a name="C8V34">&nbsp;</a>And the eunuch answered Philip, and said, I pray thee, of whom speaketh the prophet this? of himself,
or of some other man?
 <span class="verse"> 35</span><a name="C8V35">&nbsp;</a>Then Philip opened his mouth, and began at the same scripture, and preached unto him Jesus.
 <span class="verse"> 36</span><a name="C8V36">&nbsp;</a>And as they went on
<span class="add">their</span> way, they came unto a certain water: and the eunuch said, See,
<span class="add">here is</span> water; what doth hinder me to be baptized?
 <span class="verse"> 37</span><a name="C8V37">&nbsp;</a>And Philip said, If thou believest with all thine heart, thou mayest. And he answered and said, I believe
that Jesus Christ is the Son of God.
 <span class="verse"> 38</span><a name="C8V38">&nbsp;</a>And he commanded the chariot to stand still: and they went down both into the water, both Philip and
the eunuch; and he baptized him.
 <span class="verse"> 39</span><a name="C8V39">&nbsp;</a>And when they were come up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord caught away Philip, that the eunuch
saw him no more: and he went on his way rejoicing.
 <span class="verse"> 40</span><a name="C8V40">&nbsp;</a>But Philip was found at Azotus: and passing through he preached in all the cities, till he came to Caesarea.
