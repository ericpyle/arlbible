 <span class="verse" id="V1">1&nbsp;</span>The wicked flee when no man pursueth: but the righteous are bold as a lion.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span>For the transgression of a land many <span class='add'>are</span> the princes thereof: but by a man of understanding <span class='add'>and</span> knowledge the state <span class='add'>thereof</span> shall be prolonged.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>A poor man that oppresseth the poor <span class='add'>is like</span> a sweeping rain which leaveth no food.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>They that forsake the law praise the wicked: but such as keep the law contend with them.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>Evil men understand not judgment: but they that seek the LORD understand all <span class='add'>things</span>.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>Better <span class='add'>is</span> the poor that walketh in his uprightness, than <span class='add'>he that is</span> perverse <span class='add'>in his</span> ways, though he <span class='add'>be</span> rich.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>Whoso keepeth the law <span class='add'>is</span> a wise son: but he that is a companion of riotous <span class='add'>men</span> shameth his father.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>He that by usury and unjust gain increaseth his substance, he shall gather it for him that will pity the poor.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>He that turneth away his ear from hearing the law, even his prayer <span class='add'>shall be</span> abomination.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>Whoso causeth the righteous to go astray in an evil way, he shall fall himself into his own pit: but the upright shall have good <span class='add'>things</span> in possession.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>The rich man <span class='add'>is</span> wise in his own conceit; but the poor that hath understanding searcheth him out.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>When righteous <span class='add'>men</span> do rejoice, <span class='add'>there is</span> great glory: but when the wicked rise, a man is hidden.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>He that covereth his sins shall not prosper: but whoso confesseth and forsaketh <span class='add'>them</span> shall have mercy.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>Happy <span class='add'>is</span> the man that feareth alway: but he that hardeneth his heart shall fall into mischief.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span> <span class='add'>As</span> a roaring lion, and a ranging bear; <span class='add'>so is</span> a wicked ruler over the poor people.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>The prince that wanteth understanding <span class='add'>is</span> also a great oppressor: <span class='add'>but</span> he that hateth covetousness shall prolong <span class='add'>his</span> days.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>A man that doeth violence to the blood of <span class='add'>any</span> person shall flee to the pit; let no man stay him.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>Whoso walketh uprightly shall be saved: but <span class='add'>he that is</span> perverse <span class='add'>in his</span> ways shall fall at once.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>He that tilleth his land shall have plenty of bread: but he that followeth after vain <span class='add'>persons</span> shall have poverty enough.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>A faithful man shall abound with blessings: but he that maketh haste to be rich shall not be innocent.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>To have respect of persons <span class='add'>is</span> not good: for for a piece of bread <span class='add'>that</span> man will transgress.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>He that hasteth to be rich <span class='add'>hath</span> an evil eye, and considereth not that poverty shall come upon him.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>He that rebuketh a man afterwards shall find more favour than he that flattereth with the tongue.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>Whoso robbeth his father or his mother, and saith, <span class='add'>It is</span> no transgression; the same <span class='add'>is</span> the companion of a destroyer.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>He that is of a proud heart stirreth up strife: but he that putteth his trust in the LORD shall be made fat.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>He that trusteth in his own heart is a fool: but whoso walketh wisely, he shall be delivered.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>He that giveth unto the poor shall not lack: but he that hideth his eyes shall have many a curse.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&nbsp;</span>When the wicked rise, men hide themselves: but when they perish, the righteous increase. </div><ul class='tnav'>
