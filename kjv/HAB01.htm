 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C1V1">&nbsp;</a>The burden which Habakkuk the prophet did see.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C1V2">&nbsp;</a>O LORD, how long shall I cry, and thou wilt not hear!
<span class="add">even</span> cry out unto thee
<span class="add">of</span> violence, and thou wilt not save!
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C1V3">&nbsp;</a>Why dost thou shew me iniquity, and cause
<span class="add">me</span> to behold grievance? for spoiling and violence
<span class="add">are</span> before me: and there are
<span class="add">that</span> raise up strife and contention.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C1V4">&nbsp;</a>Therefore the law is slacked, and judgment doth never go forth: for the wicked doth compass about the
righteous; therefore wrong judgment proceedeth.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C1V5">&nbsp;</a>Behold ye among the heathen, and regard, and wonder marvellously: for
<span class="add">I</span> will work a work in your days,
<span class="add">which</span> ye will not believe, though it be told
<span class="add">you.
</span> <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C1V6">&nbsp;</a>For, lo, I raise up the Chaldeans,
<span class="add">that</span> bitter and hasty nation, which shall march through the breadth of the land, to possess the dwellingplaces
<span class="add">that are</span> not theirs.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C1V7">&nbsp;</a>They
<span class="add">are</span> terrible and dreadful: their judgment and their dignity shall proceed of themselves.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C1V8">&nbsp;</a>Their horses also are swifter than the leopards, and are more fierce than the evening wolves: and their
horsemen shall spread themselves, and their horsemen shall come from far; they shall fly as the eagle
<span class="add">that</span> hasteth to eat.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C1V9">&nbsp;</a>They shall come all for violence: their faces shall sup up
<span class="add">as</span> the east wind, and they shall gather the captivity as the sand.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C1V10">&nbsp;</a>And they shall scoff at the kings, and the princes shall be a scorn unto them: they shall deride every
strong hold; for they shall heap dust, and take it.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C1V11">&nbsp;</a>Then shall
<span class="add">his</span> mind change, and he shall pass over, and offend,
<span class="add">imputing</span> this his power unto his god.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C1V12">&nbsp;</a><span class="add">Art</span> thou not from everlasting, O LORD my God, mine Holy One? we shall not die. O LORD, thou hast ordained
them for judgment; and, O mighty God, thou hast established them for correction.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C1V13">&nbsp;</a><span class="add">Thou art</span> of purer eyes than to behold evil, and canst not look on iniquity: wherefore lookest thou upon them
that deal treacherously,
<span class="add">and</span> holdest thy tongue when the wicked devoureth
<span class="add">the man that is</span> more righteous than he?
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C1V14">&nbsp;</a>And makest men as the fishes of the sea, as the creeping things,
<span class="add">that have</span> no ruler over them?
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C1V15">&nbsp;</a>They take up all of them with the angle, they catch them in their net, and gather them in their drag:
therefore they rejoice and are glad.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C1V16">&nbsp;</a>Therefore they sacrifice unto their net, and burn incense unto their drag; because by them their portion
<span class="add">is</span> fat, and their meat plenteous.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C1V17">&nbsp;</a>Shall they therefore empty their net, and not spare continually to slay the nations?
