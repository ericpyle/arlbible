O LORD, thou hast ordained them for judgment; and, O mighty God, thou hast established them for correction.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span> <span class='add'>Thou art</span> of purer eyes than to behold evil, and canst not look on iniquity: wherefore lookest thou upon them that deal treacherously, <span class='add'>and</span> holdest thy tongue when the wicked devoureth <span class='add'>the man that is</span> more righteous than he?  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>And makest men as the fishes of the sea, as the creeping things, <span class='add'>that have</span> no ruler over them?  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>They take up all of them with the angle, they catch them in their net, and gather them in their drag: therefore they rejoice and are glad.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>Therefore they sacrifice unto their net, and burn incense unto their drag; because by them their portion <span class='add'>is</span> fat, and their meat plenteous.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>Shall they therefore empty their net, and not spare continually to slay the nations? </div><ul class='tnav'>
