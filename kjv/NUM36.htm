 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C36V1">&nbsp;</a>And the chief fathers of the families of the children of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh,
of the families of the sons of Joseph, came near, and spake before Moses, and before the princes, the
chief fathers of the children of Israel:
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C36V2">&nbsp;</a>And they said, The LORD commanded my lord to give the land for an inheritance by lot to the children
of Israel: and my lord was commanded by the LORD to give the inheritance of Zelophehad our brother unto
his daughters.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C36V3">&nbsp;</a>And if they be married to any of the sons of the
<span class="add">other</span> tribes of the children of Israel, then shall their inheritance be taken from the inheritance of our
fathers, and shall be put to the inheritance of the tribe whereunto they are received: so shall it be
taken from the lot of our inheritance.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C36V4">&nbsp;</a>And when the jubile of the children of Israel shall be, then shall their inheritance be put unto the
inheritance of the tribe whereunto they are received: so shall their inheritance be taken away from the
inheritance of the tribe of our fathers.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C36V5">&nbsp;</a>And Moses commanded the children of Israel according to the word of the LORD, saying, The tribe of the
sons of Joseph hath said well.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C36V6">&nbsp;</a>This is the thing which the LORD doth command concerning the daughters of Zelophehad, saying, Let them
marry to whom they think best; only to the family of the tribe of their father shall they marry.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C36V7">&nbsp;</a>So shall not the inheritance of the children of Israel remove from tribe to tribe: for every one of the
children of Israel shall keep himself to the inheritance of the tribe of his fathers.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C36V8">&nbsp;</a>And every daughter, that possesseth an inheritance in any tribe of the children of Israel, shall be wife
unto one of the family of the tribe of her father, that the children of Israel may enjoy every man the
inheritance of his fathers.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C36V9">&nbsp;</a>Neither shall the inheritance remove from
<span class="add">one</span> tribe to another tribe; but every one of the tribes of the children of Israel shall keep himself to
his own inheritance.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C36V10">&nbsp;</a>Even as the LORD commanded Moses, so did the daughters of Zelophehad:
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C36V11">&nbsp;</a>For Mahlah, Tirzah, and Hoglah, and Milcah, and Noah, the daughters of Zelophehad, were married unto
their father’s brothers’ sons:
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C36V12">&nbsp;</a><span class="add">And</span> they were married into the families of the sons of Manasseh the son of Joseph, and their inheritance
remained in the tribe of the family of their father.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C36V13">&nbsp;</a>These
<span class="add">are</span> the commandments and the judgments, which the LORD commanded by the hand of Moses unto the children
of Israel in the plains of Moab by Jordan
<span class="add">near</span> Jericho.
