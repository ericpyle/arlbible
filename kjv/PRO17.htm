 <span class="verse" id="V1">1&nbsp;</span>Better <span class='add'>is</span> a dry morsel, and quietness therewith, than an house full of sacrifices <span class='add'>with</span> strife.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span>A wise servant shall have rule over a son that causeth shame, and shall have part of the inheritance among the brethren.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>The fining pot <span class='add'>is</span> for silver, and the furnace for gold: but the LORD trieth the hearts.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>A wicked doer giveth heed to false lips; <span class='add'>and</span> a liar giveth ear to a naughty tongue.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>Whoso mocketh the poor reproacheth his Maker: <span class='add'>and</span> he that is glad at calamities shall not be unpunished.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>Children’s children <span class='add'>are</span> the crown of old men; and the glory of children <span class='add'>are</span> their fathers.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>Excellent speech becometh not a fool: much less do lying lips a prince.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>A gift <span class='add'>is as</span> a precious stone in the eyes of him that hath it: whithersoever it turneth, it prospereth.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>He that covereth a transgression seeketh love; but he that repeateth a matter separateth <span class='add'>very</span> friends.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>A reproof entereth more into a wise man than an hundred stripes into a fool.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>An evil <span class='add'>man</span> seeketh only rebellion: therefore a cruel messenger shall be sent against him.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>Let a bear robbed of her whelps meet a man, rather than a fool in his folly.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>Whoso rewardeth evil for good, evil shall not depart from his house.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>The beginning of strife <span class='add'>is as</span> when one letteth out water: therefore leave off contention, before it be meddled with.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>He that justifieth the wicked, and he that condemneth the just, even they both <span class='add'>are</span> abomination to the LORD.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>Wherefore <span class='add'>is there</span> a price in the hand of a fool to get wisdom, seeing <span class='add'>he hath</span> no heart <span class='add'>to it?</span>  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>A friend loveth at all times, and a brother is born for adversity.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>A man void of understanding striketh hands, <span class='add'>and</span> becometh surety in the presence of his friend.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>He loveth transgression that loveth strife: <span class='add'>and</span> he that exalteth his gate seeketh destruction.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>He that hath a froward heart findeth no good: and he that hath a perverse tongue falleth into mischief.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>He that begetteth a fool <span class='add'>doeth it</span> to his sorrow: and the father of a fool hath no joy.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>A merry heart doeth good <span class='add'>like</span> a medicine: but a broken spirit drieth the bones.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>A wicked <span class='add'>man</span> taketh a gift out of the bosom to pervert the ways of judgment.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>Wisdom <span class='add'>is</span> before him that hath understanding; but the eyes of a fool <span class='add'>are</span> in the ends of the earth.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>A foolish son <span class='add'>is</span> a grief to his father, and bitterness to her that bare him.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>Also to punish the just <span class='add'>is</span> not good, <span class='add'>nor</span> to strike princes for equity.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>He that hath knowledge spareth his words: <span class='add'>and</span> a man of understanding is of an excellent spirit.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&nbsp;</span>Even a fool, when he holdeth his peace, is counted wise: <span class='add'>and</span> he that shutteth his lips <span class='add'>is esteemed</span> a man of understanding. </div><ul class='tnav'>
