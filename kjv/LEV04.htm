then let him bring for his sin, which he hath sinned, a young bullock without blemish unto the LORD for a sin offering.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>And he shall bring the bullock unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation before the LORD; and shall lay his hand upon the bullock’s head, and kill the bullock before the LORD.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>And the priest that is anointed shall take of the bullock’s blood, and bring it to the tabernacle of the congregation:  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>And the priest shall dip his finger in the blood, and sprinkle of the blood seven times before the LORD, before the vail of the sanctuary.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>And the priest shall put <span class='add'>some</span> of the blood upon the horns of the altar of sweet incense before the LORD, which <span class='add'>is</span> in the tabernacle of the congregation;
