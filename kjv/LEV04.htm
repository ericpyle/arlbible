 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C4V1">&nbsp;</a>And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C4V2">&nbsp;</a>Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, If a soul shall sin through ignorance against any of the commandments
of the LORD
<span class="add">concerning things</span> which ought not to be done, and shall do against any of them:
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C4V3">&nbsp;</a>If the priest that is anointed do sin according to the sin of the people; then let him bring for his
sin, which he hath sinned, a young bullock without blemish unto the LORD for a sin offering.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C4V4">&nbsp;</a>And he shall bring the bullock unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation before the LORD; and
shall lay his hand upon the bullock’s head, and kill the bullock before the LORD.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C4V5">&nbsp;</a>And the priest that is anointed shall take of the bullock’s blood, and bring it to the tabernacle of
the congregation:
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C4V6">&nbsp;</a>And the priest shall dip his finger in the blood, and sprinkle of the blood seven times before the LORD,
before the vail of the sanctuary.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C4V7">&nbsp;</a>And the priest shall put
<span class="add">some</span> of the blood upon the horns of the altar of sweet incense before the LORD, which
<span class="add">is</span> in the tabernacle of the congregation: and shall pour all the blood of the bullock at the bottom of
the altar of the burnt offering, which
<span class="add">is at</span> the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C4V8">&nbsp;</a>And he shall take off from it all the fat of the bullock for the sin offering; the fat that covereth
the inwards, and all the fat that
<span class="add">is</span> upon the inwards,
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C4V9">&nbsp;</a>And the two kidneys, and the fat that
<span class="add">is</span> upon them, which
<span class="add">is</span> by the flanks, and the caul above the liver, with the kidneys, it shall he take away,
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C4V10">&nbsp;</a>As it was taken off from the bullock of the sacrifice of peace offerings: and the priest shall burn them
upon the altar of the burnt offering.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C4V11">&nbsp;</a>And the skin of the bullock, and all his flesh, with his head, and with his legs, and his inwards, and
his dung,
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C4V12">&nbsp;</a>Even the whole bullock shall he carry forth without the camp unto a clean place, where the ashes are
poured out, and burn him on the wood with fire: where the ashes are poured out shall he be burnt.

<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C4V13">&nbsp;</a>And if the whole congregation of Israel sin through ignorance, and the thing be hid from the eyes of
the assembly, and they have done
<span class="add">somewhat against</span> any of the commandments of the LORD
<span class="add">concerning things</span> which should not be done, and are guilty;
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C4V14">&nbsp;</a>When the sin, which they have sinned against it, is known, then the congregation shall offer a young
bullock for the sin, and bring him before the tabernacle of the congregation.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C4V15">&nbsp;</a>And the elders of the congregation shall lay their hands upon the head of the bullock before the LORD:
and the bullock shall be killed before the LORD.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C4V16">&nbsp;</a>And the priest that is anointed shall bring of the bullock’s blood to the tabernacle of the congregation:
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C4V17">&nbsp;</a>And the priest shall dip his finger
<span class="add">in some</span> of the blood, and sprinkle
<span class="add">it</span> seven times before the LORD,
<span class="add">even</span> before the vail.
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C4V18">&nbsp;</a>And he shall put
<span class="add">some</span> of the blood upon the horns of the altar which
<span class="add">is</span> before the LORD, that
<span class="add">is</span> in the tabernacle of the congregation, and shall pour out all the blood at the bottom of the altar of
the burnt offering, which
<span class="add">is at</span> the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C4V19">&nbsp;</a>And he shall take all his fat from him, and burn
<span class="add">it</span> upon the altar.
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C4V20">&nbsp;</a>And he shall do with the bullock as he did with the bullock for a sin offering, so shall he do with this:
and the priest shall make an atonement for them, and it shall be forgiven them.
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C4V21">&nbsp;</a>And he shall carry forth the bullock without the camp, and burn him as he burned the first bullock: it
<span class="add">is</span> a sin offering for the congregation.
