 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C22V1">&nbsp;</a>Thou shalt not see the brother’s ox or his sheep go astray, and hide thyself from them: thou shalt in
any case bring them again unto thy brother.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C22V2">&nbsp;</a>And if thy brother
<span class="add">be</span> not nigh unto thee, or if thou know him not, then thou shalt bring it unto thine own house, and it shall
be with thee until thy brother seek after it, and thou shalt restore it to him again.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C22V3">&nbsp;</a>In like manner shalt thou do with his ass; and so shalt thou do with his raiment; and with all lost things
of thy brother’s, which he hath lost, and thou hast found, shalt thou do likewise: thou mayest not hide
thyself.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C22V4">&nbsp;</a>Thou shalt not see thy brother’s ass or his ox fall down by the way, and hide thyself from them: thou
shalt surely help him to lift
<span class="add">them</span> up again.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C22V5">&nbsp;</a>The woman shall not wear that which pertaineth unto a man, neither shall a man put on a woman’s garment:
for all that do so
<span class="add">are</span> abomination unto the LORD thy God.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C22V6">&nbsp;</a>If a bird’s nest chance to be before thee in the way in any tree, or on the ground,
<span class="add">whether they be</span> young ones, or eggs, and the dam sitting upon the young, or upon the eggs, thou shalt not take the dam
with the young:
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C22V7">&nbsp;</a><span class="add">But</span> thou shalt in any wise let the dam go, and take the young to thee; that it may be well with thee, and
<span class="add">that</span> thou mayest prolong
<span class="add">thy</span> days.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C22V8">&nbsp;</a>When thou buildest a new house, then thou shalt make a battlement for thy roof, that thou bring not blood
upon thine house, if any man fall from thence.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C22V9">&nbsp;</a>Thou shalt not sow thy vineyard with divers seeds: lest the fruit of thy seed which thou hast sown, and
the fruit of thy vineyard, be defiled.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C22V10">&nbsp;</a>Thou shalt not plow with an ox and an ass together.

 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C22V14">&nbsp;</a>And give occasions of speech against her, and bring up an evil name upon her, and say, I took this woman,
and when I came to her, I found her not a maid:
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C22V15">&nbsp;</a>Then shall the father of the damsel, and her mother, take and bring forth
<span class="add">the tokens of</span> the damsel’s virginity unto the elders of the city in the gate:
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C22V16">&nbsp;</a>And the damsel’s father shall say unto the elders, I gave my daughter unto this man to wife, and he hateth
her;
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C22V17">&nbsp;</a>And, lo, he hath given occasions of speech
<span class="add">against her,</span> saying, I found not thy daughter a maid; and yet these
<span class="add">are the tokens of</span> my daughter’s virginity. And they shall spread the cloth before the elders of the city.
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C22V18">&nbsp;</a>And the elders of that city shall take that man and chastise him;
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C22V19">&nbsp;</a>And they shall amerce him in an hundred
<span class="add">shekels</span> of silver, and give
<span class="add">them</span> unto the father of the damsel, because he hath brought up an evil name upon a virgin of Israel: and
she shall be his wife; he may not put her away all his days.
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C22V20">&nbsp;</a>But if this thing be true,
<span class="add">and the tokens of</span> virginity be not found for the damsel:
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C22V21">&nbsp;</a>Then they shall bring out the damsel to the door of her father’s house, and the men of her city shall
stone her with stones that she die: because she hath wrought folly in Israel, to play the whore in her
father’s house: so shalt thou put evil away from among you.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C22V22">&nbsp;</a>If a man be found lying with a woman married to an husband, then they shall both of them die,
<span class="add">both</span> the man that lay with the woman, and the woman: so shalt thou put away evil from Israel.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C22V23">&nbsp;</a>If a damsel
<span class="add">that is</span> a virgin be betrothed unto an husband, and a man find her in the city, and lie with her;
 <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C22V24">&nbsp;</a>Then ye shall bring them both out unto the gate of that city, and ye shall stone them with stones that
they die; the damsel, because she cried not,
<span class="add">being</span> in the city; and the man, because he hath humbled his neighbour’s wife: so thou shalt put away evil
from among you.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C22V25">&nbsp;</a>But if a man find a betrothed damsel in the field, and the man force her, and lie with her: then the
man only that lay with her shall die:
 <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C22V26">&nbsp;</a>But unto the damsel thou shalt do nothing;
<span class="add">there is</span> in the damsel no sin
<span class="add">worthy</span> of death: for as when a man riseth against his neighbour, and slayeth him, even so
<span class="add">is</span> this matter:
 <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C22V27">&nbsp;</a>For he found her in the field,
<span class="add">and</span> the betrothed damsel cried, and
<span class="add">there was</span> none to save her.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C22V28">&nbsp;</a>If a man find a damsel
<span class="add">that is</span> a virgin, which is not betrothed, and lay hold on her, and lie with her, and they be found;
 <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C22V29">&nbsp;</a>Then the man that lay with her shall give unto the damsel’s father fifty
<span class="add">shekels</span> of silver, and she shall be his wife; because he hath humbled her, he may not put her away all his days.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 30</span><a name="C22V30">&nbsp;</a>A man shall not take his father’s wife, nor discover his father’s skirt.
