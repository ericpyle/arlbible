 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C12V1">&nbsp;</a>And the LORD spake unto Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt, saying,
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C12V2">&nbsp;</a>This month
<span class="add">shall be</span> unto you the beginning of months: it
<span class="add">shall be</span> the first month of the year to you.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C12V3">&nbsp;</a>Speak ye unto all the congregation of Israel, saying, In the tenth
<span class="add">day</span> of this month they shall take to them every man a lamb, according to the house of
<span class="add">their</span> fathers, a lamb for an house:
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C12V4">&nbsp;</a>And if the household be too little for the lamb, let him and his neighbour next unto his house take
<span class="add">it</span> according to the number of the souls; every man according to his eating shall make your count for the
lamb.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C12V5">&nbsp;</a>Your lamb shall be without blemish, a male of the first year: ye shall take
<span class="add">it</span> out from the sheep, or from the goats:
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C12V6">&nbsp;</a>And ye shall keep it up until the fourteenth day of the same month: and the whole assembly of the congregation
of Israel shall kill it in the evening.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C12V7">&nbsp;</a>And they shall take of the blood, and strike
<span class="add">it</span> on the two side posts and on the upper door post of the houses, wherein they shall eat it.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C12V8">&nbsp;</a>And they shall eat the flesh in that night, roast with fire, and unleavened bread;
<span class="add">and</span> with bitter
<span class="add">herbs</span> they shall eat it.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C12V9">&nbsp;</a>Eat not of it raw, nor sodden at all with water, but roast
<span class="add">with
</span> fire; his head with his legs, and with the purtenance thereof.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C12V10">&nbsp;</a>And ye shall let nothing of it remain until the morning; and that which remaineth of it until the morning
ye shall burn with fire.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C12V11">&nbsp;</a>And thus shall ye eat it;
<span class="add">with</span> your loins girded, your shoes on your feet, and your staff in your hand; and ye shall eat it in haste:
it
<span class="add">is</span> the LORD’S passover.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C12V12">&nbsp;</a>For I will pass through the land of Egypt this night, and will smite all the firstborn in the land of
Egypt, both man and beast; and against all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgment: I
<span class="add">am</span> the LORD.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C12V13">&nbsp;</a>And the blood shall be to you for a token upon the houses where ye
<span class="add">are:</span> and when I see the blood, I will pass over you, and the plague shall not be upon you to destroy
<span class="add">you,</span> when I smite the land of Egypt.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C12V14">&nbsp;</a>And this day shall be unto you for a memorial; and ye shall keep it a feast to the LORD throughout your
generations; ye shall keep it a feast by an ordinance for ever.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C12V15">&nbsp;</a>Seven days shall ye eat unleavened bread; even the first day ye shall put away leaven out of your houses:
for whosoever eateth leavened bread from the first day until the seventh day, that soul shall be cut
off from Israel.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C12V16">&nbsp;</a>And in the first day
<span class="add">there shall be</span> an holy convocation, and in the seventh day there shall be an holy convocation to you; no manner of
work shall be done in them, save
<span class="add">that</span> which every man must eat, that only may be done of you.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C12V17">&nbsp;</a>And ye shall observe
<span class="add">the feast of</span> unleavened bread; for in this selfsame day have I brought your armies out of the land of Egypt: therefore
shall ye observe this day in your generations by an ordinance for ever.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C12V18">&nbsp;</a>In the first
<span class="add">month,</span> on the fourteenth day of the month at even, ye shall eat unleavened bread, until the one and twentieth
day of the month at even.
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C12V19">&nbsp;</a>Seven days shall there be no leaven found in your houses: for whosoever eateth that which is leavened,
even that soul shall be cut off from the congregation of Israel, whether he be a stranger, or born in
the land.
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C12V20">&nbsp;</a>Ye shall eat nothing leavened; in all your habitations shall ye eat unleavened bread.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C12V21">&nbsp;</a>Then Moses called for all the elders of Israel, and said unto them, Draw out and take you a lamb according
to your families, and kill the passover.
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C12V22">&nbsp;</a>And ye shall take a bunch of hyssop, and dip
<span class="add">it</span> in the blood that
<span class="add">is</span> in the bason, and strike the lintel and the two side posts with the blood that
<span class="add">is</span> in the bason; and none of you shall go out at the door of his house until the morning.
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C12V23">&nbsp;</a>For the LORD will pass through to smite the Egyptians; and when he seeth the blood upon the lintel, and
on the two side posts, the LORD will pass over the door, and will not suffer the destroyer to come in
unto your houses to smite
<span class="add">you.
</span> <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C12V24">&nbsp;</a>And ye shall observe this thing for an ordinance to thee and to thy sons for ever.
 <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C12V25">&nbsp;</a>And it shall come to pass, when ye be come to the land which the LORD will give you, according as he
hath promised, that ye shall keep this service.
 <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C12V26">&nbsp;</a>And it shall come to pass, when your children shall say unto you, What mean ye by this service?
 <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C12V27">&nbsp;</a>That ye shall say, It
<span class="add">is</span> the sacrifice of the LORD’S passover, who passed over the houses of the children of Israel in Egypt,
when he smote the Egyptians, and delivered our houses. And the people bowed the head and worshipped.
 <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C12V28">&nbsp;</a>And the children of Israel went away, and did as the LORD had commanded Moses and Aaron, so did they.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C12V29">&nbsp;</a>And it came to pass, that at midnight the LORD smote all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, from the
firstborn of Pharaoh that sat on his throne unto the firstborn of the captive that
<span class="add">was</span> in the dungeon; and all the firstborn of cattle.
 <span class="verse"> 30</span><a name="C12V30">&nbsp;</a>And Pharaoh rose up in the night, he, and all his servants, and all the Egyptians; and there was a great
cry in Egypt; for
<span class="add">there was</span> not a house where
<span class="add">there was</span> not one dead.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 31</span><a name="C12V31">&nbsp;</a>And he called for Moses and Aaron by night, and said, Rise up,
<span class="add">and</span> get you forth from among my people, both ye and the children of Israel; and go, serve the LORD, as ye
have said.
 <span class="verse"> 32</span><a name="C12V32">&nbsp;</a>Also take your flocks and your herds, as ye have said, and be gone; and bless me also.
 <span class="verse"> 33</span><a name="C12V33">&nbsp;</a>And the Egyptians were urgent upon the people, that they might send them out of the land in haste; for
they said, We
<span class="add">be</span> all dead
<span class="add">men.
</span> <span class="verse"> 34</span><a name="C12V34">&nbsp;</a>And the people took their dough before it was leavened, their kneadingtroughs being bound up in their
clothes upon their shoulders.
 <span class="verse"> 35</span><a name="C12V35">&nbsp;</a>And the children of Israel did according to the word of Moses; and they borrowed of the Egyptians jewels
of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment:
 <span class="verse"> 36</span><a name="C12V36">&nbsp;</a>And the LORD gave the people favour in the sight of the Egyptians, so that they lent unto them
<span class="add">such things as they required.</span> And they spoiled the Egyptians.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 37</span><a name="C12V37">&nbsp;</a>And the children of Israel journeyed from Rameses to Succoth, about six hundred thousand on foot
<span class="add">that were</span> men, beside children.
 <span class="verse"> 38</span><a name="C12V38">&nbsp;</a>And a mixed multitude went up also with them; and flocks, and herds,
<span class="add">even</span> very much cattle.
 <span class="verse"> 39</span><a name="C12V39">&nbsp;</a>And they baked unleavened cakes of the dough which they brought forth out of Egypt, for it was not leavened;
because they were thrust out of Egypt, and could not tarry, neither had they prepared for themselves
any victual.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 40</span><a name="C12V40">&nbsp;</a>Now the sojourning of the children of Israel, who dwelt in Egypt,
<span class="add">was</span> four hundred and thirty years.
 <span class="verse"> 41</span><a name="C12V41">&nbsp;</a>And it came to pass at the end of the four hundred and thirty years, even the selfsame day it came to
pass, that all the hosts of the LORD went out from the land of Egypt.
 <span class="verse"> 42</span><a name="C12V42">&nbsp;</a>It
<span class="add">is</span> a night to be much observed unto the LORD for bringing them out from the land of Egypt: this
<span class="add">is</span> that night of the LORD to be observed of all the children of Israel in their generations.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 43</span><a name="C12V43">&nbsp;</a>And the LORD said unto Moses and Aaron, This
<span class="add">is</span> the ordinance of the passover: There shall no stranger eat thereof:
 <span class="verse"> 44</span><a name="C12V44">&nbsp;</a>But every man’s servant that is bought for money, when thou hast circumcised him, then shall he eat thereof.
 <span class="verse"> 45</span><a name="C12V45">&nbsp;</a>A foreigner and an hired servant shall not eat thereof.
 <span class="verse"> 46</span><a name="C12V46">&nbsp;</a>In one house shall it be eaten; thou shalt not carry forth ought of the flesh abroad out of the house;
neither shall ye break a bone thereof.
 <span class="verse"> 47</span><a name="C12V47">&nbsp;</a>All the congregation of Israel shall keep it.
 <span class="verse"> 48</span><a name="C12V48">&nbsp;</a>And when a stranger shall sojourn with thee, and will keep the passover to the LORD, let all his males
be circumcised, and then let him come near and keep it; and he shall be as one that is born in the land:
for no uncircumcised person shall eat thereof.
 <span class="verse"> 49</span><a name="C12V49">&nbsp;</a>One law shall be to him that is homeborn, and unto the stranger that sojourneth among you.
 <span class="verse"> 50</span><a name="C12V50">&nbsp;</a>Thus did all the children of Israel; as the LORD commanded Moses and Aaron, so did they.
 <span class="verse"> 51</span><a name="C12V51">&nbsp;</a>And it came to pass the selfsame day,
<span class="add">that</span> the LORD did bring the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt by their armies.
