 <span class="verse" id="V1">1&nbsp;</span>Then Job answered and said,  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span>I know <span class='add'>it is</span> so of a truth: but how should man be just with God?  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>If he will contend with him, he cannot answer him one of a thousand.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span> <span class='add'>He is</span> wise in heart, and mighty in strength: who hath hardened <span class='add'>himself</span> against him, and hath prospered?  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>Which removeth the mountains, and they know not: which overturneth them in his anger.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>Which shaketh the earth out of her place, and the pillars thereof tremble.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>Which commandeth the sun, and it riseth not; and sealeth up the stars.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>Which alone spreadeth out the heavens, and treadeth upon the waves of the sea.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>Which maketh Arcturus, Orion, and Pleiades, and the chambers of the south.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>Which doeth great things past finding out; yea, and wonders without number.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>Lo, he goeth by me, and I see <span class='add'>him</span> not: he passeth on also, but I perceive him not.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>Behold, he taketh away, who can hinder him? who will say unto him, What doest thou?  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span> <span class='add'>If</span> God will not withdraw his anger, the proud helpers do stoop under him.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>How much less shall I answer him, <span class='add'>and</span> choose out my words <span class='add'>to reason</span> with him?  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>Whom, though I were righteous, <span class='add'>yet</span> would I not answer, <span class='add'>but</span> I would make supplication to my judge.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>If I had called, and he had answered me; <span class='add'>yet</span> would I not believe that he had hearkened unto my voice.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>For he breaketh me with a tempest, and multiplieth my wounds without cause.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>He will not suffer me to take my breath, but filleth me with bitterness.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>If <span class='add'>I speak</span> of strength, lo, <span class='add'>he is</span> strong: and if of judgment, who shall set me a time <span class='add'>to plead?</span>  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>If I justify myself, mine own mouth shall condemn me: <span class='add'>if I say, I am</span> perfect, it shall also prove me perverse.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span> <span class='add'>Though</span> I <span class='add'>were</span> perfect, <span class='add'>yet</span> would I not know my soul: I would despise my life.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>This <span class='add'>is</span> one <span class='add'>thing</span>, therefore I said <span class='add'>it</span>, He destroyeth the perfect and the wicked.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>If the scourge slay suddenly, he will laugh at the trial of the innocent.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>The earth is given into the hand of the wicked: he covereth the faces of the judges thereof; if not, where, <span class='add'>and</span> who <span class='add'>is</span> he?  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>Now my days are swifter than a post: they flee away, they see no good.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>They are passed away as the swift ships: as the eagle <span class='add'>that</span> hasteth to the prey.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>If I say, I will forget my complaint, I will leave off my heaviness, and comfort <span class='add'>myself:</span>  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&nbsp;</span>I am afraid of all my sorrows, I know that thou wilt not hold me innocent.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&nbsp;</span> <span class='add'>If</span> I be wicked, why then labour I in vain?  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&nbsp;</span>If I wash myself with snow water, and make my hands never so clean;  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&nbsp;</span>Yet shalt thou plunge me in the ditch, and mine own clothes shall abhor me.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&nbsp;</span>For <span class='add'>he is</span> not a man, as I <span class='add'>am, that</span> I should answer him, <span class='add'>and</span> we should come together in judgment.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&nbsp;</span>Neither is there any daysman betwixt us, <span class='add'>that</span> might lay his hand upon us both.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&nbsp;</span>Let him take his rod away from me, and let not his fear terrify me:  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&nbsp;</span> <span class='add'>Then</span> would I speak, and not fear him; but <span class='add'>it is</span> not so with me. </div><ul class='tnav'>
