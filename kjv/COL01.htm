<div class="mt1">The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Colossians
</div>
<div class="chapterlabel"> 1</div><div class="p">
 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C1V1">&nbsp;</a>Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and Timotheus
<span class="add">our</span> brother,
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C1V2">&nbsp;</a>To the saints and faithful brethren in Christ which are at Colosse: Grace
<span class="add">be</span> unto you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C1V3">&nbsp;</a>We give thanks to God and the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, praying always for you,
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C1V4">&nbsp;</a>Since we heard of your faith in Christ Jesus, and of the love
<span class="add">which ye have</span> to all the saints,
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C1V5">&nbsp;</a>For the hope which is laid up for you in heaven, whereof ye heard before in the word of the truth of
the gospel;
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C1V6">&nbsp;</a>Which is come unto you, as
<span class="add">it is</span> in all the world; and bringeth forth fruit, as
<span class="add">it doth</span> also in you, since the day ye heard
<span class="add">of it,</span> and knew the grace of God in truth:
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C1V7">&nbsp;</a>As ye also learned of Epaphras our dear fellowservant, who is for you a faithful minister of Christ;
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C1V8">&nbsp;</a>Who also declared unto us your love in the Spirit.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C1V9">&nbsp;</a>For this cause we also, since the day we heard
<span class="add">it,</span> do not cease to pray for you, and to desire that ye might be filled with the knowledge of his will in
all wisdom and spiritual understanding;
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C1V10">&nbsp;</a>That ye might walk worthy of the Lord unto all pleasing, being fruitful in every good work, and increasing
in the knowledge of God;
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C1V11">&nbsp;</a>Strengthened with all might, according to his glorious power, unto all patience and longsuffering with
joyfulness;
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C1V12">&nbsp;</a>Giving thanks unto the Father, which hath made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints
in light:
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C1V13">&nbsp;</a>Who hath delivered us from the power of darkness, and hath translated
<span class="add">us</span> into the kingdom of his dear Son:
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C1V14">&nbsp;</a>In whom we have redemption through his blood,
<span class="add">even</span> the forgiveness of sins:
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C1V15">&nbsp;</a>Who is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of every creature:
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C1V16">&nbsp;</a>For by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible,
whether
<span class="add">they be</span> thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: all things were created by him, and for him:
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C1V17">&nbsp;</a>And he is before all things, and by him all things consist.
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C1V18">&nbsp;</a>And he is the head of the body, the church: who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead; that in
all
<span class="add">things</span> he might have the preeminence.
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C1V19">&nbsp;</a>For it pleased
<span class="add">the Father</span> that in him should all fulness dwell;
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C1V20">&nbsp;</a>And, having made peace through the blood of his cross, by him to reconcile all things unto himself; by
him,
<span class="add">I say,</span> whether
<span class="add">they be</span> things in earth, or things in heaven.
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C1V21">&nbsp;</a>And you, that were sometime alienated and enemies in
<span class="add">your
</span> mind by wicked works, yet now hath he reconciled
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C1V22">&nbsp;</a>In the body of his flesh through death, to present you holy and unblameable and unreproveable in his
sight:
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C1V23">&nbsp;</a>If ye continue in the faith grounded and settled, and
<span class="add">be
</span> not moved away from the hope of the gospel, which ye have heard,
<span class="add">and</span> which was preached to every creature which is under heaven; whereof I Paul am made a minister;
 <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C1V24">&nbsp;</a>Who now rejoice in my sufferings for you, and fill up that which is behind of the afflictions of Christ
in my flesh for his body’s sake, which is the church:
 <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C1V25">&nbsp;</a>Whereof I am made a minister, according to the dispensation of God which is given to me for you, to fulfil
the word of God;
 <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C1V26">&nbsp;</a><span class="add">Even</span> the mystery which hath been hid from ages and from generations, but now is made manifest to his saints:
 <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C1V27">&nbsp;</a>To whom God would make known what
<span class="add">is</span> the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles; which is Christ in you, the hope of glory:
 <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C1V28">&nbsp;</a>Whom we preach, warning every man, and teaching every man in all wisdom; that we may present every man
perfect in Christ Jesus:
 <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C1V29">&nbsp;</a>Whereunto I also labour, striving according to his working, which worketh in me mightily.
