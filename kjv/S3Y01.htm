<div class="mt1">The Prayer of Azariah
</div>
<div class="chapterlabel"> 1</div><div class="p">
 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C1V1">&nbsp;</a>And they walked in the midst of the fire, praising God, and blessing the Lord.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C1V2">&nbsp;</a>Then Azarias stood up, and prayed on this manner; and opening his mouth in the midst of the fire said,
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C1V3">&nbsp;</a>Blessed art thou, O Lord God of our fathers: thy name is worthy to be praised and glorified for evermore:
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C1V4">&nbsp;</a>For thou art righteous in all the things that thou hast done to us: yea, true are all thy works, thy
ways are right, and all thy judgments truth.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C1V5">&nbsp;</a>In all the things that thou hast brought upon us, and upon the holy city of our fathers, even Jerusalem,
thou hast executed true judgment: for according to truth and judgment didst thou bring all these things
upon us because of our sins.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C1V6">&nbsp;</a>For we have sinned and committed iniquity, departing from thee.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C1V7">&nbsp;</a>In all things have we trespassed, and not obeyed thy commandments, nor kept them, neither done as thou
hast commanded us, that it might go well with us.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C1V8">&nbsp;</a>Wherefore all that thou hast brought upon us, and every thing that thou hast done to us, thou hast done
in true judgment.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C1V9">&nbsp;</a>And thou didst deliver us into the hands of lawless enemies, most hateful forsakers of God, and to an
unjust king, and the most wicked in all the world.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C1V10">&nbsp;</a>And now we cannot open our mouths, we are become a shame and reproach to thy servants; and to them that
worship thee.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C1V11">&nbsp;</a>Yet deliver us not up wholly, for thy name’s sake, neither disannul thou thy covenant:
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C1V12">&nbsp;</a>And cause not thy mercy to depart from us, for thy beloved Abraham’s sake, for thy servant Issac’s sake,
and for thy holy Israel’s sake;
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C1V13">&nbsp;</a>To whom thou hast spoken and promised, that thou wouldest multiply their seed as the stars of heaven,
and as the sand that lieth upon the seashore.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C1V14">&nbsp;</a>For we, O Lord, are become less than any nation, and be kept under this day in all the world because
of our sins.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C1V15">&nbsp;</a>Neither is there at this time prince, or prophet, or leader, or burnt offering, or sacrifice, or oblation,
or incense, or place to sacrifice before thee, and to find mercy.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C1V16">&nbsp;</a>Nevertheless in a contrite heart and an humble spirit let us be accepted.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C1V17">&nbsp;</a>Like as in the burnt offerings of rams and bullocks, and like as in ten thousands of fat lambs: so let
our sacrifice be in thy sight this day, and grant that we may wholly go after thee: for they shall not
be confounded that put their trust in thee.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C1V18">&nbsp;</a>And now we follow thee with all our heart, we fear thee, and seek thy face.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C1V19">&nbsp;</a>Put us not to shame: but deal with us after thy lovingkindness, and according to the multitude of thy
mercies.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C1V20">&nbsp;</a>Deliver us also according to thy marvellous works, and give glory to thy name, O Lord: and let all them
that do thy servants hurt be ashamed;
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C1V21">&nbsp;</a>And let them be confounded in all their power and might, and let their strength be broken;
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C1V22">&nbsp;</a>And let them know that thou art God, the only God, and glorious over the whole world.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C1V23">&nbsp;</a>And the king’s servants, that put them in, ceased not to make the oven hot with rosin, pitch, tow, and
small wood;
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C1V24">&nbsp;</a>So that the flame streamed forth above the furnace forty and nine cubits.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C1V25">&nbsp;</a>And it passed through, and burned those Chaldeans it found about the furnace.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C1V26">&nbsp;</a>But the angel of the Lord came down into the oven together with Azarias and his fellows, and smote the
flame of the fire out of the oven;
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C1V27">&nbsp;</a>And made the midst of the furnace as it had been a moist whistling wind, so that the fire touched them
not at all, neither hurt nor troubled them.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C1V28">&nbsp;</a>Then the three, as out of one mouth, praised, glorified, and blessed, God in the furnace, saying,
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C1V29">&nbsp;</a>Blessed art thou, O Lord God of our fathers: and to be praised and exalted above all for ever.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 30</span><a name="C1V30">&nbsp;</a>And blessed is thy glorious and holy name: and to be praised and exalted above all for ever.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 31</span><a name="C1V31">&nbsp;</a>Blessed art thou in the temple of thine holy glory: and to be praised and glorified above all for ever.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 32</span><a name="C1V32">&nbsp;</a>Blessed art thou that beholdest the depths, and sittest upon the cherubims: and to be praised and exalted
above all for ever.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 33</span><a name="C1V33">&nbsp;</a>Blessed art thou on the glorious throne of thy kingdom: and to be praised and glorified above all for
ever.
