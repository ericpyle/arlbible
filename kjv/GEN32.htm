<div class="chapterlabel"> 32</div><div class="p">
 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C32V1">&nbsp;</a>And Jacob went on his way, and the angels of God met him.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C32V2">&nbsp;</a>And when Jacob saw them, he said, This
<span class="add">is</span> God’s host: and he called the name of that place Mahanaim.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C32V3">&nbsp;</a>And Jacob sent messengers before him to Esau his brother unto the land of Seir, the country of Edom.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C32V4">&nbsp;</a>And he commanded them, saying, Thus shall ye speak unto my lord Esau; Thy servant Jacob saith thus, I
have sojourned with Laban, and stayed there until now:
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C32V5">&nbsp;</a>And I have oxen, and asses, flocks, and menservants, and womenservants: and I have sent to tell my lord,
that I may find grace in thy sight.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C32V6">&nbsp;</a>And the messengers returned to Jacob, saying, We came to thy brother Esau, and also he cometh to meet
thee, and four hundred men with him.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C32V7">&nbsp;</a>Then Jacob was greatly afraid and distressed: and he divided the people that
<span class="add">was</span> with him, and the flocks, and herds, and the camels, into two bands;
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C32V8">&nbsp;</a>And said, If Esau come to the one company, and smite it, then the other company which is left shall escape.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C32V9">&nbsp;</a>And Jacob said, O God of my father Abraham, and God of my father Isaac, the LORD which saidst unto me,
Return unto thy country, and to thy kindred, and I will deal well with thee:
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C32V10">&nbsp;</a>I am not worthy of the least of all the mercies, and of all the truth, which thou hast shewed unto thy
servant; for with my staff I passed over this Jordan; and now I am become two bands.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C32V11">&nbsp;</a>Deliver me, I pray thee, from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau: for I fear him, lest he
will come and smite me,
<span class="add">and</span> the mother with the children.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C32V12">&nbsp;</a>And thou saidst, I will surely do thee good, and make thy seed as the sand of the sea, which cannot be
numbered for multitude.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C32V13">&nbsp;</a>And he lodged there that same night; and took of that which came to his hand a present for Esau his brother;
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C32V14">&nbsp;</a>Two hundred she goats, and twenty he goats, two hundred ewes, and twenty rams,
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C32V15">&nbsp;</a>Thirty milch camels with their colts, forty kine, and ten bulls, twenty she asses, and ten foals.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C32V16">&nbsp;</a>And he delivered
<span class="add">them</span> into the hand of his servants, every drove by themselves; and said unto his servants, Pass over before
me, and put a space betwixt drove and drove.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C32V17">&nbsp;</a>And he commanded the foremost, saying, When Esau my brother meeteth thee, and asketh thee, saying, Whose
<span class="add">art</span> thou? and whither goest thou? and whose
<span class="add">are</span> these before thee?
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C32V18">&nbsp;</a>Then thou shalt say,
<span class="add">They be</span> thy servant Jacob’s; it
<span class="add">is</span> a present sent unto my lord Esau: and, behold, also he
<span class="add">is</span> behind us.
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C32V19">&nbsp;</a>And so commanded he the second, and the third, and all that followed the droves, saying, On this manner
shall ye speak unto Esau, when ye find him.
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C32V20">&nbsp;</a>And say ye moreover, Behold, thy servant Jacob
<span class="add">is</span> behind us. For he said, I will appease him with the present that goeth before me, and afterward I will
see his face; peradventure he will accept of me.
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C32V21">&nbsp;</a>So went the present over before him: and himself lodged that night in the company.
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C32V22">&nbsp;</a>And he rose up that night, and took his two wives, and his two womenservants, and his eleven sons, and
passed over the ford Jabbok.
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C32V23">&nbsp;</a>And he took them, and sent them over the brook, and sent over that he had.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C32V24">&nbsp;</a>And Jacob was left alone; and there wrestled a man with him until the breaking of the day.
 <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C32V25">&nbsp;</a>And when he saw that he prevailed not against him, he touched the hollow of his thigh; and the hollow
of Jacob’s thigh was out of joint, as he wrestled with him.
 <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C32V26">&nbsp;</a>And he said, Let me go, for the day breaketh. And he said, I will not let thee go, except thou bless
me.
 <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C32V27">&nbsp;</a>And he said unto him, What
<span class="add">is</span> thy name? And he said, Jacob.
 <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C32V28">&nbsp;</a>And he said, Thy name shall be called no more Jacob, but Israel: for as a prince hast thou power with
God and with men, and hast prevailed.
 <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C32V29">&nbsp;</a>And Jacob asked
<span class="add">him,</span> and said, Tell
<span class="add">me,</span> I pray thee, thy name. And he said, Wherefore
<span class="add">is</span> it
<span class="add">that</span> thou dost ask after my name? And he blessed him there.
 <span class="verse"> 30</span><a name="C32V30">&nbsp;</a>And Jacob called the name of the place Peniel: for I have seen God face to face, and my life is preserved.
 <span class="verse"> 31</span><a name="C32V31">&nbsp;</a>And as he passed over Penuel the sun rose upon him, and he halted upon his thigh.
 <span class="verse"> 32</span><a name="C32V32">&nbsp;</a>Therefore the children of Israel eat not
<span class="add">of</span> the sinew which shrank, which
<span class="add">is</span> upon the hollow of the thigh, unto this day: because he touched the hollow of Jacob’s thigh in the sinew
that shrank.
