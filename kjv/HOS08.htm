 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C8V1">&nbsp;</a><span class="add">Set</span> the trumpet to thy mouth.
<span class="add">He shall come</span> as an eagle against the house of the LORD, because they have transgressed my covenant, and trespassed
against my law.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C8V2">&nbsp;</a>Israel shall cry unto me, My God, we know thee.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C8V3">&nbsp;</a>Israel hath cast off
<span class="add">the thing that is</span> good: the enemy shall pursue him.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C8V4">&nbsp;</a>They have set up kings, but not by me: they have made princes, and I knew
<span class="add">it</span> not: of their silver and their gold have they made them idols, that they may be cut off.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C8V5">&nbsp;</a>Thy calf, O Samaria, hath cast
<span class="add">thee</span> off; mine anger is kindled against them: how long
<span class="add">will it be</span> ere they attain to innocency?
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C8V6">&nbsp;</a>For from Israel
<span class="add">was</span> it also: the workman made it; therefore it
<span class="add">is</span> not God: but the calf of Samaria shall be broken in pieces.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C8V7">&nbsp;</a>For they have sown the wind, and they shall reap the whirlwind: it hath no stalk: the bud shall yield
no meal: if so be it yield, the strangers shall swallow it up.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C8V8">&nbsp;</a>Israel is swallowed up: now shall they be among the Gentiles as a vessel wherein
<span class="add">is</span> no pleasure.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C8V9">&nbsp;</a>For they are gone up to Assyria, a wild ass alone by himself: Ephraim hath hired lovers.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C8V10">&nbsp;</a>Yea, though they have hired among the nations, now will I gather them, and they shall sorrow a little
for the burden of the king of princes.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C8V11">&nbsp;</a>Because Ephraim hath made many altars to sin, altars shall be unto him to sin.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C8V12">&nbsp;</a>I have written to him the great things of my law,
<span class="add">but</span> they were counted as a strange thing.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C8V13">&nbsp;</a>They sacrifice flesh
<span class="add">for</span> the sacrifices of mine offerings, and
<span class="add">eat it;</span> but the LORD accepteth them not; now will he remember their iniquity, and visit their sins: they shall
return to Egypt.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C8V14">&nbsp;</a>For Israel hath forgotten his Maker, and buildeth temples; and Judah hath multiplied fenced cities: but
I will send a fire upon his cities, and it shall devour the palaces thereof.
