 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C12V1">&nbsp;</a>And Samuel said unto all Israel, Behold, I have hearkened unto your voice in all that ye said unto me,
and have made a king over you.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C12V2">&nbsp;</a>And now, behold, the king walketh before you: and I am old and grayheaded; and, behold, my sons
<span class="add">are</span> with you: and I have walked before you from my childhood unto this day.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C12V3">&nbsp;</a>Behold, here I
<span class="add">am:</span> witness against me before the LORD, and before his anointed: whose ox have I taken? or whose ass have
I taken? or whom have I defrauded? whom have I oppressed? or of whose hand have I received
<span class="add">any</span> bribe to blind mine eyes therewith? and I will restore it you.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C12V4">&nbsp;</a>And they said, Thou hast not defrauded us, nor oppressed us, neither hast thou taken ought of any man’s
hand.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C12V5">&nbsp;</a>And he said unto them, The LORD
<span class="add">is</span> witness against you, and his anointed
<span class="add">is</span> witness this day, that ye have not found ought in my hand. And they answered,
<span class="add">He is</span> witness.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C12V6">&nbsp;</a>And Samuel said unto the people,
<span class="add">It is</span> the LORD that advanced Moses and Aaron, and that brought your fathers up out of the land of Egypt.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C12V7">&nbsp;</a>Now therefore stand still, that I may reason with you before the LORD of all the righteous acts of the
LORD, which he did to you and to your fathers.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C12V8">&nbsp;</a>When Jacob was come into Egypt, and your fathers cried unto the LORD, then the LORD sent Moses and Aaron,
which brought forth your fathers out of Egypt, and made them dwell in this place.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C12V9">&nbsp;</a>And when they forgat the LORD their God, he sold them into the hand of Sisera, captain of the host of
Hazor, and into the hand of the Philistines, and into the hand of the king of Moab, and they fought against
them.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C12V10">&nbsp;</a>And they cried unto the LORD, and said, We have sinned, because we have forsaken the LORD, and have served
Baalim and Ashtaroth: but now deliver us out of the hand of our enemies, and we will serve thee.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C12V11">&nbsp;</a>And the LORD sent Jerubbaal, and Bedan, and Jephthah, and Samuel, and delivered you out of the hand of
your enemies on every side, and ye dwelled safe.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C12V12">&nbsp;</a>And when ye saw that Nahash the king of the children of Ammon came against you, ye said unto me, Nay;
but a king shall reign over us: when the LORD your God
<span class="add">was</span> your king.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C12V13">&nbsp;</a>Now therefore behold the king whom ye have chosen,
<span class="add">and</span> whom ye have desired! and, behold, the LORD hath set a king over you.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C12V14">&nbsp;</a>If ye will fear the LORD, and serve him, and obey his voice, and not rebel against the commandment of
the LORD, then shall both ye and also the king that reigneth over you continue following the LORD your
God:
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C12V15">&nbsp;</a>But if ye will not obey the voice of the LORD, but rebel against the commandment of the LORD, then shall
the hand of the LORD be against you, as
<span class="add">it was</span> against your fathers.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C12V16">&nbsp;</a>Now therefore stand and see this great thing, which the LORD will do before your eyes.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C12V17">&nbsp;</a><span class="add">Is it</span> not wheat harvest to day? I will call unto the LORD, and he shall send thunder and rain; that ye may
perceive and see that your wickedness
<span class="add">is</span> great, which ye have done in the sight of the LORD, in asking you a king.
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C12V18">&nbsp;</a>So Samuel called unto the LORD; and the LORD sent thunder and rain that day: and all the people greatly
feared the LORD and Samuel.
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C12V19">&nbsp;</a>And all the people said unto Samuel, Pray for thy servants unto the LORD thy God, that we die not: for
we have added unto all our sins
<span class="add">this</span> evil, to ask us a king.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C12V20">&nbsp;</a>And Samuel said unto the people, Fear not: ye have done all this wickedness: yet turn not aside from
following the LORD, but serve the LORD with all your heart;
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C12V21">&nbsp;</a>And turn ye not aside: for
<span class="add">then should ye go</span> after vain
<span class="add">things,</span> which cannot profit nor deliver; for they
<span class="add">are</span> vain.
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C12V22">&nbsp;</a>For the LORD will not forsake his people for his great name’s sake: because it hath pleased the LORD
to make you his people.
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C12V23">&nbsp;</a>Moreover as for me, God forbid that I should sin against the LORD in ceasing to pray for you: but I will
teach you the good and the right way:
 <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C12V24">&nbsp;</a>Only fear the LORD, and serve him in truth with all your heart: for consider how great
<span class="add">things</span> he hath done for you.
 <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C12V25">&nbsp;</a>But if ye shall still do wickedly, ye shall be consumed, both ye and your king.
