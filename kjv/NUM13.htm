 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C13V1">&nbsp;</a>And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C13V2">&nbsp;</a>Send thou men, that they may search the land of Canaan, which I give unto the children of Israel: of
every tribe of their fathers shall ye send a man, every one a ruler among them.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C13V3">&nbsp;</a>And Moses by the commandment of the LORD sent them from the wilderness of Paran: all those men
<span class="add">were</span> heads of the children of Israel.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C13V4">&nbsp;</a>And these
<span class="add">were</span> their names: of the tribe of Reuben, Shammua the son of Zaccur.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C13V5">&nbsp;</a>Of the tribe of Simeon, Shaphat the son of Hori.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C13V6">&nbsp;</a>Of the tribe of Judah, Caleb the son of Jephunneh.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C13V7">&nbsp;</a>Of the tribe of Issachar, Igal the son of Joseph.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C13V8">&nbsp;</a>Of the tribe of Ephraim, Oshea the son of Nun.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C13V9">&nbsp;</a>Of the tribe of Benjamin, Palti the son of Raphu.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C13V10">&nbsp;</a>Of the tribe of Zebulun, Gaddiel the son of Sodi.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C13V11">&nbsp;</a>Of the tribe of Joseph, namely, of the tribe of Manasseh, Gaddi the son of Susi.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C13V12">&nbsp;</a>Of the tribe of Dan, Ammiel the son of Gemalli.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C13V13">&nbsp;</a>Of the tribe of Asher, Sethur the son of Michael.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C13V14">&nbsp;</a>Of the tribe of Naphtali, Nahbi the son of Vophsi.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C13V15">&nbsp;</a>Of the tribe of Gad, Geuel the son of Machi.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C13V16">&nbsp;</a>These
<span class="add">are</span> the names of the men which Moses sent to spy out the land. And Moses called Oshea the son of Nun Jehoshua.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C13V17">&nbsp;</a>And Moses sent them to spy out the land of Canaan, and said unto them, Get you up this
<span class="add">way</span> southward, and go up into the mountain:
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C13V18">&nbsp;</a>And see the land, what it
<span class="add">is;</span> and the people that dwelleth therein, whether they
<span class="add">be</span> strong or weak, few or many;
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C13V19">&nbsp;</a>And what the land
<span class="add">is</span> that they dwell in, whether it
<span class="add">be</span> good or bad; and what cities
<span class="add">they be</span> that they dwell in, whether in tents, or in strong holds;
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C13V20">&nbsp;</a>And what the land
<span class="add">is,</span> whether it
<span class="add">be</span> fat or lean, whether there be wood therein, or not. And be ye of good courage, and bring of the fruit
of the land. Now the time
<span class="add">was</span> the time of the firstripe grapes.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C13V21">&nbsp;</a>So they went up, and searched the land from the wilderness of Zin unto Rehob, as men come to Hamath.
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C13V22">&nbsp;</a>And they ascended by the south, and came unto Hebron; where Ahiman, Sheshai, and Talmai, the children
of Anak,
<span class="add">were.</span> (Now Hebron was built seven years before Zoan in Egypt.)
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C13V23">&nbsp;</a>And they came unto the brook of Eshcol, and cut down from thence a branch with one cluster of grapes,
and they bare it between two upon a staff; and
<span class="add">they brought</span> of the pomegranates, and of the figs.
 <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C13V24">&nbsp;</a>The place was called the brook Eshcol, because of the cluster of grapes which the children of Israel
cut down from thence.
 <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C13V25">&nbsp;</a>And they returned from searching of the land after forty days.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C13V26">&nbsp;</a>And they went and came to Moses, and to Aaron, and to all the congregation of the children of Israel,
unto the wilderness of Paran, to Kadesh; and brought back word unto them, and unto all the congregation,
and shewed them the fruit of the land.
 <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C13V27">&nbsp;</a>And they told him, and said, We came unto the land whither thou sentest us, and surely it floweth with
milk and honey; and this
<span class="add">is</span> the fruit of it.
 <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C13V28">&nbsp;</a>Nevertheless the people
<span class="add">be</span> strong that dwell in the land, and the cities
<span class="add">are</span> walled,
<span class="add">and</span> very great: and moreover we saw the children of Anak there.
 <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C13V29">&nbsp;</a>The Amalekites dwell in the land of the south: and the Hittites, and the Jebusites, and the Amorites,
dwell in the mountains: and the Canaanites dwell by the sea, and by the coast of Jordan.
 <span class="verse"> 30</span><a name="C13V30">&nbsp;</a>And Caleb stilled the people before Moses, and said, Let us go up at once, and possess it; for we are
well able to overcome it.
 <span class="verse"> 31</span><a name="C13V31">&nbsp;</a>But the men that went up with him said, We be not able to go up against the people; for they are stronger
than we.
 <span class="verse"> 32</span><a name="C13V32">&nbsp;</a>And they brought up an evil report of the land which they had searched unto the children of Israel, saying,
The land, through which we have gone to search it, is a land that eateth up the inhabitants thereof;
and all the people that we saw in it
<span class="add">are</span> men of a great stature.
 <span class="verse"> 33</span><a name="C13V33">&nbsp;</a>And there we saw the giants, the sons of Anak,
<span class="add">which come</span> of the giants: and we were in our own sight as grasshoppers, and so we were in their sight.
