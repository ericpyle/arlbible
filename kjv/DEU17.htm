 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C17V1">&nbsp;</a>Thou shalt not sacrifice unto the LORD thy God
<span class="add">any</span> bullock, or sheep, wherein is blemish,
<span class="add">or</span> any evilfavouredness: for that
<span class="add">is</span> an abomination unto the LORD thy God.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C17V2">&nbsp;</a>If there be found among you, within any of thy gates which the LORD thy God giveth thee, man or woman,
that hath wrought wickedness in the sight of the LORD thy God, in transgressing his covenant,
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C17V3">&nbsp;</a>And hath gone and served other gods, and worshipped them, either the sun, or moon, or any of the host
of heaven, which I have not commanded;
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C17V4">&nbsp;</a>And it be told thee, and thou hast heard
<span class="add">of it,</span> and enquired diligently, and, behold,
<span class="add">it be</span> true,
<span class="add">and</span> the thing certain,
<span class="add">that</span> such abomination is wrought in Israel:
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C17V5">&nbsp;</a>Then shalt thou bring forth that man or that woman, which have committed that wicked thing, unto thy
gates,
<span class="add">even</span> that man or that woman, and shalt stone them with stones, till they die.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C17V6">&nbsp;</a>At the mouth of two witnesses, or three witnesses, shall he that is worthy of death be put to death;
<span class="add">but</span> at the mouth of one witness he shall not be put to death.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C17V7">&nbsp;</a>The hands of the witnesses shall be first upon him to put him to death, and afterward the hands of all
the people. So thou shalt put the evil away from among you.

<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C17V8">&nbsp;</a>If there arise a matter too hard for thee in judgment, between blood and blood, between plea and plea,
and between stroke and stroke,
<span class="add">being
</span> matters of controversy within thy gates: then shalt thou arise, and get thee up into the place which
the LORD thy God shall choose;
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C17V9">&nbsp;</a>And thou shalt come unto the priests the Levites, and unto the judge that shall be in those days, and
enquire; and they shall shew thee the sentence of judgment:
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C17V10">&nbsp;</a>And thou shalt do according to the sentence, which they of that place which the LORD shall choose shall
shew thee; and thou shalt observe to do according to all that they inform thee:
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C17V11">&nbsp;</a>According to the sentence of the law which they shall teach thee, and according to the judgment which
they shall tell thee, thou shalt do: thou shalt not decline from the sentence which they shall shew thee,
<span class="add">to
</span> the right hand, nor
<span class="add">to</span> the left.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C17V12">&nbsp;</a>And the man that will do presumptuously, and will not hearken unto the priest that standeth to minister
there before the LORD thy God, or unto the judge, even that man shall die: and thou shalt put away the
evil from Israel.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C17V13">&nbsp;</a>And all the people shall hear, and fear, and do no more presumptuously.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C17V14">&nbsp;</a>When thou art come unto the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee, and shalt possess it, and shalt
dwell therein, and shalt say, I will set a king over me, like as all the nations that
<span class="add">are</span> about me;
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C17V15">&nbsp;</a>Thou shalt in any wise set
<span class="add">him</span> king over thee, whom the LORD thy God shall choose:
<span class="add">one</span> from among thy brethren shalt thou set king over thee: thou mayest not set a stranger over thee, which
<span class="add">is
</span> not thy brother.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C17V16">&nbsp;</a>But he shall not multiply horses to himself, nor cause the people to return to Egypt, to the end that
he should multiply horses: forasmuch as the LORD hath said unto you, Ye shall henceforth return no more
that way.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C17V17">&nbsp;</a>Neither shall he multiply wives to himself, that his heart turn not away: neither shall he greatly multiply
to himself silver and gold.
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C17V18">&nbsp;</a>And it shall be, when he sitteth upon the throne of his kingdom, that he shall write him a copy of this
law in a book out of
<span class="add">that which is
</span> before the priests the Levites:
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C17V19">&nbsp;</a>And it shall be with him, and he shall read therein all the days of his life: that he may learn to fear
the LORD his God, to keep all the words of this law and these statutes, to do them:
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C17V20">&nbsp;</a>That his heart be not lifted up above his brethren, and that he turn not aside from the commandment,
<span class="add">to</span> the right hand, or
<span class="add">to
</span> the left: to the end that he may prolong
<span class="add">his</span> days in his kingdom, he, and his children, in the midst of Israel.
