 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C18V1">&nbsp;</a>The word which came to Jeremiah from the LORD, saying,
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C18V2">&nbsp;</a>Arise, and go down to the potter’s house, and there I will cause thee to hear my words.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C18V3">&nbsp;</a>Then I went down to the potter’s house, and, behold, he wrought a work on the wheels.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C18V4">&nbsp;</a>And the vessel that he made of clay was marred in the hand of the potter: so he made it again another
vessel, as seemed good to the potter to make
<span class="add">it.
</span> <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C18V5">&nbsp;</a>Then the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C18V6">&nbsp;</a>O house of Israel, cannot I do with you as this potter? saith the LORD. Behold, as the clay
<span class="add">is</span> in the potter’s hand, so
<span class="add">are</span> ye in mine hand, O house of Israel.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C18V7">&nbsp;</a><span class="add">At what</span> instant I shall speak concerning a nation, and concerning a kingdom, to pluck up, and to pull down,
and to destroy
<span class="add">it;
</span> <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C18V8">&nbsp;</a>If that nation, against whom I have pronounced, turn from their evil, I will repent of the evil that
I thought to do unto them.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C18V9">&nbsp;</a>And
<span class="add">at what</span> instant I shall speak concerning a nation, and concerning a kingdom, to build and to plant
<span class="add">it;
</span> <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C18V10">&nbsp;</a>If it do evil in my sight, that it obey not my voice, then I will repent of the good, wherewith I said
I would benefit them.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C18V11">&nbsp;</a>Now therefore go to, speak to the men of Judah, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, saying, Thus saith
the LORD; Behold, I frame evil against you, and devise a device against you: return ye now every one
from his evil way, and make your ways and your doings good.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C18V12">&nbsp;</a>And they said, There is no hope: but we will walk after our own devices, and we will every one do the
imagination of his evil heart.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C18V13">&nbsp;</a>Therefore thus saith the LORD; Ask ye now among the heathen, who hath heard such things: the virgin of
Israel hath done a very horrible thing.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C18V14">&nbsp;</a>Will
<span class="add">a man</span> leave the snow of Lebanon
<span class="add">which cometh
</span> from the rock of the field?
<span class="add">or</span> shall the cold flowing waters that come from another place be forsaken?
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C18V15">&nbsp;</a>Because my people hath forgotten me, they have burned incense to vanity, and they have caused them to
stumble in their ways
<span class="add">from</span> the ancient paths, to walk in paths,
<span class="add">in</span> a way not cast up;
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C18V16">&nbsp;</a>To make their land desolate,
<span class="add">and</span> a perpetual hissing; every one that passeth thereby shall be astonished, and wag his head.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C18V17">&nbsp;</a>I will scatter them as with an east wind before the enemy; I will shew them the back, and not the face,
in the day of their calamity.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C18V18">&nbsp;</a>Then said they, Come, and let us devise devices against Jeremiah; for the law shall not perish from the
priest, nor counsel from the wise, nor the word from the prophet. Come, and let us smite him with the
tongue, and let us not give heed to any of his words.
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C18V19">&nbsp;</a>Give heed to me, O LORD, and hearken to the voice of them that contend with me.
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C18V20">&nbsp;</a>Shall evil be recompensed for good? for they have digged a pit for my soul. Remember that I stood before
thee to speak good for them,
<span class="add">and
</span> to turn away thy wrath from them.
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C18V21">&nbsp;</a>Therefore deliver up their children to the famine, and pour out their
<span class="add">blood</span> by the force of the sword; and let their wives be bereaved of their children, and
<span class="add">be</span> widows; and let their men be put to death;
<span class="add">let</span> their young men
<span class="add">be</span> slain by the sword in battle.
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C18V22">&nbsp;</a>Let a cry be heard from their houses, when thou shalt bring a troop suddenly upon them: for they have
digged a pit to take me, and hid snares for my feet.
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C18V23">&nbsp;</a>Yet, LORD, thou knowest all their counsel against me to slay
<span class="add">me:
</span> forgive not their iniquity, neither blot out their sin from thy sight, but let them be overthrown before
thee; deal
<span class="add">thus</span> with them in the time of thine anger.
