 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C4V1">&nbsp;</a>What shall we say then that Abraham our father, as pertaining to the flesh, hath found?
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C4V2">&nbsp;</a>For if Abraham were justified by works, he hath
<span class="add">whereof</span> to glory; but not before God.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C4V3">&nbsp;</a>For what saith the scripture? Abraham believed God, and it was counted unto him for righteousness.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C4V4">&nbsp;</a>Now to him that worketh is the reward not reckoned of grace, but of debt.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C4V5">&nbsp;</a>But to him that worketh not, but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly, his faith is counted for
righteousness.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C4V6">&nbsp;</a>Even as David also describeth the blessedness of the man, unto whom God imputeth righteousness without
works,
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C4V7">&nbsp;</a><span class="add">Saying,</span> Blessed
<span class="add">are</span> they whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose sins are covered.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C4V8">&nbsp;</a>Blessed
<span class="add">is</span> the man to whom the Lord will not impute sin.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C4V9">&nbsp;</a><span class="add">Cometh</span> this blessedness then upon the circumcision
<span class="add">only,</span> or upon the uncircumcision also? for we say that faith was reckoned to Abraham for righteousness.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C4V10">&nbsp;</a>How was it then reckoned? when he was in circumcision, or in uncircumcision? Not in circumcision, but
in uncircumcision.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C4V11">&nbsp;</a>And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith which
<span class="add">he had yet</span> being uncircumcised: that he might be the father of all them that believe, though they be not circumcised;
that righteousness might be imputed unto them also:
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C4V12">&nbsp;</a>And the father of circumcision to them who are not of the circumcision only, but who also walk in the
steps of that faith of our father Abraham, which
<span class="add">he had</span> being
<span class="add">yet</span> uncircumcised.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C4V13">&nbsp;</a>For the promise, that he should be the heir of the world,
<span class="add">was</span> not to Abraham, or to his seed, through the law, but through the righteousness of faith.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C4V14">&nbsp;</a>For if they which are of the law
<span class="add">be</span> heirs, faith is made void, and the promise made of none effect:
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C4V15">&nbsp;</a>Because the law worketh wrath: for where no law is,
<span class="add">there is</span> no transgression.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C4V16">&nbsp;</a>Therefore
<span class="add">it is</span> of faith, that
<span class="add">it might be</span> by grace; to the end the promise might be sure to all the seed; not to that only which is of the law,
but to that also which is of the faith of Abraham; who is the father of us all,
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C4V17">&nbsp;</a>(As it is written, I have made thee a father of many nations,) before him whom he believed,
<span class="add">even</span> God, who quickeneth the dead, and calleth those things which be not as though they were.
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C4V18">&nbsp;</a>Who against hope believed in hope, that he might become the father of many nations, according to that
which was spoken, So shall thy seed be.
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C4V19">&nbsp;</a>And being not weak in faith, he considered not his own body now dead, when he was about an hundred years
old, neither yet the deadness of Sarah’s womb:
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C4V20">&nbsp;</a>He staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief; but was strong in faith, giving glory to God;
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C4V21">&nbsp;</a>And being fully persuaded that, what he had promised, he was able also to perform.
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C4V22">&nbsp;</a>And therefore it was imputed to him for righteousness.
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C4V23">&nbsp;</a>Now it was not written for his sake alone, that it was imputed to him;
 <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C4V24">&nbsp;</a>But for us also, to whom it shall be imputed, if we believe on him that raised up Jesus our Lord from
the dead;
 <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C4V25">&nbsp;</a>Who was delivered for our offences, and was raised again for our justification.
