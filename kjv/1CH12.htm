 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C12V1">&nbsp;</a>Now these
<span class="add">are</span> they that came to David to Ziklag, while he yet kept himself close because of Saul the son of Kish:
and they
<span class="add">were</span> among the mighty men, helpers of the war.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C12V2">&nbsp;</a><span class="add">They were</span> armed with bows, and could use both the right hand and the left in
<span class="add">hurling</span> stones and
<span class="add">shooting</span> arrows out of a bow,
<span class="add">even</span> of Saul’s brethren of Benjamin.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C12V3">&nbsp;</a>The chief
<span class="add">was</span> Ahiezer, then Joash, the sons of Shemaah the Gibeathite; and Jeziel, and Pelet, the sons of Azmaveth;
and Berachah, and Jehu the Antothite,
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C12V4">&nbsp;</a>And Ismaiah the Gibeonite, a mighty man among the thirty, and over the thirty; and Jeremiah, and Jahaziel,
and Johanan, and Josabad the Gederathite,
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C12V5">&nbsp;</a>Eluzai, and Jerimoth, and Bealiah, and Shemariah, and Shephatiah the Haruphite,
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C12V6">&nbsp;</a>Elkanah, and Jesiah, and Azareel, and Joezer, and Jashobeam, the Korhites,
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C12V7">&nbsp;</a>And Joelah, and Zebadiah, the sons of Jeroham of Gedor.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C12V8">&nbsp;</a>And of the Gadites there separated themselves unto David into the hold to the wilderness men of might,
<span class="add">and</span> men of war
<span class="add">fit</span> for the battle, that could handle shield and buckler, whose faces
<span class="add">were like</span> the faces of lions, and
<span class="add">were</span> as swift as the roes upon the mountains;
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C12V9">&nbsp;</a>Ezer the first, Obadiah the second, Eliab the third,
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C12V10">&nbsp;</a>Mishmannah the fourth, Jeremiah the fifth,
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C12V11">&nbsp;</a>Attai the sixth, Eliel the seventh,
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C12V12">&nbsp;</a>Johanan the eighth, Elzabad the ninth,
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C12V13">&nbsp;</a>Jeremiah the tenth, Machbanai the eleventh.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C12V14">&nbsp;</a>These
<span class="add">were</span> of the sons of Gad, captains of the host: one of the least
<span class="add">was</span> over an hundred, and the greatest over a thousand.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C12V15">&nbsp;</a>These
<span class="add">are</span> they that went over Jordan in the first month, when it had overflown all his banks; and they put to
flight all
<span class="add">them</span> of the valleys,
<span class="add">both</span> toward the east, and toward the west.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C12V16">&nbsp;</a>And there came of the children of Benjamin and Judah to the hold unto David.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C12V17">&nbsp;</a>And David went out to meet them, and answered and said unto them, If ye be come peaceably unto me to
help me, mine heart shall be knit unto you: but if
<span class="add">ye be come</span> to betray me to mine enemies, seeing
<span class="add">there is</span> no wrong in mine hands, the God of our fathers look
<span class="add">thereon,</span> and rebuke
<span class="add">it.
</span> <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C12V18">&nbsp;</a>Then the spirit came upon Amasai,
<span class="add">who was</span> chief of the captains,
<span class="add">and he said,</span> Thine
<span class="add">are we,</span> David, and on thy side, thou son of Jesse: peace, peace
<span class="add">be</span> unto thee, and peace
<span class="add">be</span> to thine helpers; for thy God helpeth thee. Then David received them, and made them captains of the
band.
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C12V19">&nbsp;</a>And there fell
<span class="add">some</span> of Manasseh to David, when he came with the Philistines against Saul to battle: but they helped them
not: for the lords of the Philistines upon advisement sent him away, saying, He will fall to his master
Saul to
<span class="add">the jeopardy of</span> our heads.
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C12V20">&nbsp;</a>As he went to Ziklag, there fell to him of Manasseh, Adnah, and Jozabad, and Jediael, and Michael, and
Jozabad, and Elihu, and Zilthai, captains of the thousands that
<span class="add">were</span> of Manasseh.
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C12V21">&nbsp;</a>And they helped David against the band
<span class="add">of the rovers:</span> for they
<span class="add">were</span> all mighty men of valour, and were captains in the host.
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C12V22">&nbsp;</a>For at
<span class="add">that</span> time day by day there came to David to help him, until
<span class="add">it was</span> a great host, like the host of God.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C12V23">&nbsp;</a>And these
<span class="add">are</span> the numbers of the bands
<span class="add">that were</span> ready armed to the war,
<span class="add">and</span> came to David to Hebron, to turn the kingdom of Saul to him, according to the word of the LORD.
 <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C12V24">&nbsp;</a>The children of Judah that bare shield and spear
<span class="add">were</span> six thousand and eight hundred, ready armed to the war.
 <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C12V25">&nbsp;</a>Of the children of Simeon, mighty men of valour for the war, seven thousand and one hundred.
 <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C12V26">&nbsp;</a>Of the children of Levi four thousand and six hundred.
 <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C12V27">&nbsp;</a>And Jehoiada
<span class="add">was</span> the leader of the Aaronites, and with him
<span class="add">were</span> three thousand and seven hundred;
 <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C12V28">&nbsp;</a>And Zadok, a young man mighty of valour, and of his father’s house twenty and two captains.
 <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C12V29">&nbsp;</a>And of the children of Benjamin, the kindred of Saul, three thousand: for hitherto the greatest part
of them had kept the ward of the house of Saul.
 <span class="verse"> 30</span><a name="C12V30">&nbsp;</a>And of the children of Ephraim twenty thousand and eight hundred, mighty men of valour, famous throughout
the house of their fathers.
 <span class="verse"> 31</span><a name="C12V31">&nbsp;</a>And of the half tribe of Manasseh eighteen thousand, which were expressed by name, to come and make David
king.
 <span class="verse"> 32</span><a name="C12V32">&nbsp;</a>And of the children of Issachar,
<span class="add">which were men</span> that had understanding of the times, to know what Israel ought to do; the heads of them
<span class="add">were</span> two hundred; and all their brethren
<span class="add">were</span> at their commandment.
 <span class="verse"> 33</span><a name="C12V33">&nbsp;</a>Of Zebulun, such as went forth to battle, expert in war, with all instruments of war, fifty thousand,
which could keep rank:
<span class="add">they were</span> not of double heart.
 <span class="verse"> 34</span><a name="C12V34">&nbsp;</a>And of Naphtali a thousand captains, and with them with shield and spear thirty and seven thousand.
 <span class="verse"> 35</span><a name="C12V35">&nbsp;</a>And of the Danites expert in war twenty and eight thousand and six hundred.
 <span class="verse"> 36</span><a name="C12V36">&nbsp;</a>And of Asher, such as went forth to battle, expert in war, forty thousand.
 <span class="verse"> 37</span><a name="C12V37">&nbsp;</a>And on the other side of Jordan, of the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and of the half tribe of Manasseh,
with all manner of instruments of war for the battle, an hundred and twenty thousand.
 <span class="verse"> 38</span><a name="C12V38">&nbsp;</a>All these men of war, that could keep rank, came with a perfect heart to Hebron, to make David king over
all Israel: and all the rest also of Israel
<span class="add">were</span> of one heart to make David king.
 <span class="verse"> 39</span><a name="C12V39">&nbsp;</a>And there they were with David three days, eating and drinking: for their brethren had prepared for them.
 <span class="verse"> 40</span><a name="C12V40">&nbsp;</a>Moreover they that were nigh them,
<span class="add">even</span> unto Issachar and Zebulun and Naphtali, brought bread on asses, and on camels, and on mules, and on
oxen,
<span class="add">and</span> meat, meal, cakes of figs, and bunches of raisins, and wine, and oil, and oxen, and sheep abundantly:
for
<span class="add">there was</span> joy in Israel.
