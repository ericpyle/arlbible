 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C18V1">&nbsp;</a>And David numbered the people that
<span class="add">were</span> with him, and set captains of thousands and captains of hundreds over them.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C18V2">&nbsp;</a>And David sent forth a third part of the people under the hand of Joab, and a third part under the hand
of Abishai the son of Zeruiah, Joab’s brother, and a third part under the hand of Ittai the Gittite.
And the king said unto the people, I will surely go forth with you myself also.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C18V3">&nbsp;</a>But the people answered, Thou shalt not go forth: for if we flee away, they will not care for us; neither
if half of us die, will they care for us: but now
<span class="add">thou art</span> worth ten thousand of us: therefore now
<span class="add">it is</span> better that thou succour us out of the city.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C18V4">&nbsp;</a>And the king said unto them, What seemeth you best I will do. And the king stood by the gate side, and
all the people came out by hundreds and by thousands.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C18V5">&nbsp;</a>And the king commanded Joab and Abishai and Ittai, saying,
<span class="add">Deal</span> gently for my sake with the young man,
<span class="add">even</span> with Absalom. And all the people heard when the king gave all the captains charge concerning Absalom.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C18V6">&nbsp;</a>So the people went out into the field against Israel: and the battle was in the wood of Ephraim;
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C18V7">&nbsp;</a>Where the people of Israel were slain before the servants of David, and there was there a great slaughter
that day of twenty thousand
<span class="add">men.
</span> <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C18V8">&nbsp;</a>For the battle was there scattered over the face of all the country: and the wood devoured more people
that day than the sword devoured.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C18V9">&nbsp;</a>And Absalom met the servants of David. And Absalom rode upon a mule, and the mule went under the thick
boughs of a great oak, and his head caught hold of the oak, and he was taken up between the heaven and
the earth; and the mule that
<span class="add">was</span> under him went away.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C18V10">&nbsp;</a>And a certain man saw it, and told Joab, and said, Behold, I saw Absalom hanged in an oak.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C18V11">&nbsp;</a>And Joab said unto the man that told him, And, behold, thou sawest
<span class="add">him,</span> and why didst thou not smite him there to the ground? and I would have given thee ten
<span class="add">shekels</span> of silver, and a girdle.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C18V12">&nbsp;</a>And the man said unto Joab, Though I should receive a thousand
<span class="add">shekels</span> of silver in mine hand, yet would I not put forth mine hand against the king’s son: for in our hearing
the king charged thee and Abishai and Ittai, saying, Beware that none
<span class="add">touch</span> the young man Absalom.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C18V13">&nbsp;</a>Otherwise I should have wrought falsehood against mine own life: for there is no matter hid from the
king, and thou thyself wouldest have set thyself against
<span class="add">me.
</span> <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C18V14">&nbsp;</a>Then said Joab, I may not tarry thus with thee. And he took three darts in his hand, and thrust them
through the heart of Absalom, while he
<span class="add">was</span> yet alive in the midst of the oak.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C18V15">&nbsp;</a>And ten young men that bare Joab’s armour compassed about and smote Absalom, and slew him.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C18V16">&nbsp;</a>And Joab blew the trumpet, and the people returned from pursuing after Israel: for Joab held back the
people.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C18V17">&nbsp;</a>And they took Absalom, and cast him into a great pit in the wood, and laid a very great heap of stones
upon him: and all Israel fled every one to his tent.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C18V18">&nbsp;</a>Now Absalom in his lifetime had taken and reared up for himself a pillar, which
<span class="add">is</span> in the king’s dale: for he said, I have no son to keep my name in remembrance: and he called the pillar
after his own name: and it is called unto this day, Absalom’s place.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C18V19">&nbsp;</a>Then said Ahimaaz the son of Zadok, Let me now run, and bear the king tidings, how that the LORD hath
avenged him of his enemies.
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C18V20">&nbsp;</a>And Joab said unto him, Thou shalt not bear tidings this day, but thou shalt bear tidings another day:
but this day thou shalt bear no tidings, because the king’s son is dead.
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C18V21">&nbsp;</a>Then said Joab to Cushi, Go tell the king what thou hast seen. And Cushi bowed himself unto Joab, and
ran.
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C18V22">&nbsp;</a>Then said Ahimaaz the son of Zadok yet again to Joab, But howsoever, let me, I pray thee, also run after
Cushi. And Joab said, Wherefore wilt thou run, my son, seeing that thou hast no tidings ready?
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C18V23">&nbsp;</a>But howsoever,
<span class="add">said he,</span> let me run. And he said unto him, Run. Then Ahimaaz ran by the way of the plain, and overran Cushi.
 <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C18V24">&nbsp;</a>And David sat between the two gates: and the watchman went up to the roof over the gate unto the wall,
and lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold a man running alone.
 <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C18V25">&nbsp;</a>And the watchman cried, and told the king. And the king said, If he
<span class="add">be</span> alone,
<span class="add">there is</span> tidings in his mouth. And he came apace, and drew near.
 <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C18V26">&nbsp;</a>And the watchman saw another man running: and the watchman called unto the porter, and said, Behold
<span class="add">another</span> man running alone. And the king said, He also bringeth tidings.
 <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C18V27">&nbsp;</a>And the watchman said, Me thinketh the running of the foremost is like the running of Ahimaaz the son
of Zadok. And the king said, He
<span class="add">is</span> a good man, and cometh with good tidings.
 <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C18V28">&nbsp;</a>And Ahimaaz called, and said unto the king, All is well. And he fell down to the earth upon his face
before the king, and said, Blessed
<span class="add">be</span> the LORD thy God, which hath delivered up the men that lifted up their hand against my lord the king.
 <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C18V29">&nbsp;</a>And the king said, Is the young man Absalom safe? And Ahimaaz answered, When Joab sent the king’s servant,
and
<span class="add">me</span> thy servant, I saw a great tumult, but I knew not what
<span class="add">it was.
</span> <span class="verse"> 30</span><a name="C18V30">&nbsp;</a>And the king said
<span class="add">unto him,</span> Turn aside,
<span class="add">and</span> stand here. And he turned aside, and stood still.
 <span class="verse"> 31</span><a name="C18V31">&nbsp;</a>And, behold, Cushi came; and Cushi said, Tidings, my lord the king: for the LORD hath avenged thee this
day of all them that rose up against thee.
 <span class="verse"> 32</span><a name="C18V32">&nbsp;</a>And the king said unto Cushi, Is the young man Absalom safe? And Cushi answered, The enemies of my lord
the king, and all that rise against thee to do
<span class="add">thee</span> hurt, be as
<span class="add">that</span> young man
<span class="add">is.</span></div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 33</span><a name="C18V33">&nbsp;</a>And the king was much moved, and went up to the chamber over the gate, and wept: and as he went, thus
he said, O my son Absalom, my son, my son Absalom! would God I had died for thee, O Absalom, my son,
my son!
