 <span class="verse" id="V1">1&nbsp;</span>And David numbered the people that <span class='add'>were</span> with him, and set captains of thousands and captains of hundreds over them.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span>And David sent forth a third part of the people under the hand of Joab, and a third part under the hand of Abishai the son of Zeruiah, Joab’s brother, and a third part under the hand of Ittai the Gittite. And the king said unto the people, I will surely go forth with you myself also.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>But the people answered, Thou shalt not go forth: for if we flee away, they will not care for us; neither if half of us die, will they care for us: but now <span class='add'>thou art</span> worth ten thousand of us: therefore now <span class='add'>it is</span> better that thou succour us out of the city.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>And the king said unto them, What seemeth you best I will do. And the king stood by the gate side, and all the people came out by hundreds and by thousands.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>And the king commanded Joab and Abishai and Ittai, saying, <span class='add'>Deal</span> gently for my sake with the young man, <span class='add'>even</span> with Absalom. And all the people heard when the king gave all the captains charge concerning Absalom. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>So the people went out into the field against Israel: and the battle was in the wood of Ephraim;  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>Where the people of Israel were slain before the servants of David, and there was there a great slaughter that day of twenty thousand <span class='add'>men</span>.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>For the battle was there scattered over the face of all the country: and the wood devoured more people that day than the sword devoured. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>And Absalom met the servants of David. And Absalom rode upon a mule, and the mule went under the thick boughs of a great oak, and his head caught hold of the oak, and he was taken up between the heaven and the earth; and the mule that <span class='add'>was</span> under him went away.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>And a certain man saw it, and told Joab, and said, Behold, I saw Absalom hanged in an oak.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>And Joab said unto the man that told him, And, behold, thou sawest <span class='add'>him</span>, and why didst thou not smite him there to the ground? and I would have given thee ten <span class='add'>shekels</span> of silver, and a girdle.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>And the man said unto Joab, Though I should receive a thousand <span class='add'>shekels</span> of silver in mine hand, yet would I not put forth mine hand against the king’s son: for in our hearing the king charged thee and Abishai and Ittai, saying, Beware that none <span class='add'>touch</span> the young man Absalom.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>Otherwise I should have wrought falsehood against mine own life: for there is no matter hid from the king, and thou thyself wouldest have set thyself against <span class='add'>me</span>.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>Then said Joab, I may not tarry thus with thee. And he took three darts in his hand, and thrust them through the heart of Absalom, while he <span class='add'>was</span> yet alive in the midst of the oak.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>And ten young men that bare Joab’s armour compassed about and smote Absalom, and slew him.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>And Joab blew the trumpet, and the people returned from pursuing after Israel: for Joab held back the people.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>And they took Absalom, and cast him into a great pit in the wood, and laid a very great heap of stones upon him: and all Israel fled every one to his tent. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>Now Absalom in his lifetime had taken and reared up for himself a pillar, which <span class='add'>is</span> in the king’s dale: for he said, I have no son to keep my name in remembrance: and he called the pillar after his own name: and it is called unto this day, Absalom’s place. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>Then said Ahimaaz the son of Zadok, Let me now run, and bear the king tidings, how that the LORD hath avenged him of his enemies.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>And Joab said unto him, Thou shalt not bear tidings this day, but thou shalt bear tidings another day: but this day thou shalt bear no tidings, because the king’s son is dead.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>Then said Joab to Cushi, Go tell the king what thou hast seen. And Cushi bowed himself unto Joab, and ran.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>Then said Ahimaaz the son of Zadok yet again to Joab, But howsoever, let me, I pray thee, also run after Cushi. And Joab said, Wherefore wilt thou run, my son, seeing that thou hast no tidings ready?  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>But howsoever, <span class='add'>said he</span>, let me run. And he said unto him, Run. Then Ahimaaz ran by the way of the plain, and overran Cushi.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>And David sat between the two gates: and the watchman went up to the roof over the gate unto the wall, and lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold a man running alone.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>And the watchman cried, and told the king. And the king said, If he <span class='add'>be</span> alone, <span class='add'>there is</span> tidings in his mouth. And he came apace, and drew near.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>And the watchman saw another man running: and the watchman called unto the porter, and said, Behold <span class='add'>another</span> man running alone. And the king said, He also bringeth tidings.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>And the watchman said, Me thinketh the running of the foremost is like the running of Ahimaaz the son of Zadok. And the king said, He <span class='add'>is</span> a good man, and cometh with good tidings.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&nbsp;</span>And Ahimaaz called, and said unto the king, All is well. And he fell down to the earth upon his face before the king, and said, Blessed <span class='add'>be</span> the LORD thy God, which hath delivered up the men that lifted up their hand against my lord the king.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&nbsp;</span>And the king said, Is the young man Absalom safe? And Ahimaaz answered, When Joab sent the king’s servant, and <span class='add'>me</span> thy servant, I saw a great tumult, but I knew not what <span class='add'>it was</span>.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&nbsp;</span>And the king said <span class='add'>unto him</span>, Turn aside, <span class='add'>and</span> stand here. And he turned aside, and stood still.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&nbsp;</span>And, behold, Cushi came; and Cushi said, Tidings, my lord the king: for the LORD hath avenged thee this day of all them that rose up against thee.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&nbsp;</span>And the king said unto Cushi, Is the young man Absalom safe? And Cushi answered, The enemies of my lord the king, and all that rise against thee to do <span class='add'>thee</span> hurt, be as <span class='add'>that</span> young man <span class='add'>is</span>. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V33">33&nbsp;</span>And the king was much moved, and went up to the chamber over the gate, and wept: and as he went, thus he said, O my son Absalom, my son, my son Absalom! would God I had died for thee, O Absalom, my son, my son! </div><ul class='tnav'>
