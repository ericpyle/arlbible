 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C6V1">&nbsp;</a>Woe to them
<span class="add">that are</span> at ease in Zion, and trust in the mountain of Samaria,
<span class="add">which are</span> named chief of the nations, to whom the house of Israel came!
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C6V2">&nbsp;</a>Pass ye unto Calneh, and see; and from thence go ye to Hamath the great: then go down to Gath of the
Philistines:
<span class="add">be they</span> better than these kingdoms? or their border greater than your border?
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C6V3">&nbsp;</a>Ye that put far away the evil day, and cause the seat of violence to come near;
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C6V4">&nbsp;</a>That lie upon beds of ivory, and stretch themselves upon their couches, and eat the lambs out of the
flock, and the calves out of the midst of the stall;
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C6V5">&nbsp;</a>That chant to the sound of the viol,
<span class="add">and</span> invent to themselves instruments of musick, like David;
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C6V6">&nbsp;</a>That drink wine in bowls, and anoint themselves with the chief ointments: but they are not grieved for
the affliction of Joseph.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C6V7">&nbsp;</a>Therefore now shall they go captive with the first that go captive, and the banquet of them that stretched
themselves shall be removed.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C6V8">&nbsp;</a>The Lord GOD hath sworn by himself, saith the LORD the God of hosts, I abhor the excellency of Jacob,
and hate his palaces: therefore will I deliver up the city with all that is therein.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C6V9">&nbsp;</a>And it shall come to pass, if there remain ten men in one house, that they shall die.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C6V10">&nbsp;</a>And a man’s uncle shall take him up, and he that burneth him, to bring out the bones out of the house,
and shall say unto him that
<span class="add">is</span> by the sides of the house,
<span class="add">Is there</span> yet
<span class="add">any</span> with thee? and he shall say, No. Then shall he say, Hold thy tongue: for we may not make mention of
the name of the LORD.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C6V11">&nbsp;</a>For, behold, the LORD commandeth, and he will smite the great house with breaches, and the little house
with clefts.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C6V12">&nbsp;</a>Shall horses run upon the rock? will
<span class="add">one</span> plow
<span class="add">there</span> with oxen? for ye have turned judgment into gall, and the fruit of righteousness into hemlock:
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C6V13">&nbsp;</a>Ye which rejoice in a thing of nought, which say, Have we not taken to us horns by our own strength?
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C6V14">&nbsp;</a>But, behold, I will raise up against you a nation, O house of Israel, saith the LORD the God of hosts;
and they shall afflict you from the entering in of Hemath unto the river of the wilderness.
