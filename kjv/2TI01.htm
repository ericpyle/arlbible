<div class="mt1">The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy
</div>
<div class="chapterlabel"> 1</div><div class="p">
 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C1V1">&nbsp;</a>Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, according to the promise of life which is in Christ
Jesus,
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C1V2">&nbsp;</a>To Timothy,
<span class="add">my</span> dearly beloved son: Grace, mercy,
<span class="add">and
</span> peace, from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C1V3">&nbsp;</a>I thank God, whom I serve from
<span class="add">my</span> forefathers with pure conscience, that without ceasing I have remembrance of thee in my prayers night
and day;
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C1V4">&nbsp;</a>Greatly desiring to see thee, being mindful of thy tears, that I may be filled with joy;
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C1V5">&nbsp;</a>When I call to remembrance the unfeigned faith that is in thee, which dwelt first in thy grandmother
Lois, and thy mother Eunice; and I am persuaded that in thee also.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C1V6">&nbsp;</a>Wherefore I put thee in remembrance that thou stir up the gift of God, which is in thee by the putting
on of my hands.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C1V7">&nbsp;</a>For God hath not given us the spirit of fear; but of power, and of love, and of a sound mind.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C1V8">&nbsp;</a>Be not thou therefore ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me his prisoner: but be thou partaker
of the afflictions of the gospel according to the power of God;
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C1V9">&nbsp;</a>Who hath saved us, and called
<span class="add">us</span> with an holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace, which
was given us in Christ Jesus before the world began,
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C1V10">&nbsp;</a>But is now made manifest by the appearing of our Saviour Jesus Christ, who hath abolished death, and
hath brought life and immortality to light through the gospel:
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C1V11">&nbsp;</a>Whereunto I am appointed a preacher, and an apostle, and a teacher of the Gentiles.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C1V12">&nbsp;</a>For the which cause I also suffer these things: nevertheless I am not ashamed: for I know whom I have
believed, and am persuaded that he is able to keep that which I have committed unto him against that
day.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C1V13">&nbsp;</a>Hold fast the form of sound words, which thou hast heard of me, in faith and love which is in Christ
Jesus.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C1V14">&nbsp;</a>That good thing which was committed unto thee keep by the Holy Ghost which dwelleth in us.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C1V15">&nbsp;</a>This thou knowest, that all they which are in Asia be turned away from me; of whom are Phygellus and
Hermogenes.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C1V16">&nbsp;</a>The Lord give mercy unto the house of Onesiphorus; for he oft refreshed me, and was not ashamed of my
chain:
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C1V17">&nbsp;</a>But, when he was in Rome, he sought me out very diligently, and found
<span class="add">me.
</span> <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C1V18">&nbsp;</a>The Lord grant unto him that he may find mercy of the Lord in that day: and in how many things he ministered
unto me at Ephesus, thou knowest very well.
