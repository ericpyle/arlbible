 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C1V1">&nbsp;</a>The words of Nehemiah the son of Hachaliah. And it came to pass in the month Chisleu, in the twentieth
year, as I was in Shushan the palace,
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C1V2">&nbsp;</a>That Hanani, one of my brethren, came, he and
<span class="add">certain</span> men of Judah; and I asked them concerning the Jews that had escaped, which were left of the captivity,
and concerning Jerusalem.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C1V3">&nbsp;</a>And they said unto me, The remnant that are left of the captivity there in the province
<span class="add">are</span> in great affliction and reproach: the wall of Jerusalem also
<span class="add">is</span> broken down, and the gates thereof are burned with fire.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C1V4">&nbsp;</a>And it came to pass, when I heard these words, that I sat down and wept, and mourned
<span class="add">certain</span> days, and fasted, and prayed before the God of heaven,
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C1V5">&nbsp;</a>And said, I beseech thee, O LORD God of heaven, the great and terrible God, that keepeth covenant and
mercy for them that love him and observe his commandments:
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C1V6">&nbsp;</a>Let thine ear now be attentive, and thine eyes open, that thou mayest hear the prayer of thy servant,
which I pray before thee now, day and night, for the children of Israel thy servants, and confess the
sins of the children of Israel, which we have sinned against thee: both I and my father’s house have
sinned.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C1V7">&nbsp;</a>We have dealt very corruptly against thee, and have not kept the commandments, nor the statutes, nor
the judgments, which thou commandedst thy servant Moses.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C1V8">&nbsp;</a>Remember, I beseech thee, the word that thou commandedst thy servant Moses, saying,
<span class="add">If</span> ye transgress, I will scatter you abroad among the nations:
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C1V9">&nbsp;</a>But
<span class="add">if</span> ye turn unto me, and keep my commandments, and do them; though there were of you cast out unto the uttermost
part of the heaven,
<span class="add">yet</span> will I gather them from thence, and will bring them unto the place that I have chosen to set my name
there.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C1V10">&nbsp;</a>Now these
<span class="add">are</span> thy servants and thy people, whom thou hast redeemed by thy great power, and by thy strong hand.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C1V11">&nbsp;</a>O Lord, I beseech thee, let now thine ear be attentive to the prayer of thy servant, and to the prayer
of thy servants, who desire to fear thy name: and prosper, I pray thee, thy servant this day, and grant
him mercy in the sight of this man. For I was the king’s cupbearer.
