 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C3V1">&nbsp;</a>Do we begin again to commend ourselves? or need we, as some
<span class="add">others,
</span> epistles of commendation to you, or
<span class="add">letters</span> of commendation from you?
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C3V2">&nbsp;</a>Ye are our epistle written in our hearts, known and read of all men:
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C3V3">&nbsp;</a><span class="add">Forasmuch as ye are</span> manifestly declared to be the epistle of Christ ministered by us, written not with ink, but with the
Spirit of the living God; not in tables of stone, but in fleshy tables of the heart.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C3V4">&nbsp;</a>And such trust have we through Christ to God-ward:
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C3V5">&nbsp;</a>Not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think any thing as of ourselves; but our sufficiency
<span class="add">is</span> of God;
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C3V6">&nbsp;</a>Who also hath made us able ministers of the new testament; not of the letter, but of the spirit: for
the letter killeth, but the spirit giveth life.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C3V7">&nbsp;</a>But if the ministration of death, written
<span class="add">and</span> engraven in stones, was glorious, so that the children of Israel could not stedfastly behold the face
of Moses for the glory of his countenance; which
<span class="add">glory
</span> was to be done away:
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C3V8">&nbsp;</a>How shall not the ministration of the spirit be rather glorious?
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C3V9">&nbsp;</a>For if the ministration of condemnation
<span class="add">be</span> glory, much more doth the ministration of righteousness exceed in glory.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C3V10">&nbsp;</a>For even that which was made glorious had no glory in this respect, by reason of the glory that excelleth.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C3V11">&nbsp;</a>For if that which is done away
<span class="add">was</span> glorious, much more that which remaineth
<span class="add">is</span> glorious.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C3V12">&nbsp;</a>Seeing then that we have such hope, we use great plainness of speech:
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C3V13">&nbsp;</a>And not as Moses,
<span class="add">which</span> put a vail over his face, that the children of Israel could not stedfastly look to the end of that which
is abolished:
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C3V14">&nbsp;</a>But their minds were blinded: for until this day remaineth the same vail untaken away in the reading
of the old testament; which
<span class="add">vail</span> is done away in Christ.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C3V15">&nbsp;</a>But even unto this day, when Moses is read, the vail is upon their heart.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C3V16">&nbsp;</a>Nevertheless when it shall turn to the Lord, the vail shall be taken away.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C3V17">&nbsp;</a>Now the Lord is that Spirit: and where the Spirit of the Lord
<span class="add">is,</span> there
<span class="add">is</span> liberty.
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C3V18">&nbsp;</a>But we all, with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image
from glory to glory,
<span class="add">even
</span> as by the Spirit of the Lord.
