 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C2V1">&nbsp;</a>Therefore we ought to give the more earnest heed to the things which we have heard, lest at any time
we should let
<span class="add">them</span> slip.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C2V2">&nbsp;</a>For if the word spoken by angels was stedfast, and every transgression and disobedience received a just
recompence of reward;
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C2V3">&nbsp;</a>How shall we escape, if we neglect so great salvation; which at the first began to be spoken by the Lord,
and was confirmed unto us by them that heard
<span class="add">him;
</span> <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C2V4">&nbsp;</a>God also bearing
<span class="add">them</span> witness, both with signs and wonders, and with divers miracles, and gifts of the Holy Ghost, according
to his own will?
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C2V5">&nbsp;</a>For unto the angels hath he not put in subjection the world to come, whereof we speak.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C2V6">&nbsp;</a>But one in a certain place testified, saying, What is man, that thou art mindful of him? or the son of
man, that thou visitest him?
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C2V7">&nbsp;</a>Thou madest him a little lower than the angels; thou crownedst him with glory and honour, and didst set
him over the works of thy hands:
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C2V8">&nbsp;</a>Thou hast put all things in subjection under his feet. For in that he put all in subjection under him,
he left nothing
<span class="add">that is</span> not put under him. But now we see not yet all things put under him.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C2V9">&nbsp;</a>But we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death, crowned with
glory and honour; that he by the grace of God should taste death for every man.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C2V10">&nbsp;</a>For it became him, for whom
<span class="add">are</span> all things, and by whom
<span class="add">are</span> all things, in bringing many sons unto glory, to make the captain of their salvation perfect through
sufferings.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C2V11">&nbsp;</a>For both he that sanctifieth and they who are sanctified
<span class="add">are</span> all of one: for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren,
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C2V12">&nbsp;</a>Saying, I will declare thy name unto my brethren, in the midst of the church will I sing praise unto
thee.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C2V13">&nbsp;</a>And again, I will put my trust in him. And again, Behold I and the children which God hath given me.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C2V14">&nbsp;</a>Forasmuch then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he also himself likewise took part of
the same; that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil;
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C2V15">&nbsp;</a>And deliver them who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C2V16">&nbsp;</a>For verily he took not on
<span class="add">him the nature of</span> angels; but he took on
<span class="add">him</span> the seed of Abraham.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C2V17">&nbsp;</a>Wherefore in all things it behoved him to be made like unto
<span class="add">his</span> brethren, that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in things
<span class="add">pertaining</span> to God, to make reconciliation for the sins of the people.
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C2V18">&nbsp;</a>For in that he himself hath suffered being tempted, he is able to succour them that are tempted.
