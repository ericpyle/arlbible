 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C2V1">&nbsp;</a>But I determined this with myself, that I would not come again to you in heaviness.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C2V2">&nbsp;</a>For if I make you sorry, who is he then that maketh me glad, but the same which is made sorry by me?
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C2V3">&nbsp;</a>And I wrote this same unto you, lest, when I came, I should have sorrow from them of whom I ought to
rejoice; having confidence in you all, that my joy is
<span class="add">the joy</span> of you all.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C2V4">&nbsp;</a>For out of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote unto you with many tears; not that ye should
be grieved, but that ye might know the love which I have more abundantly unto you.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C2V5">&nbsp;</a>But if any have caused grief, he hath not grieved me, but in part: that I may not overcharge you all.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C2V6">&nbsp;</a>Sufficient to such a man is this punishment, which
<span class="add">was inflicted
</span> of many.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C2V7">&nbsp;</a>So that contrariwise ye
<span class="add">ought</span> rather to forgive
<span class="add">him,
</span> and comfort
<span class="add">him,</span> lest perhaps such a one should be swallowed up with overmuch sorrow.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C2V8">&nbsp;</a>Wherefore I beseech you that ye would confirm
<span class="add">your</span> love toward him.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C2V9">&nbsp;</a>For to this end also did I write, that I might know the proof of you, whether ye be obedient in all things.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C2V10">&nbsp;</a>To whom ye forgive any thing, I
<span class="add">forgive</span> also: for if I forgave any thing, to whom I forgave
<span class="add">it,</span> for your sakes
<span class="add">forgave I it
</span> in the person of Christ;
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C2V11">&nbsp;</a>Lest Satan should get an advantage of us: for we are not ignorant of his devices.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C2V12">&nbsp;</a>Furthermore, when I came to Troas to
<span class="add">preach</span> Christ’s gospel, and a door was opened unto me of the Lord,
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C2V13">&nbsp;</a>I had no rest in my spirit, because I found not Titus my brother: but taking my leave of them, I went
from thence into Macedonia.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C2V14">&nbsp;</a>Now thanks
<span class="add">be</span> unto God, which always causeth us to triumph in Christ, and maketh manifest the savour of his knowledge
by us in every place.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C2V15">&nbsp;</a>For we are unto God a sweet savour of Christ, in them that are saved, and in them that perish:
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C2V16">&nbsp;</a>To the one
<span class="add">we are</span> the savour of death unto death; and to the other the savour of life unto life. And who
<span class="add">is</span> sufficient for these things?
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C2V17">&nbsp;</a>For we are not as many, which corrupt the word of God: but as of sincerity, but as of God, in the sight
of God speak we in Christ.
