 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C13V1">&nbsp;</a>Let brotherly love continue.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C13V2">&nbsp;</a>Be not forgetful to entertain strangers: for thereby some have entertained angels unawares.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C13V3">&nbsp;</a>Remember them that are in bonds, as bound with them;
<span class="add">and</span> them which suffer adversity, as being yourselves also in the body.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C13V4">&nbsp;</a>Marriage
<span class="add">is</span> honourable in all, and the bed undefiled: but whoremongers and adulterers God will judge.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C13V5">&nbsp;</a><span class="add">Let your</span> conversation
<span class="add">be</span> without covetousness;
<span class="add">and be</span> content with such things as ye have: for he hath said, I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C13V6">&nbsp;</a>So that we may boldly say, The Lord
<span class="add">is</span> my helper, and I will not fear what man shall do unto me.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C13V7">&nbsp;</a>Remember them which have the rule over you, who have spoken unto you the word of God: whose faith follow,
considering the end of
<span class="add">their</span> conversation.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C13V8">&nbsp;</a>Jesus Christ the same yesterday, and to day, and for ever.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C13V9">&nbsp;</a>Be not carried about with divers and strange doctrines. For
<span class="add">it is</span> a good thing that the heart be established with grace; not with meats, which have not profited them
that have been occupied therein.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C13V10">&nbsp;</a>We have an altar, whereof they have no right to eat which serve the tabernacle.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C13V11">&nbsp;</a>For the bodies of those beasts, whose blood is brought into the sanctuary by the high priest for sin,
are burned without the camp.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C13V12">&nbsp;</a>Wherefore Jesus also, that he might sanctify the people with his own blood, suffered without the gate.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C13V13">&nbsp;</a>Let us go forth therefore unto him without the camp, bearing his reproach.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C13V14">&nbsp;</a>For here have we no continuing city, but we seek one to come.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C13V15">&nbsp;</a>By him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God continually, that is, the fruit of
<span class="add">our</span> lips giving thanks to his name.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C13V16">&nbsp;</a>But to do good and to communicate forget not: for with such sacrifices God is well pleased.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C13V17">&nbsp;</a>Obey them that have the rule over you, and submit yourselves: for they watch for your souls, as they
that must give account, that they may do it with joy, and not with grief: for that
<span class="add">is</span> unprofitable for you.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C13V18">&nbsp;</a>Pray for us: for we trust we have a good conscience, in all things willing to live honestly.
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C13V19">&nbsp;</a>But I beseech
<span class="add">you</span> the rather to do this, that I may be restored to you the sooner.
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C13V20">&nbsp;</a>Now the God of peace, that brought again from the dead our Lord Jesus, that great shepherd of the sheep,
through the blood of the everlasting covenant,
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C13V21">&nbsp;</a>Make you perfect in every good work to do his will, working in you that which is wellpleasing in his
sight, through Jesus Christ; to whom
<span class="add">be</span> glory for ever and ever. Amen.
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C13V22">&nbsp;</a>And I beseech you, brethren, suffer the word of exhortation: for I have written a letter unto you in
few words.
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C13V23">&nbsp;</a>Know ye that
<span class="add">our</span> brother Timothy is set at liberty; with whom, if he come shortly, I will see you.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C13V24">&nbsp;</a>Salute all them that have the rule over you, and all the saints. They of Italy salute you.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C13V25">&nbsp;</a>Grace
<span class="add">be</span> with you all. Amen.
