 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C4V1">&nbsp;</a>Beloved, believe not every spirit, but try the spirits whether they are of God: because many false prophets
are gone out into the world.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C4V2">&nbsp;</a>Hereby know ye the Spirit of God: Every spirit that confesseth that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh
is of God:
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C4V3">&nbsp;</a>And every spirit that confesseth not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is not of God: and this is
that
<span class="add">spirit</span> of antichrist, whereof ye have heard that it should come; and even now already is it in the world.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C4V4">&nbsp;</a>Ye are of God, little children, and have overcome them: because greater is he that is in you, than he
that is in the world.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C4V5">&nbsp;</a>They are of the world: therefore speak they of the world, and the world heareth them.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C4V6">&nbsp;</a>We are of God: he that knoweth God heareth us; he that is not of God heareth not us. Hereby know we the
spirit of truth, and the spirit of error.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C4V7">&nbsp;</a>Beloved, let us love one another: for love is of God; and every one that loveth is born of God, and knoweth
God.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C4V8">&nbsp;</a>He that loveth not knoweth not God; for God is love.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C4V9">&nbsp;</a>In this was manifested the love of God toward us, because that God sent his only begotten Son into the
world, that we might live through him.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C4V10">&nbsp;</a>Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son
<span class="add">to be</span> the propitiation for our sins.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C4V11">&nbsp;</a>Beloved, if God so loved us, we ought also to love one another.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C4V12">&nbsp;</a>No man hath seen God at any time. If we love one another, God dwelleth in us, and his love is perfected
in us.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C4V13">&nbsp;</a>Hereby know we that we dwell in him, and he in us, because he hath given us of his Spirit.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C4V14">&nbsp;</a>And we have seen and do testify that the Father sent the Son
<span class="add">to be</span> the Saviour of the world.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C4V15">&nbsp;</a>Whosoever shall confess that Jesus is the Son of God, God dwelleth in him, and he in God.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C4V16">&nbsp;</a>And we have known and believed the love that God hath to us. God is love; and he that dwelleth in love
dwelleth in God, and God in him.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C4V17">&nbsp;</a>Herein is our love made perfect, that we may have boldness in the day of judgment: because as he is,
so are we in this world.
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C4V18">&nbsp;</a>There is no fear in love; but perfect love casteth out fear: because fear hath torment. He that feareth
is not made perfect in love.
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C4V19">&nbsp;</a>We love him, because he first loved us.
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C4V20">&nbsp;</a>If a man say, I love God, and hateth his brother, he is a liar: for he that loveth not his brother whom
he hath seen, how can he love God whom he hath not seen?
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C4V21">&nbsp;</a>And this commandment have we from him, That he who loveth God love his brother also.
