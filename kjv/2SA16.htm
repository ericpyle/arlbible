 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C16V1">&nbsp;</a>And when David was a little past the top
<span class="add">of the hill,</span> behold, Ziba the servant of Mephibosheth met him, with a couple of asses saddled, and upon them two
hundred
<span class="add">loaves</span> of bread, and an hundred bunches of raisins, and an hundred of summer fruits, and a bottle of wine.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C16V2">&nbsp;</a>And the king said unto Ziba, What meanest thou by these? And Ziba said, The asses
<span class="add">be</span> for the king’s household to ride on; and the bread and summer fruit for the young men to eat; and the
wine, that such as be faint in the wilderness may drink.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C16V3">&nbsp;</a>And the king said, And where
<span class="add">is</span> thy master’s son? And Ziba said unto the king, Behold, he abideth at Jerusalem: for he said, Today shall
the house of Israel restore me the kingdom of my father.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C16V4">&nbsp;</a>Then said the king to Ziba, Behold, thine
<span class="add">are</span> all that
<span class="add">pertained</span> unto Mephibosheth. And Ziba said, I humbly beseech thee
<span class="add">that</span> I may find grace in thy sight, my lord, O king.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C16V5">&nbsp;</a>And when king David came to Bahurim, behold, thence came out a man of the family of the house of Saul,
whose name
<span class="add">was</span> Shimei, the son of Gera: he came forth, and cursed still as he came.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C16V6">&nbsp;</a>And he cast stones at David, and at all the servants of king David: and all the people and all the mighty
men
<span class="add">were</span> on his right hand and on his left.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C16V7">&nbsp;</a>And thus said Shimei when he cursed, Come out, come out, thou bloody man, and thou man of Belial:
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C16V8">&nbsp;</a>The LORD hath returned upon thee all the blood of the house of Saul, in whose stead thou hast reigned;
and the LORD hath delivered the kingdom into the hand of Absalom thy son: and, behold, thou
<span class="add">art taken</span> in thy mischief, because thou
<span class="add">art</span> a bloody man.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C16V9">&nbsp;</a>Then said Abishai the son of Zeruiah unto the king, Why should this dead dog curse my lord the king?
let me go over, I pray thee, and take off his head.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C16V10">&nbsp;</a>And the king said, What have I to do with you, ye sons of Zeruiah? so let him curse, because the LORD
hath said unto him, Curse David. Who shall then say, Wherefore hast thou done so?
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C16V11">&nbsp;</a>And David said to Abishai, and to all his servants, Behold, my son, which came forth of my bowels, seeketh
my life: how much more now
<span class="add">may this</span> Benjamite
<span class="add">do it?</span> let him alone, and let him curse; for the LORD hath bidden him.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C16V12">&nbsp;</a>It may be that the LORD will look on mine affliction, and that the LORD will requite me good for his
cursing this day.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C16V13">&nbsp;</a>And as David and his men went by the way, Shimei went along on the hill’s side over against him, and
cursed as he went, and threw stones at him, and cast dust.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C16V14">&nbsp;</a>And the king, and all the people that
<span class="add">were</span> with him, came weary, and refreshed themselves there.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C16V15">&nbsp;</a>And Absalom, and all the people the men of Israel, came to Jerusalem, and Ahithophel with him.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C16V16">&nbsp;</a>And it came to pass, when Hushai the Archite, David’s friend, was come unto Absalom, that Hushai said
unto Absalom, God save the king, God save the king.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C16V17">&nbsp;</a>And Absalom said to Hushai,
<span class="add">Is</span> this thy kindness to thy friend? why wentest thou not with thy friend?
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C16V18">&nbsp;</a>And Hushai said unto Absalom, Nay; but whom the LORD, and this people, and all the men of Israel, choose,
his will I be, and with him will I abide.
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C16V19">&nbsp;</a>And again, whom should I serve?
<span class="add">should I</span> not
<span class="add">serve
</span> in the presence of his son? as I have served in thy father’s presence, so will I be in thy presence.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C16V20">&nbsp;</a>Then said Absalom to Ahithophel, Give counsel among you what we shall do.
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C16V21">&nbsp;</a>And Ahithophel said unto Absalom, Go in unto thy father’s concubines, which he hath left to keep the
house; and all Israel shall hear that thou art abhorred of thy father: then shall the hands of all that
<span class="add">are</span> with thee be strong.
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C16V22">&nbsp;</a>So they spread Absalom a tent upon the top of the house; and Absalom went in unto his father’s concubines
in the sight of all Israel.
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C16V23">&nbsp;</a>And the counsel of Ahithophel, which he counselled in those days,
<span class="add">was</span> as if a man had enquired at the oracle of God: so
<span class="add">was
</span> all the counsel of Ahithophel both with David and with Absalom.
