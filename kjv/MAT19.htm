 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C19V1">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And it came to pass,
</span><span class="add">that</span><span class="wj"> when Jesus had finished these sayings, he departed from Galilee, and came into the coasts of Judaea
beyond Jordan;
</span> <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C19V2">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And great multitudes followed him; and he healed them there.
</span></div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C19V3">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">The Pharisees also came unto him, tempting him, and saying unto him, Is it lawful for a man to put away
his wife for every cause?
</span> <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C19V4">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And he answered and said unto them, Have ye not read, that he which made
</span><span class="add">them</span><span class="wj"> at the beginning made them male and female,
</span> <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C19V5">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And said, For this cause shall a man leave father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife: and they
twain shall be one flesh?
</span> <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C19V6">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Wherefore they are no more twain, but one flesh. What therefore God hath joined together, let not man
put asunder.
</span> <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C19V7">&nbsp;</a>They say unto him, Why did Moses then command to give a writing of divorcement, and to put her away?
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C19V8">&nbsp;</a>He saith unto them,
<span class="wj">Moses because of the hardness of your hearts suffered you to put away your wives: but from the beginning
it was not so.
</span> <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C19V9">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And I say unto you, Whosoever shall put away his wife, except
</span><span class="add">it be</span><span class="wj"> for fornication, and shall marry another, committeth adultery: and whoso marrieth her which is put away
doth commit adultery.
</span></div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C19V10">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">His disciples say unto him, If the case of the man be so with
</span><span class="add">his</span><span class="wj"> wife, it is not good to marry.
</span> <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C19V11">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">But he said unto them, All
</span><span class="add">men</span><span class="wj"> cannot receive this saying, save
</span><span class="add">they</span><span class="wj"> to whom it is given.
</span> <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C19V12">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">For there are some eunuchs, which were so born from
</span><span class="add">their
</span><span class="wj"> mother’s womb: and there are some eunuchs, which were made eunuchs of men: and there be eunuchs, which
have made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven’s sake. He that is able to receive
</span><span class="add">it,</span><span class="wj"> let him receive
</span><span class="add">it.</span></div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C19V13">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Then were there brought unto him little children, that he should put
</span><span class="add">his</span><span class="wj"> hands on them, and pray: and the disciples rebuked them.
</span> <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C19V14">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">But Jesus said, Suffer little children, and forbid them not, to come unto me: for of such is the kingdom
of heaven.
</span> <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C19V15">&nbsp;</a>And he laid
<span class="add">his</span> hands on them, and departed thence.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C19V16">&nbsp;</a>And, behold, one came and said unto him, Good Master, what good thing shall I do, that I may have eternal
life?
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C19V17">&nbsp;</a>And he said unto him,
<span class="wj">Why callest thou me good?
</span><span class="add">there is
</span><span class="wj"> none good but one,
</span><span class="add">that is,</span><span class="wj"> God: but if thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandments.
</span> <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C19V18">&nbsp;</a>He saith unto him, Which? Jesus said,
<span class="wj">Thou shalt do no murder, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false
witness,
</span> <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C19V19">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Honour thy father and
</span><span class="add">thy</span><span class="wj"> mother: and, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.
</span> <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C19V20">&nbsp;</a>The young man saith unto him, All these things have I kept from my youth up: what lack I yet?
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C19V21">&nbsp;</a>Jesus said unto him,
<span class="wj">If thou wilt be perfect, go
</span><span class="add">and
</span><span class="wj"> sell that thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come
</span><span class="add">and</span><span class="wj"> follow me.
</span> <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C19V22">&nbsp;</a>But when the young man heard that saying, he went away sorrowful: for he had great possessions.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C19V23">&nbsp;</a>Then said Jesus unto his disciples,
<span class="wj">Verily I say unto you, That a rich man shall hardly enter into the kingdom of heaven.
</span> <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C19V24">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And again I say unto you, It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich
man to enter into the kingdom of God.
</span> <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C19V25">&nbsp;</a>When his disciples heard
<span class="add">it,</span> they were exceedingly amazed, saying, Who then can be saved?
 <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C19V26">&nbsp;</a>But Jesus beheld
<span class="add">them,</span> and said unto them,
<span class="wj">With men this is impossible; but with God all things are possible.</span></div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C19V27">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Then answered Peter and said unto him, Behold, we have forsaken all, and followed thee; what shall we
have therefore?
</span> <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C19V28">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And Jesus said unto them, Verily I say unto you, That ye which have followed me, in the regeneration
when the Son of man shall sit in the throne of his glory, ye also shall sit upon twelve thrones, judging
the twelve tribes of Israel.
</span> <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C19V29">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And every one that hath forsaken houses, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children,
or lands, for my name’s sake, shall receive an hundredfold, and shall inherit everlasting life.
</span> <span class="verse"> 30</span><a name="C19V30">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">But many
</span><span class="add">that are</span><span class="wj"> first shall be last; and the last
</span><span class="add">shall be</span><span class="wj"> first.</span></div>
