 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C17V1">&nbsp;</a>Now it came to pass, as David sat in his house, that David said to Nathan the prophet, Lo, I dwell in
an house of cedars, but the ark of the covenant of the LORD
<span class="add">remaineth</span> under curtains.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C17V2">&nbsp;</a>Then Nathan said unto David, Do all that is in thine heart; for God
<span class="add">is</span> with thee.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C17V3">&nbsp;</a>And it came to pass the same night, that the word of God came to Nathan, saying,
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C17V4">&nbsp;</a>Go and tell David my servant, Thus saith the LORD, Thou shalt not build me an house to dwell in:
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C17V5">&nbsp;</a>For I have not dwelt in an house since the day that I brought up Israel unto this day; but have gone
from tent to tent, and from
<span class="add">one</span> tabernacle
<span class="add">to another.
</span> <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C17V6">&nbsp;</a>Wheresoever I have walked with all Israel, spake I a word to any of the judges of Israel, whom I commanded
to feed my people, saying, Why have ye not built me an house of cedars?
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C17V7">&nbsp;</a>Now therefore thus shalt thou say unto my servant David, Thus saith the LORD of hosts, I took thee from
the sheepcote,
<span class="add">even</span> from following the sheep, that thou shouldest be ruler over my people Israel:
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C17V8">&nbsp;</a>And I have been with thee whithersoever thou hast walked, and have cut off all thine enemies from before
thee, and have made thee a name like the name of the great men that
<span class="add">are</span> in the earth.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C17V9">&nbsp;</a>Also I will ordain a place for my people Israel, and will plant them, and they shall dwell in their place,
and shall be moved no more; neither shall the children of wickedness waste them any more, as at the beginning,
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C17V10">&nbsp;</a>And since the time that I commanded judges
<span class="add">to be</span> over my people Israel. Moreover I will subdue all thine enemies. Furthermore I tell thee that the LORD
will build thee an house.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C17V11">&nbsp;</a>And it shall come to pass, when thy days be expired that thou must go
<span class="add">to be</span> with thy fathers, that I will raise up thy seed after thee, which shall be of thy sons; and I will establish
his kingdom.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C17V12">&nbsp;</a>He shall build me an house, and I will stablish his throne for ever.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C17V13">&nbsp;</a>I will be his father, and he shall be my son: and I will not take my mercy away from him, as I took
<span class="add">it</span> from
<span class="add">him</span> that was before thee:
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C17V14">&nbsp;</a>But I will settle him in mine house and in my kingdom for ever: and his throne shall be established for
evermore.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C17V15">&nbsp;</a>According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so did Nathan speak unto David.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C17V16">&nbsp;</a>And David the king came and sat before the LORD, and said, Who
<span class="add">am</span> I, O LORD God, and what
<span class="add">is</span> mine house, that thou hast brought me hitherto?
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C17V17">&nbsp;</a>And
<span class="add">yet</span> this was a small thing in thine eyes, O God; for thou hast
<span class="add">also</span> spoken of thy servant’s house for a great while to come, and hast regarded me according to the estate
of a man of high degree, O LORD God.
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C17V18">&nbsp;</a>What can David
<span class="add">speak</span> more to thee for the honour of thy servant? for thou knowest thy servant.
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C17V19">&nbsp;</a>O LORD, for thy servant’s sake, and according to thine own heart, hast thou done all this greatness,
in making known all these great things.
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C17V20">&nbsp;</a>O LORD,
<span class="add">there is</span> none like thee, neither
<span class="add">is there any</span> God beside thee, according to all that we have heard with our ears.
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C17V21">&nbsp;</a>And what one nation in the earth
<span class="add">is</span> like thy people Israel, whom God went to redeem
<span class="add">to be</span> his own people, to make thee a name of greatness and terribleness, by driving out nations from before
thy people, whom thou hast redeemed out of Egypt?
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C17V22">&nbsp;</a>For thy people Israel didst thou make thine own people for ever; and thou, LORD, becamest their God.
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C17V23">&nbsp;</a>Therefore now, LORD, let the thing that thou hast spoken concerning thy servant and concerning his house
be established for ever, and do as thou hast said.
 <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C17V24">&nbsp;</a>Let it even be established, that thy name may be magnified for ever, saying, The LORD of hosts
<span class="add">is</span> the God of Israel,
<span class="add">even</span> a God to Israel: and
<span class="add">let</span> the house of David thy servant
<span class="add">be</span> established before thee.
 <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C17V25">&nbsp;</a>For thou, O my God, hast told thy servant that thou wilt build him an house: therefore thy servant hath
found
<span class="add">in his heart</span> to pray before thee.
 <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C17V26">&nbsp;</a>And now, LORD, thou art God, and hast promised this goodness unto thy servant:
 <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C17V27">&nbsp;</a>Now therefore let it please thee to bless the house of thy servant, that it may be before thee for ever:
for thou blessest, O LORD, and
<span class="add">it shall be</span> blessed for ever.
