seven days shalt thou eat unleavened bread therewith, <span class='add'>even</span> the bread of affliction; for thou camest forth out of the land of Egypt in haste: that thou mayest remember the day when thou camest forth out of the land of Egypt all the days of thy life.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>And there shall be no leavened bread seen with thee in all thy coast seven days; neither shall there <span class='add'>any thing</span> of the flesh, which thou sacrificedst the first day at even, remain all night until the morning.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>Thou mayest not sacrifice the passover within any of thy gates, which the LORD thy God giveth thee:  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>But at the place which the LORD thy God shall choose to place his name in, there thou shalt sacrifice the passover at even, at the going down of the sun, at the season that thou camest forth out of Egypt.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>And thou shalt roast and eat <span class='add'>it</span> in the place which the LORD thy God shall choose: and thou shalt turn in the morning, and go unto thy tents.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>Six days thou shalt eat unleavened bread: and on the seventh day <span class='add'>shall be</span> a solemn assembly to the LORD thy God: thou shalt do no work <span class='add'>therein</span>. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>Seven weeks shalt thou number unto thee: begin to number the seven weeks from <span class='add'>such time as</span> thou beginnest <span class='add'>to put</span> the sickle to the corn.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>And thou shalt keep the feast of weeks unto the LORD thy God with a tribute of a freewill offering of thine hand, which thou shalt give <span class='add'>unto the LORD thy God</span>, according as the LORD thy God hath blessed thee:  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>And thou shalt rejoice before the LORD thy God, thou, and thy son, and thy daughter, and thy manservant, and thy maidservant, and the Levite that <span class='add'>is</span> within thy gates, and the stranger, and the fatherless, and the widow, that <span class='add'>are</span> among you, in the place which the LORD thy God hath chosen to place his name there.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>And thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in Egypt: and thou shalt observe and do these statutes. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>Thou shalt observe the feast of tabernacles seven days, after that thou hast gathered in thy corn and thy wine:  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>And thou shalt rejoice in thy feast, thou, and thy son, and thy daughter, and thy manservant, and thy maidservant, and the Levite, the stranger, and the fatherless, and the widow, that <span class='add'>are</span> within thy gates.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>Seven days shalt thou keep a solemn feast unto the LORD thy God in the place which the LORD shall choose: because the LORD thy God shall bless thee in all thine increase, and in all the works of thine hands, therefore thou shalt surely rejoice. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>Three times in a year shall all thy males appear before the LORD thy God in the place which he shall choose;
