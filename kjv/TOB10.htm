 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C10V1">&nbsp;</a>Now Tobit his father counted every day: and when the days of the journey were expired, and they came
not,
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C10V2">&nbsp;</a>Then Tobit said, Are they detained? or is Gabael dead, and there is no man to give him the money?
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C10V3">&nbsp;</a>Therefore he was very sorry.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C10V4">&nbsp;</a>Then his wife said unto him, My son is dead, seeing he stayeth long; and she began to wail him, and said,
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C10V5">&nbsp;</a>Now I care for nothing, my son, since I have let thee go, the light of mine eyes.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C10V6">&nbsp;</a>To whom Tobit said, Hold thy peace, take no care, for he is safe.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C10V7">&nbsp;</a>But she said, Hold thy peace, and deceive me not; my son is dead. And she went out every day into the
way which they went, and did eat no meat on the daytime, and ceased not whole nights to bewail her son
Tobias, until the fourteen days of the wedding were expired, which Raguel had sworn that he should spend
there. Then Tobias said to Raguel, Let me go, for my father and my mother look no more to see me.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C10V8">&nbsp;</a>But his father in law said unto him, Tarry with me, and I will send to thy father, and they shall declare
unto him how things go with thee.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C10V9">&nbsp;</a>But Tobias said, No; but let me go to my father.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C10V10">&nbsp;</a>Then Raguel arose, and gave him Sara his wife, and half his goods, servants, and cattle, and money:
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C10V11">&nbsp;</a>And he blessed them, and sent them away, saying, The God of heaven give you a prosperous journey, my
children.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C10V12">&nbsp;</a>And he said to his daughter, Honour thy father and thy mother in law, which are now thy parents, that
I may hear good report of thee. And he kissed her. Edna also said to Tobias, The Lord of heaven restore
thee, my dear brother, and grant that I may see thy children of my daughter Sara before I die, that I
may rejoice before the Lord: behold, I commit my daughter unto thee of special trust; where are do not
entreat her evil.
