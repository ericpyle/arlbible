 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C5V1">&nbsp;</a>Then the prophets, Haggai the prophet, and Zechariah the son of Iddo, prophesied unto the Jews that
<span class="add">were</span> in Judah and Jerusalem in the name of the God of Israel,
<span class="add">even</span> unto them.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C5V2">&nbsp;</a>Then rose up Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and began to build the house
of God which
<span class="add">is</span> at Jerusalem: and with them
<span class="add">were</span> the prophets of God helping them.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C5V3">&nbsp;</a>At the same time came to them Tatnai, governor on this side the river, and Shethar- boznai, and their
companions, and said thus unto them, Who hath commanded you to build this house, and to make up this
wall?
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C5V4">&nbsp;</a>Then said we unto them after this manner, What are the names of the men that make this building?
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C5V5">&nbsp;</a>But the eye of their God was upon the elders of the Jews, that they could not cause them to cease, till
the matter came to Darius: and then they returned answer by letter concerning this
<span class="add">matter.</span></div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C5V6">&nbsp;</a>The copy of the letter that Tatnai, governor on this side the river, and Shethar- boznai, and his companions
the Apharsachites, which
<span class="add">were
</span> on this side the river, sent unto Darius the king:
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C5V7">&nbsp;</a>They sent a letter unto him, wherein was written thus; Unto Darius the king, all peace.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C5V8">&nbsp;</a>Be it known unto the king, that we went into the province of Judea, to the house of the great God, which
is builded with great stones, and timber is laid in the walls, and this work goeth fast on, and prospereth
in their hands.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C5V9">&nbsp;</a>Then asked we those elders,
<span class="add">and</span> said unto them thus, Who commanded you to build this house, and to make up these walls?
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C5V10">&nbsp;</a>We asked their names also, to certify thee, that we might write the names of the men that
<span class="add">were</span> the chief of them.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C5V11">&nbsp;</a>And thus they returned us answer, saying, We are the servants of the God of heaven and earth, and build
the house that was builded these many years ago, which a great king of Israel builded and set up.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C5V12">&nbsp;</a>But after that our fathers had provoked the God of heaven unto wrath, he gave them into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar
the king of Babylon, the Chaldean, who destroyed this house, and carried the people away into Babylon.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C5V13">&nbsp;</a>But in the first year of Cyrus the king of Babylon
<span class="add">the same
</span> king Cyrus made a decree to build this house of God.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C5V14">&nbsp;</a>And the vessels also of gold and silver of the house of God, which Nebuchadnezzar took out of the temple
that
<span class="add">was</span> in Jerusalem, and brought them into the temple of Babylon, those did Cyrus the king take out of the
temple of Babylon, and they were delivered unto
<span class="add">one,</span> whose name
<span class="add">was</span> Sheshbazzar, whom he had made governor;
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C5V15">&nbsp;</a>And said unto him, Take these vessels, go, carry them into the temple that
<span class="add">is</span> in Jerusalem, and let the house of God be builded in his place.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C5V16">&nbsp;</a>Then came the same Sheshbazzar,
<span class="add">and</span> laid the foundation of the house of God which
<span class="add">is</span> in Jerusalem: and since that time even until now hath it been in building, and
<span class="add">yet</span> it is not finished.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C5V17">&nbsp;</a>Now therefore, if
<span class="add">it seem</span> good to the king, let there be search made in the king’s treasure house, which
<span class="add">is</span> there at Babylon, whether it be
<span class="add">so,</span> that a decree was made of Cyrus the king to build this house of God at Jerusalem, and let the king send
his pleasure to us concerning this matter.
