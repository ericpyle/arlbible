<div class="mt1">The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians
</div>
<div class="chapterlabel"> 1</div><div class="p">
 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C1V1">&nbsp;</a>Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, to the saints which are at Ephesus, and to the faithful
in Christ Jesus:
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C1V2">&nbsp;</a>Grace
<span class="add">be</span> to you, and peace, from God our Father, and
<span class="add">from</span> the Lord Jesus Christ.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C1V3">&nbsp;</a>Blessed
<span class="add">be</span> the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly
<span class="add">places</span> in Christ:
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C1V4">&nbsp;</a>According as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and
without blame before him in love:
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C1V5">&nbsp;</a>Having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself, according to the good
pleasure of his will,
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C1V6">&nbsp;</a>To the praise of the glory of his grace, wherein he hath made us accepted in the beloved.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C1V7">&nbsp;</a>In whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of his
grace;
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C1V8">&nbsp;</a>Wherein he hath abounded toward us in all wisdom and prudence;
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C1V9">&nbsp;</a>Having made known unto us the mystery of his will, according to his good pleasure which he hath purposed
in himself:
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C1V10">&nbsp;</a>That in the dispensation of the fulness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ,
both which are in heaven, and which are on earth;
<span class="add">even</span> in him:
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C1V11">&nbsp;</a>In whom also we have obtained an inheritance, being predestinated according to the purpose of him who
worketh all things after the counsel of his own will:
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C1V12">&nbsp;</a>That we should be to the praise of his glory, who first trusted in Christ.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C1V13">&nbsp;</a>In whom ye also
<span class="add">trusted,</span> after that ye heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation: in whom also after that ye believed,
ye were sealed with that holy Spirit of promise,
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C1V14">&nbsp;</a>Which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession, unto the praise
of his glory.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C1V15">&nbsp;</a>Wherefore I also, after I heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus, and love unto all the saints,
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C1V16">&nbsp;</a>Cease not to give thanks for you, making mention of you in my prayers;
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C1V17">&nbsp;</a>That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and
revelation in the knowledge of him:
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C1V18">&nbsp;</a>The eyes of your understanding being enlightened; that ye may know what is the hope of his calling, and
what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints,
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C1V19">&nbsp;</a>And what
<span class="add">is</span> the exceeding greatness of his power to us-ward who believe, according to the working of his mighty
power,
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C1V20">&nbsp;</a>Which he wrought in Christ, when he raised him from the dead, and set
<span class="add">him</span> at his own right hand in the heavenly
<span class="add">places,
</span> <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C1V21">&nbsp;</a>Far above all principality, and power, and might, and dominion, and every name that is named, not only
in this world, but also in that which is to come:
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C1V22">&nbsp;</a>And hath put all
<span class="add">things</span> under his feet, and gave him
<span class="add">to be</span> the head over all
<span class="add">things</span> to the church,
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C1V23">&nbsp;</a>Which is his body, the fulness of him that filleth all in all.
