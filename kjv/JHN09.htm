<div class="chapterlabel"> 9</div><div class="p">
 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C9V1">&nbsp;</a>And as
<span class="add">Jesus</span> passed by, he saw a man which was blind from
<span class="add">his</span> birth.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C9V2">&nbsp;</a>And his disciples asked him, saying, Master, who did sin, this man, or his parents, that he was born
blind?
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C9V3">&nbsp;</a>Jesus answered,
<span class="wj">Neither hath this man sinned, nor his parents: but that the works of God should be made manifest in him.
</span> <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C9V4">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">I must work the works of him that sent me, while it is day: the night cometh, when no man can work.
</span> <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C9V5">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world.
</span> <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C9V6">&nbsp;</a>When he had thus spoken, he spat on the ground, and made clay of the spittle, and he anointed the eyes
of the blind man with the clay,
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C9V7">&nbsp;</a>And said unto him,
<span class="wj">Go, wash in the pool of Siloam,</span> (which is by interpretation, Sent.) He went his way therefore, and washed, and came seeing.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C9V8">&nbsp;</a>The neighbours therefore, and they which before had seen him that he was blind, said, Is not this he
that sat and begged?
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C9V9">&nbsp;</a>Some said, This is he: others
<span class="add">said,</span> He is like him:
<span class="add">but</span> he said, I am
<span class="add">he.
</span> <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C9V10">&nbsp;</a>Therefore said they unto him, How were thine eyes opened?
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C9V11">&nbsp;</a>He answered and said, A man that is called Jesus made clay, and anointed mine eyes, and said unto me,
<span class="wj">Go to the pool of Siloam, and wash:
</span> and I went and washed, and I received sight.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C9V12">&nbsp;</a>Then said they unto him, Where is he? He said, I know not.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C9V13">&nbsp;</a>They brought to the Pharisees him that aforetime was blind.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C9V14">&nbsp;</a>And it was the sabbath day when Jesus made the clay, and opened his eyes.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C9V15">&nbsp;</a>Then again the Pharisees also asked him how he had received his sight. He said unto them, He put clay
upon mine eyes, and I washed, and do see.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C9V16">&nbsp;</a>Therefore said some of the Pharisees, This man is not of God, because he keepeth not the sabbath day.
Others said, How can a man that is a sinner do such miracles? And there was a division among them.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C9V17">&nbsp;</a>They say unto the blind man again, What sayest thou of him, that he hath opened thine eyes? He said,
He is a prophet.
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C9V18">&nbsp;</a>But the Jews did not believe concerning him, that he had been blind, and received his sight, until they
called the parents of him that had received his sight.
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C9V19">&nbsp;</a>And they asked them, saying, Is this your son, who ye say was born blind? how then doth he now see?
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C9V20">&nbsp;</a>His parents answered them and said, We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind:
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C9V21">&nbsp;</a>But by what means he now seeth, we know not; or who hath opened his eyes, we know not: he is of age;
ask him: he shall speak for himself.
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C9V22">&nbsp;</a>These
<span class="add">words</span> spake his parents, because they feared the Jews: for the Jews had agreed already, that if any man did
confess that he was Christ, he should be put out of the synagogue.
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C9V23">&nbsp;</a>Therefore said his parents, He is of age; ask him.
 <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C9V24">&nbsp;</a>Then again called they the man that was blind, and said unto him, Give God the praise: we know that this
man is a sinner.
 <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C9V25">&nbsp;</a>He answered and said, Whether he be a sinner
<span class="add">or no,</span> I know not: one thing I know, that, whereas I was blind, now I see.
 <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C9V26">&nbsp;</a>Then said they to him again, What did he to thee? how opened he thine eyes?
 <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C9V27">&nbsp;</a>He answered them, I have told you already, and ye did not hear: wherefore would ye hear
<span class="add">it</span> again? will ye also be his disciples?
 <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C9V28">&nbsp;</a>Then they reviled him, and said, Thou art his disciple; but we are Moses’ disciples.
 <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C9V29">&nbsp;</a>We know that God spake unto Moses:
<span class="add">as for</span> this
<span class="add">fellow,</span> we know not from whence he is.
 <span class="verse"> 30</span><a name="C9V30">&nbsp;</a>The man answered and said unto them, Why herein is a marvellous thing, that ye know not from whence he
is, and
<span class="add">yet</span> he hath opened mine eyes.
 <span class="verse"> 31</span><a name="C9V31">&nbsp;</a>Now we know that God heareth not sinners: but if any man be a worshipper of God, and doeth his will,
him he heareth.
 <span class="verse"> 32</span><a name="C9V32">&nbsp;</a>Since the world began was it not heard that any man opened the eyes of one that was born blind.
 <span class="verse"> 33</span><a name="C9V33">&nbsp;</a>If this man were not of God, he could do nothing.
 <span class="verse"> 34</span><a name="C9V34">&nbsp;</a>They answered and said unto him, Thou wast altogether born in sins, and dost thou teach us? And they
cast him out.
 <span class="verse"> 35</span><a name="C9V35">&nbsp;</a>Jesus heard that they had cast him out; and when he had found him, he said unto him,
<span class="wj">Dost thou believe on the Son of God?
</span> <span class="verse"> 36</span><a name="C9V36">&nbsp;</a>He answered and said, Who is he, Lord, that I might believe on him?
 <span class="verse"> 37</span><a name="C9V37">&nbsp;</a>And Jesus said unto him,
<span class="wj">Thou hast both seen him, and it is he that talketh with thee.
</span> <span class="verse"> 38</span><a name="C9V38">&nbsp;</a>And he said, Lord, I believe. And he worshipped him.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 39</span><a name="C9V39">&nbsp;</a>And Jesus said,
<span class="wj">For judgment I am come into this world, that they which see not might see; and that they which see might
be made blind.
</span> <span class="verse"> 40</span><a name="C9V40">&nbsp;</a>And
<span class="add">some</span> of the Pharisees which were with him heard these words, and said unto him, Are we blind also?
 <span class="verse"> 41</span><a name="C9V41">&nbsp;</a>Jesus said unto them,
<span class="wj">If ye were blind, ye should have no sin: but now ye say, We see; therefore your sin remaineth.</span></div>
