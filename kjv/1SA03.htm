 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C3V1">&nbsp;</a>And the child Samuel ministered unto the LORD before Eli. And the word of the LORD was precious in those
days;
<span class="add">there was</span> no open vision.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C3V2">&nbsp;</a>And it came to pass at that time, when Eli
<span class="add">was</span> laid down in his place, and his eyes began to wax dim,
<span class="add">that</span> he could not see;
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C3V3">&nbsp;</a>And ere the lamp of God went out in the temple of the LORD, where the ark of God
<span class="add">was,</span> and Samuel was laid down
<span class="add">to sleep;
</span> <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C3V4">&nbsp;</a>That the LORD called Samuel: and he answered, Here
<span class="add">am</span> I.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C3V5">&nbsp;</a>And he ran unto Eli, and said, Here
<span class="add">am</span> I; for thou calledst me. And he said, I called not; lie down again. And he went and lay down.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C3V6">&nbsp;</a>And the LORD called yet again, Samuel. And Samuel arose and went to Eli, and said, Here
<span class="add">am</span> I; for thou didst call me. And he answered, I called not, my son; lie down again.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C3V7">&nbsp;</a>Now Samuel did not yet know the LORD, neither was the word of the LORD yet revealed unto him.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C3V8">&nbsp;</a>And the LORD called Samuel again the third time. And he arose and went to Eli, and said, Here
<span class="add">am</span> I; for thou didst call me. And Eli perceived that the LORD had called the child.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C3V9">&nbsp;</a>Therefore Eli said unto Samuel, Go, lie down: and it shall be, if he call thee, that thou shalt say,
Speak, LORD; for thy servant heareth. So Samuel went and lay down in his place.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C3V10">&nbsp;</a>And the LORD came, and stood, and called as at other times, Samuel, Samuel. Then Samuel answered, Speak;
for thy servant heareth.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C3V11">&nbsp;</a>And the LORD said to Samuel, Behold, I will do a thing in Israel, at which both the ears of every one
that heareth it shall tingle.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C3V12">&nbsp;</a>In that day I will perform against Eli all
<span class="add">things</span> which I have spoken concerning his house: when I begin, I will also make an end.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C3V13">&nbsp;</a>For I have told him that I will judge his house for ever for the iniquity which he knoweth; because his
sons made themselves vile, and he restrained them not.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C3V14">&nbsp;</a>And therefore I have sworn unto the house of Eli, that the iniquity of Eli’s house shall not be purged
with sacrifice nor offering for ever.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C3V15">&nbsp;</a>And Samuel lay until the morning, and opened the doors of the house of the LORD. And Samuel feared to
shew Eli the vision.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C3V16">&nbsp;</a>Then Eli called Samuel, and said, Samuel, my son. And he answered, Here
<span class="add">am</span> I.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C3V17">&nbsp;</a>And he said, What
<span class="add">is</span> the thing that
<span class="add">the LORD</span> hath said unto thee? I pray thee hide
<span class="add">it</span> not from me: God do so to thee, and more also, if thou hide
<span class="add">any</span> thing from me of all the things that he said unto thee.
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C3V18">&nbsp;</a>And Samuel told him every whit, and hid nothing from him. And he said, It
<span class="add">is</span> the LORD: let him do what seemeth him good.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C3V19">&nbsp;</a>And Samuel grew, and the LORD was with him, and did let none of his words fall to the ground.
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C3V20">&nbsp;</a>And all Israel from Dan even to Beer-sheba knew that Samuel
<span class="add">was</span> established
<span class="add">to be</span> a prophet of the LORD.
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C3V21">&nbsp;</a>And the LORD appeared again in Shiloh: for the LORD revealed himself to Samuel in Shiloh by the word
of the LORD.
