 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C21V1">&nbsp;</a>If
<span class="add">one</span> be found slain in the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee to possess it, lying in the field,
<span class="add">and</span> it be not known who hath slain him:
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C21V2">&nbsp;</a>Then thy elders and thy judges shall come forth, and they shall measure unto the cities which
<span class="add">are</span> round about him that is slain:
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C21V3">&nbsp;</a>And it shall be,
<span class="add">that</span> the city
<span class="add">which is</span> next unto the slain man, even the elders of that city shall take an heifer, which hath not been wrought
with,
<span class="add">and</span> which hath not drawn in the yoke;
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C21V4">&nbsp;</a>And the elders of that city shall bring down the heifer unto a rough valley, which is neither eared nor
sown, and shall strike off the heifer’s neck there in the valley:
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C21V5">&nbsp;</a>And the priests the sons of Levi shall come near; for them the LORD thy God hath chosen to minister unto
him, and to bless in the name of the LORD; and by their word shall every controversy and every stroke
be
<span class="add">tried:
</span> <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C21V6">&nbsp;</a>And all the elders of that city,
<span class="add">that are</span> next unto the slain
<span class="add">man,</span> shall wash their hands over the heifer that is beheaded in the valley:
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C21V7">&nbsp;</a>And they shall answer and say, Our hands have not shed this blood, neither have our eyes seen
<span class="add">it.
</span> <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C21V8">&nbsp;</a>Be merciful, O LORD, unto thy people Israel, whom thou hast redeemed, and lay not innocent blood unto
thy people of Israel’s charge. And the blood shall be forgiven them.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C21V9">&nbsp;</a>So shalt thou put away the
<span class="add">guilt of</span> innocent blood from among you, when thou shalt do
<span class="add">that which is</span> right in the sight of the LORD.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C21V10">&nbsp;</a>When thou goest forth to war against thine enemies, and the LORD thy God hath delivered them into thine
hands, and thou hast taken them captive,
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C21V11">&nbsp;</a>And seest among the captives a beautiful woman, and hast a desire unto her, that thou wouldest have her
to thy wife;
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C21V12">&nbsp;</a>Then thou shalt bring her home to thine house; and she shall shave her head, and pare her nails;
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C21V13">&nbsp;</a>And she shall put the raiment of her captivity from off her, and shall remain in thine house, and bewail
her father and her mother a full month: and after that thou shalt go in unto her, and be her husband,
and she shall be thy wife.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C21V14">&nbsp;</a>And it shall be, if thou have no delight in her, then thou shalt let her go whither she will; but thou
shalt not sell her at all for money, thou shalt not make merchandise of her, because thou hast humbled
her.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C21V15">&nbsp;</a>If a man have two wives, one beloved, and another hated, and they have born him children,
<span class="add">both</span> the beloved and the hated; and if the firstborn son be hers that was hated:
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C21V16">&nbsp;</a>Then it shall be, when he maketh his sons to inherit
<span class="add">that</span> which he hath,
<span class="add">that</span> he may not make the son of the beloved firstborn before the son of the hated,
<span class="add">which is indeed</span> the firstborn:
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C21V17">&nbsp;</a>But he shall acknowledge the son of the hated
<span class="add">for</span> the firstborn, by giving him a double portion of all that he hath: for he
<span class="add">is</span> the beginning of his strength; the right of the firstborn
<span class="add">is</span> his.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C21V18">&nbsp;</a>If a man have a stubborn and rebellious son, which will not obey the voice of his father, or the voice
of his mother, and
<span class="add">that,</span> when they have chastened him, will not hearken unto them:
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C21V19">&nbsp;</a>Then shall his father and his mother lay hold on him, and bring him out unto the elders of his city,
and unto the gate of his place;
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C21V20">&nbsp;</a>And they shall say unto the elders of his city, This our son
<span class="add">is</span> stubborn and rebellious, he will not obey our voice;
<span class="add">he is</span> a glutton, and a drunkard.
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C21V21">&nbsp;</a>And all the men of his city shall stone him with stones, that he die: so shalt thou put evil away from
among you; and all Israel shall hear, and fear.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C21V22">&nbsp;</a>And if a man have committed a sin worthy of death, and he be to be put to death, and thou hang him on
a tree:
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C21V23">&nbsp;</a>His body shall not remain all night upon the tree, but thou shalt in any wise bury him that day; (for
he that is hanged
<span class="add">is</span> accursed of God;) that thy land be not defiled, which the LORD thy God giveth thee
<span class="add">for</span> an inheritance.
