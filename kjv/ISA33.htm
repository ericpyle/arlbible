Who among us shall dwell with the devouring fire? who among us shall dwell with everlasting burnings?  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>He that walketh righteously, and speaketh uprightly; he that despiseth the gain of oppressions, that shaketh his hands from holding of bribes, that stoppeth his ears from hearing of blood, and shutteth his eyes from seeing evil;  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>He shall dwell on high: his place of defence <span class='add'>shall be</span> the munitions of rocks: bread shall be given him; his waters <span class='add'>shall be</span> sure.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>Thine eyes shall see the king in his beauty: they shall behold the land that is very far off.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>Thine heart shall meditate terror.
