 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C25V1">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Then shall the kingdom of heaven be likened unto ten virgins, which took their lamps, and went forth
to meet the bridegroom.
</span> <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C25V2">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And five of them were wise, and five
</span><span class="add">were</span><span class="wj"> foolish.
</span> <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C25V3">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">They that
</span><span class="add">were</span><span class="wj"> foolish took their lamps, and took no oil with them:
</span> <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C25V4">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">But the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps.
</span> <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C25V5">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">While the bridegroom tarried, they all slumbered and slept.
</span> <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C25V6">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And at midnight there was a cry made, Behold, the bridegroom cometh; go ye out to meet him.
</span> <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C25V7">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Then all those virgins arose, and trimmed their lamps.
</span> <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C25V8">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And the foolish said unto the wise, Give us of your oil; for our lamps are gone out.
</span> <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C25V9">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">But the wise answered, saying,
</span><span class="add">Not so;</span><span class="wj"> lest there be not enough for us and you: but go ye rather to them that sell, and buy for yourselves.
</span> <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C25V10">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And while they went to buy, the bridegroom came; and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage:
and the door was shut.
</span> <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C25V11">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Afterward came also the other virgins, saying, Lord, Lord, open to us.
</span> <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C25V12">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">But he answered and said, Verily I say unto you, I know you not.
</span> <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C25V13">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Watch therefore, for ye know neither the day nor the hour wherein the Son of man cometh.</span></div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C25V14">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">For
</span><span class="add">the kingdom of heaven is</span><span class="wj"> as a man travelling into a far country,
</span><span class="add">who</span><span class="wj"> called his own servants, and delivered unto them his goods.
</span> <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C25V15">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And unto one he gave five talents, to another two, and to another one; to every man according to his
several ability; and straightway took his journey.
</span> <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C25V16">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Then he that had received the five talents went and traded with the same, and made
</span><span class="add">them</span><span class="wj"> other five talents.
</span> <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C25V17">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And likewise he that
</span><span class="add">had received</span><span class="wj"> two, he also gained other two.
</span> <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C25V18">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">But he that had received one went and digged in the earth, and hid his lord’s money.
</span> <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C25V19">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">After a long time the lord of those servants cometh, and reckoneth with them.
</span> <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C25V20">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And so he that had received five talents came and brought other five talents, saying, Lord, thou deliveredst
unto me five talents: behold, I have gained beside them five talents more.
</span> <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C25V21">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">His lord said unto him, Well done,
</span><span class="add">thou</span><span class="wj"> good and faithful servant: thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many
things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord.
</span> <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C25V22">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">He also that had received two talents came and said, Lord, thou deliveredst unto me two talents: behold,
I have gained two other talents beside them.
</span> <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C25V23">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">His lord said unto him, Well done, good and faithful servant; thou hast been faithful over a few things,
I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord.
</span> <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C25V24">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Then he which had received the one talent came and said, Lord, I knew thee that thou art an hard man,
reaping where thou hast not sown, and gathering where thou hast not strawed:
</span> <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C25V25">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And I was afraid, and went and hid thy talent in the earth: lo,
</span><span class="add">there</span><span class="wj"> thou hast
</span><span class="add">that is</span><span class="wj"> thine.
</span> <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C25V26">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">His lord answered and said unto him,
</span><span class="add">Thou</span><span class="wj"> wicked and slothful servant, thou knewest that I reap where I sowed not, and gather where I have not
strawed:
</span> <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C25V27">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Thou oughtest therefore to have put my money to the exchangers, and
</span><span class="add">then</span><span class="wj"> at my coming I should have received mine own with usury.
</span> <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C25V28">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Take therefore the talent from him, and give
</span><span class="add">it</span><span class="wj"> unto him which hath ten talents.
</span> <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C25V29">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">For unto every one that hath shall be given, and he shall have abundance: but from him that hath not
shall be taken away even that which he hath.
</span> <span class="verse"> 30</span><a name="C25V30">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And cast ye the unprofitable servant into outer darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.</span></div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 31</span><a name="C25V31">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">When the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all the holy angels with him, then shall he sit upon
the throne of his glory:
</span> <span class="verse"> 32</span><a name="C25V32">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And before him shall be gathered all nations: and he shall separate them one from another, as a shepherd
divideth
</span><span class="add">his</span><span class="wj"> sheep from the goats:
</span> <span class="verse"> 33</span><a name="C25V33">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And he shall set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on the left.
</span> <span class="verse"> 34</span><a name="C25V34">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Then shall the King say unto them on his right hand, Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom
prepared for you from the foundation of the world:
</span> <span class="verse"> 35</span><a name="C25V35">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">For I was an hungred, and ye gave me meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink: I was a stranger, and
ye took me in:
</span> <span class="verse"> 36</span><a name="C25V36">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Naked, and ye clothed me: I was sick, and ye visited me: I was in prison, and ye came unto me.
</span> <span class="verse"> 37</span><a name="C25V37">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Then shall the righteous answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an hungred, and fed
</span><span class="add">thee?</span><span class="wj"> or thirsty, and gave
</span><span class="add">thee
</span><span class="wj"> drink?
</span> <span class="verse"> 38</span><a name="C25V38">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">When saw we thee a stranger, and took
</span><span class="add">thee</span><span class="wj"> in? or naked, and clothed
</span><span class="add">thee?
</span> <span class="verse"> 39</span><a name="C25V39">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Or when saw we thee sick, or in prison, and came unto thee?
</span> <span class="verse"> 40</span><a name="C25V40">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And the King shall answer and say unto them, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye have done
</span><span class="add">it</span><span class="wj"> unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done
</span><span class="add">it</span><span class="wj"> unto me.
</span> <span class="verse"> 41</span><a name="C25V41">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Then shall he say also unto them on the left hand, Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire,
prepared for the devil and his angels:
</span> <span class="verse"> 42</span><a name="C25V42">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">For I was an hungred, and ye gave me no meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me no drink:
</span> <span class="verse"> 43</span><a name="C25V43">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">I was a stranger, and ye took me not in: naked, and ye clothed me not: sick, and in prison, and ye visited
me not.
</span> <span class="verse"> 44</span><a name="C25V44">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Then shall they also answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an hungred, or athirst, or a stranger,
or naked, or sick, or in prison, and did not minister unto thee?
</span> <span class="verse"> 45</span><a name="C25V45">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Then shall he answer them, saying, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye did
</span><span class="add">it</span><span class="wj"> not to one of the least of these, ye did
</span><span class="add">it</span><span class="wj"> not to me.
</span> <span class="verse"> 46</span><a name="C25V46">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And these shall go away into everlasting punishment: but the righteous into life eternal.</span></div>
