 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C18V1">&nbsp;</a>And it came to pass, when he had made an end of speaking unto Saul, that the soul of Jonathan was knit
with the soul of David, and Jonathan loved him as his own soul.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C18V2">&nbsp;</a>And Saul took him that day, and would let him go no more home to his father’s house.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C18V3">&nbsp;</a>Then Jonathan and David made a covenant, because he loved him as his own soul.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C18V4">&nbsp;</a>And Jonathan stripped himself of the robe that
<span class="add">was</span> upon him, and gave it to David, and his garments, even to his sword, and to his bow, and to his girdle.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C18V5">&nbsp;</a>And David went out whithersoever Saul sent him,
<span class="add">and</span> behaved himself wisely: and Saul set him over the men of war, and he was accepted in the sight of all
the people, and also in the sight of Saul’s servants.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C18V6">&nbsp;</a>And it came to pass as they came, when David was returned from the slaughter of the Philistine, that
the women came out of all cities of Israel, singing and dancing, to meet king Saul, with tabrets, with
joy, and with instruments of musick.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C18V7">&nbsp;</a>And the women answered
<span class="add">one another</span> as they played, and said, Saul hath slain his thousands, and David his ten thousands.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C18V8">&nbsp;</a>And Saul was very wroth, and the saying displeased him; and he said, They have ascribed unto David ten
thousands, and to me they have ascribed
<span class="add">but</span> thousands: and
<span class="add">what</span> can he have more but the kingdom?
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C18V9">&nbsp;</a>And Saul eyed David from that day and forward.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C18V10">&nbsp;</a>And it came to pass on the morrow, that the evil spirit from God came upon Saul, and he prophesied in
the midst of the house: and David played with his hand, as at other times: and
<span class="add">there was</span> a javelin in Saul’s hand.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C18V11">&nbsp;</a>And Saul cast the javelin; for he said, I will smite David even to the wall
<span class="add">with it.</span> And David avoided out of his presence twice.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C18V12">&nbsp;</a>And Saul was afraid of David, because the LORD was with him, and was departed from Saul.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C18V13">&nbsp;</a>Therefore Saul removed him from him, and made him his captain over a thousand; and he went out and came
in before the people.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C18V14">&nbsp;</a>And David behaved himself wisely in all his ways; and the LORD
<span class="add">was</span> with him.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C18V15">&nbsp;</a>Wherefore when Saul saw that he behaved himself very wisely, he was afraid of him.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C18V16">&nbsp;</a>But all Israel and Judah loved David, because he went out and came in before them.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C18V17">&nbsp;</a>And Saul said to David, Behold my elder daughter Merab, her will I give thee to wife: only be thou valiant
for me, and fight the LORD’S battles. For Saul said, Let not mine hand be upon him, but let the hand
of the Philistines be upon him.
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C18V18">&nbsp;</a>And David said unto Saul, Who
<span class="add">am</span> I? and what
<span class="add">is</span> my life,
<span class="add">or</span> my father’s family in Israel, that I should be son in law to the king?
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C18V19">&nbsp;</a>But it came to pass at the time when Merab Saul’s daughter should have been given to David, that she
was given unto Adriel the Meholathite to wife.
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C18V20">&nbsp;</a>And Michal Saul’s daughter loved David: and they told Saul, and the thing pleased him.
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C18V21">&nbsp;</a>And Saul said, I will give him her, that she may be a snare to him, and that the hand of the Philistines
may be against him. Wherefore Saul said to David, Thou shalt this day be my son in law in
<span class="add">the one of</span> the twain.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C18V22">&nbsp;</a>And Saul commanded his servants,
<span class="add">saying,</span> Commune with David secretly, and say, Behold, the king hath delight in thee, and all his servants love
thee: now therefore be the king’s son in law.
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C18V23">&nbsp;</a>And Saul’s servants spake those words in the ears of David. And David said, Seemeth it to you
<span class="add">a</span> light
<span class="add">thing</span> to be a king’s son in law, seeing that I
<span class="add">am</span> a poor man, and lightly esteemed?
 <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C18V24">&nbsp;</a>And the servants of Saul told him, saying, On this manner spake David.
 <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C18V25">&nbsp;</a>And Saul said, Thus shall ye say to David, The king desireth not any dowry, but an hundred foreskins
of the Philistines, to be avenged of the king’s enemies. But Saul thought to make David fall by the hand
of the Philistines.
 <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C18V26">&nbsp;</a>And when his servants told David these words, it pleased David well to be the king’s son in law: and
the days were not expired.
 <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C18V27">&nbsp;</a>Wherefore David arose and went, he and his men, and slew of the Philistines two hundred men; and David
brought their foreskins, and they gave them in full tale to the king, that he might be the king’s son
in law. And Saul gave him Michal his daughter to wife.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C18V28">&nbsp;</a>And Saul saw and knew that the LORD
<span class="add">was</span> with David, and
<span class="add">that</span> Michal Saul’s daughter loved him.
 <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C18V29">&nbsp;</a>And Saul was yet the more afraid of David; and Saul became David’s enemy continually.
 <span class="verse"> 30</span><a name="C18V30">&nbsp;</a>Then the princes of the Philistines went forth: and it came to pass, after they went forth,
<span class="add">that</span> David behaved himself more wisely than all the servants of Saul; so that his name was much set by.
