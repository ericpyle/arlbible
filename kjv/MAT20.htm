 <span class="verse" id="V1">1&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'> For the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man <span class='add'>that is</span> an householder, which went out early in the morning to hire labourers into his vineyard.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'> And when he had agreed with the labourers for a penny a day, he sent them into his vineyard.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'> And he went out about the third hour, and saw others standing idle in the marketplace,</span>  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'> And said unto them; Go ye also into the vineyard, and whatsoever is right I will give you. And they went their way.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'> Again he went out about the sixth and ninth hour, and did likewise.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'> And about the eleventh hour he went out, and found others standing idle, and saith unto them, Why stand ye here all the day idle?</span>  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'> They say unto him, Because no man hath hired us. He saith unto them, Go ye also into the vineyard; and whatsoever is right, <span class='add'>that</span> shall ye receive.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'> So when even was come, the lord of the vineyard saith unto his steward, Call the labourers, and give them <span class='add'>their</span> hire, beginning from the last unto the first.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'> And when they came that <span class='add'>were hired</span> about the eleventh hour, they received every man a penny.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'> But when the first came, they supposed that they should have received more; and they likewise received every man a penny.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'> And when they had received <span class='add'>it</span>, they murmured against the goodman of the house,</span>  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'> Saying, These last have wrought <span class='add'>but</span> one hour, and thou hast made them equal unto us, which have borne the burden and heat of the day.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'> But he answered one of them, and said, Friend, I do thee no wrong: didst not thou agree with me for a penny?</span>  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'> Take <span class='add'>that</span> thine <span class='add'>is</span>, and go thy way: I will give unto this last, even as unto thee.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'> Is it not lawful for me to do what I will with mine own? Is thine eye evil, because I am good?</span>  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'> So the last shall be first, and the first last: for many be called, but few chosen.</span> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>¶ And Jesus going up to Jerusalem took the twelve disciples apart in the way, and said unto them,  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'> Behold, we go up to Jerusalem; and the Son of man shall be betrayed unto the chief priests and unto the scribes, and they shall condemn him to death,</span>  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'> And shall deliver him to the Gentiles to mock, and to scourge, and to crucify <span class='add'>him</span>: and the third day he shall rise again.</span> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>¶ Then came to him the mother of Zebedee’s children with her sons, worshipping <span class='add'>him</span>, and desiring a certain thing of him.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span> And he said unto her, <span class='wj'> What wilt thou?</span> She saith unto him, Grant that these my two sons may sit, the one on thy right hand, and the other on the left, in thy kingdom.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span> But Jesus answered and said, <span class='wj'> Ye know not what ye ask. Are ye able to drink of the cup that I shall drink of, and to be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with?</span> They say unto him, We are able.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span> And he saith unto them, <span class='wj'> Ye shall drink indeed of my cup, and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with: but to sit on my right hand, and on my left, is not mine to give, but <span class='add'>it shall be given to them</span> for whom it is prepared of my Father.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span> And when the ten heard <span class='add'>it</span>, they were moved with indignation against the two brethren.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span> But Jesus called them <span class='add'>unto him</span>, and said, <span class='wj'> Ye know that the princes of the Gentiles exercise dominion over them, and they that are great exercise authority upon them.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'> But it shall not be so among you: but whosoever will be great among you, let him be your minister;</span>  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'> And whosoever will be chief among you, let him be your servant:</span>  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'> Even as the Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&nbsp;</span> And as they departed from Jericho, a great multitude followed him. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V30">30&nbsp;</span>¶ And, behold, two blind men sitting by the way side, when they heard that Jesus passed by, cried out, saying, Have mercy on us, O Lord, <span class='add'>thou</span> Son of David.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&nbsp;</span> And the multitude rebuked them, because they should hold their peace: but they cried the more, saying, Have mercy on us, O Lord, <span class='add'>thou</span> Son of David.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&nbsp;</span> And Jesus stood still, and called them, and said, <span class='wj'> What will ye that I shall do unto you?</span>  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&nbsp;</span> They say unto him, Lord, that our eyes may be opened.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&nbsp;</span> So Jesus had compassion <span class='add'>on them</span>, and touched their eyes: and immediately their eyes received sight, and they followed him. </div><ul class='tnav'>
