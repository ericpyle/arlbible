<div class="chapterlabel"> 3</div><div class="p">
 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C3V1">&nbsp;</a>What advantage then hath the Jew? or what profit
<span class="add">is there</span> of circumcision?
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C3V2">&nbsp;</a>Much every way: chiefly, because that unto them were committed the oracles of God.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C3V3">&nbsp;</a>For what if some did not believe? shall their unbelief make the faith of God without effect?
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C3V4">&nbsp;</a>God forbid: yea, let God be true, but every man a liar; as it is written, That thou mightest be justified
in thy sayings, and mightest overcome when thou art judged.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C3V5">&nbsp;</a>But if our unrighteousness commend the righteousness of God, what shall we say?
<span class="add">Is</span> God unrighteous who taketh vengeance? (I speak as a man)
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C3V6">&nbsp;</a>God forbid: for then how shall God judge the world?
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C3V7">&nbsp;</a>For if the truth of God hath more abounded through my lie unto his glory; why yet am I also judged as
a sinner?
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C3V8">&nbsp;</a>And not
<span class="add">rather,</span> (as we be slanderously reported, and as some affirm that we say,) Let us do evil, that good may come?
whose damnation is just.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C3V9">&nbsp;</a>What then? are we better
<span class="add">than they?</span> No, in no wise: for we have before proved both Jews and Gentiles, that they are all under sin;
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C3V10">&nbsp;</a>As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one:
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C3V11">&nbsp;</a>There is none that understandeth, there is none that seeketh after God.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C3V12">&nbsp;</a>They are all gone out of the way, they are together become unprofitable; there is none that doeth good,
no, not one.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C3V13">&nbsp;</a>Their throat
<span class="add">is</span> an open sepulchre; with their tongues they have used deceit; the poison of asps
<span class="add">is</span> under their lips:
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C3V14">&nbsp;</a>Whose mouth
<span class="add">is</span> full of cursing and bitterness:
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C3V15">&nbsp;</a>Their feet
<span class="add">are</span> swift to shed blood:
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C3V16">&nbsp;</a>Destruction and misery
<span class="add">are</span> in their ways:
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C3V17">&nbsp;</a>And the way of peace have they not known:
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C3V18">&nbsp;</a>There is no fear of God before their eyes.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C3V19">&nbsp;</a>Now we know that what things soever the law saith, it saith to them who are under the law: that every
mouth may be stopped, and all the world may become guilty before God.
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C3V20">&nbsp;</a>Therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight: for by the law
<span class="add">is</span> the knowledge of sin.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C3V21">&nbsp;</a>But now the righteousness of God without the law is manifested, being witnessed by the law and the prophets;
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C3V22">&nbsp;</a>Even the righteousness of God
<span class="add">which is</span> by faith of Jesus Christ unto all and upon all them that believe: for there is no difference:
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C3V23">&nbsp;</a>For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;
 <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C3V24">&nbsp;</a>Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus:
 <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C3V25">&nbsp;</a>Whom God hath set forth
<span class="add">to be</span> a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that
are past, through the forbearance of God;
 <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C3V26">&nbsp;</a>To declare,
<span class="add">I say,</span> at this time his righteousness: that he might be just, and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus.
 <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C3V27">&nbsp;</a>Where
<span class="add">is</span> boasting then? It is excluded. By what law? of works? Nay: but by the law of faith.
 <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C3V28">&nbsp;</a>Therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith without the deeds of the law.
 <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C3V29">&nbsp;</a><span class="add">Is he</span> the God of the Jews only?
<span class="add">is he</span> not also of the Gentiles? Yes, of the Gentiles also:
 <span class="verse"> 30</span><a name="C3V30">&nbsp;</a>Seeing
<span class="add">it is</span> one God, which shall justify the circumcision by faith, and uncircumcision through faith.
 <span class="verse"> 31</span><a name="C3V31">&nbsp;</a>Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid: yea, we establish the law.
