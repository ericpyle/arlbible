 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C3V1">&nbsp;</a>This second epistle, beloved, I now write unto you; in
<span class="add">both</span> which I stir up your pure minds by way of remembrance:
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C3V2">&nbsp;</a>That ye may be mindful of the words which were spoken before by the holy prophets, and of the commandment
of us the apostles of the Lord and Saviour:
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C3V3">&nbsp;</a>Knowing this first, that there shall come in the last days scoffers, walking after their own lusts,
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C3V4">&nbsp;</a>And saying, Where is the promise of his coming? for since the fathers fell asleep, all things continue
as
<span class="add">they were</span> from the beginning of the creation.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C3V5">&nbsp;</a>For this they willingly are ignorant of, that by the word of God the heavens were of old, and the earth
standing out of the water and in the water:
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C3V6">&nbsp;</a>Whereby the world that then was, being overflowed with water, perished:
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C3V7">&nbsp;</a>But the heavens and the earth, which are now, by the same word are kept in store, reserved unto fire
against the day of judgment and perdition of ungodly men.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C3V8">&nbsp;</a>But, beloved, be not ignorant of this one thing, that one day
<span class="add">is</span> with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C3V9">&nbsp;</a>The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness; but is longsuffering to us-ward,
not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C3V10">&nbsp;</a>But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; in the which the heavens shall pass away with
a great noise, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also and the works that are therein
shall be burned up.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C3V11">&nbsp;</a><span class="add">Seeing</span> then
<span class="add">that</span> all these things shall be dissolved, what manner
<span class="add">of persons</span> ought ye to be in
<span class="add">all</span> holy conversation and godliness,
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C3V12">&nbsp;</a>Looking for and hasting unto the coming of the day of God, wherein the heavens being on fire shall be
dissolved, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat?
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C3V13">&nbsp;</a>Nevertheless we, according to his promise, look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C3V14">&nbsp;</a>Wherefore, beloved, seeing that ye look for such things, be diligent that ye may be found of him in peace,
without spot, and blameless.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C3V15">&nbsp;</a>And account
<span class="add">that</span> the longsuffering of our Lord
<span class="add">is</span> salvation; even as our beloved brother Paul also according to the wisdom given unto him hath written
unto you;
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C3V16">&nbsp;</a>As also in all
<span class="add">his</span> epistles, speaking in them of these things; in which are some things hard to be understood, which they
that are unlearned and unstable wrest, as
<span class="add">they do</span> also the other scriptures, unto their own destruction.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C3V17">&nbsp;</a>Ye therefore, beloved, seeing ye know
<span class="add">these things</span> before, beware lest ye also, being led away with the error of the wicked, fall from your own stedfastness.
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C3V18">&nbsp;</a>But grow in grace, and
<span class="add">in</span> the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. To him
<span class="add">be</span> glory both now and for ever. Amen.
