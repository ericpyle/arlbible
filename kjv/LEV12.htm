This <span class='add'>is</span> the law for her that hath born a male or a female.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>And if she be not able to bring a lamb, then she shall bring two turtles, or two young pigeons; the one for the burnt offering, and the other for a sin offering: and the priest shall make an atonement for her, and she shall be clean. </div><ul class='tnav'>
