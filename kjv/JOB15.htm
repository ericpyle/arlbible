 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C15V1">&nbsp;</a>Then answered Eliphaz the Temanite, and said,
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C15V2">&nbsp;</a>Should a wise man utter vain knowledge, and fill his belly with the east wind?
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C15V3">&nbsp;</a>Should he reason with unprofitable talk? or with speeches wherewith he can do no good?
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C15V4">&nbsp;</a>Yea, thou castest off fear, and restrainest prayer before God.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C15V5">&nbsp;</a>For thy mouth uttereth thine iniquity, and thou choosest the tongue of the crafty.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C15V6">&nbsp;</a>Thine own mouth condemneth thee, and not I: yea, thine own lips testify against thee.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C15V7">&nbsp;</a><span class="add">Art</span> thou the first man
<span class="add">that</span> was born? or wast thou made before the hills?
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C15V8">&nbsp;</a>Hast thou heard the secret of God? and dost thou restrain wisdom to thyself?
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C15V9">&nbsp;</a>What knowest thou, that we know not?
<span class="add">what</span> understandest thou, which
<span class="add">is</span> not in us?
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C15V10">&nbsp;</a>With us
<span class="add">are</span> both the grayheaded and very aged men, much elder than thy father.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C15V11">&nbsp;</a><span class="add">Are</span> the consolations of God small with thee? is there any secret thing with thee?
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C15V12">&nbsp;</a>Why doth thine heart carry thee away? and what do thy eyes wink at,
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C15V13">&nbsp;</a>That thou turnest thy spirit against God, and lettest
<span class="add">such
</span> words go out of thy mouth?
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C15V14">&nbsp;</a>What
<span class="add">is</span> man, that he should be clean? and
<span class="add">he which is
</span> born of a woman, that he should be righteous?
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C15V15">&nbsp;</a>Behold, he putteth no trust in his saints; yea, the heavens are not clean in his sight.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C15V16">&nbsp;</a>How much more abominable and filthy
<span class="add">is</span> man, which drinketh iniquity like water?
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C15V17">&nbsp;</a>I will shew thee, hear me; and that
<span class="add">which</span> I have seen I will declare;
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C15V18">&nbsp;</a>Which wise men have told from their fathers, and have not hid
<span class="add">it:
</span> <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C15V19">&nbsp;</a>Unto whom alone the earth was given, and no stranger passed among them.
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C15V20">&nbsp;</a>The wicked man travaileth with pain all
<span class="add">his</span> days, and the number of years is hidden to the oppressor.
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C15V21">&nbsp;</a>A dreadful sound
<span class="add">is</span> in his ears: in prosperity the destroyer shall come upon him.
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C15V22">&nbsp;</a>He believeth not that he shall return out of darkness, and he is waited for of the sword.
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C15V23">&nbsp;</a>He wandereth abroad for bread,
<span class="add">saying,</span> Where
<span class="add">is it?
</span> he knoweth that the day of darkness is ready at his hand.
 <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C15V24">&nbsp;</a>Trouble and anguish shall make him afraid; they shall prevail against him, as a king ready to the battle.
 <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C15V25">&nbsp;</a>For he stretcheth out his hand against God, and strengtheneth himself against the Almighty.
 <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C15V26">&nbsp;</a>He runneth upon him,
<span class="add">even</span> on
<span class="add">his</span> neck, upon the thick bosses of his bucklers:
 <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C15V27">&nbsp;</a>Because he covereth his face with his fatness, and maketh collops of fat on
<span class="add">his</span> flanks.
 <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C15V28">&nbsp;</a>And he dwelleth in desolate cities,
<span class="add">and</span> in houses which no man inhabiteth, which are ready to become heaps.
 <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C15V29">&nbsp;</a>He shall not be rich, neither shall his substance continue, neither shall he prolong the perfection thereof
upon the earth.
 <span class="verse"> 30</span><a name="C15V30">&nbsp;</a>He shall not depart out of darkness; the flame shall dry up his branches, and by the breath of his mouth
shall he go away.
 <span class="verse"> 31</span><a name="C15V31">&nbsp;</a>Let not him that is deceived trust in vanity: for vanity shall be his recompence.
 <span class="verse"> 32</span><a name="C15V32">&nbsp;</a>It shall be accomplished before his time, and his branch shall not be green.
 <span class="verse"> 33</span><a name="C15V33">&nbsp;</a>He shall shake off his unripe grape as the vine, and shall cast off his flower as the olive.
 <span class="verse"> 34</span><a name="C15V34">&nbsp;</a>For the congregation of hypocrites
<span class="add">shall be</span> desolate, and fire shall consume the tabernacles of bribery.
 <span class="verse"> 35</span><a name="C15V35">&nbsp;</a>They conceive mischief, and bring forth vanity, and their belly prepareth deceit.
