 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C15V1">&nbsp;</a>Then came to Jesus scribes and Pharisees, which were of Jerusalem, saying,
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C15V2">&nbsp;</a>Why do thy disciples transgress the tradition of the elders? for they wash not their hands when they
eat bread.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C15V3">&nbsp;</a>But he answered and said unto them,
<span class="wj">Why do ye also transgress the commandment of God by your tradition?
</span> <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C15V4">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">For God commanded, saying, Honour thy father and mother: and, He that curseth father or mother, let him
die the death.
</span> <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C15V5">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">But ye say, Whosoever shall say to
</span><span class="add">his</span><span class="wj"> father or
</span><span class="add">his</span><span class="wj"> mother,
</span><span class="add">It is</span><span class="wj"> a gift, by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me;
</span> <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C15V6">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And honour not his father or his mother,
</span><span class="add">he shall be free.
</span><span class="wj"> Thus have ye made the commandment of God of none effect by your tradition.
</span> <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C15V7">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj"></span><span class="add">Ye</span><span class="wj"> hypocrites, well did Esaias prophesy of you, saying,
</span> <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C15V8">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">This people draweth nigh unto me with their mouth, and honoureth me with
</span><span class="add">their</span><span class="wj"> lips; but their heart is far from me.
</span> <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C15V9">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">But in vain they do worship me, teaching
</span><span class="add">for</span><span class="wj"> doctrines the commandments of men.</span></div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C15V10">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And he called the multitude, and said unto them, Hear, and understand:
</span> <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C15V11">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man; but that which cometh out of the mouth, this defileth
a man.
</span> <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C15V12">&nbsp;</a>Then came his disciples, and said unto him, Knowest thou that the Pharisees were offended, after they
heard this saying?
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C15V13">&nbsp;</a>But he answered and said,
<span class="wj">Every plant, which my heavenly Father hath not planted, shall be rooted up.
</span> <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C15V14">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Let them alone: they be blind leaders of the blind. And if the blind lead the blind, both shall fall
into the ditch.
</span> <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C15V15">&nbsp;</a>Then answered Peter and said unto him, Declare unto us this parable.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C15V16">&nbsp;</a>And Jesus said,
<span class="wj">Are ye also yet without understanding?
</span> <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C15V17">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Do not ye yet understand, that whatsoever entereth in at the mouth goeth into the belly, and is cast
out into the draught?
</span> <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C15V18">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">But those things which proceed out of the mouth come forth from the heart; and they defile the man.
</span> <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C15V19">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">For out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witness,
blasphemies:
</span> <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C15V20">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">These are
</span><span class="add">the things</span><span class="wj"> which defile a man: but to eat with unwashen hands defileth not a man.</span></div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C15V21">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Then Jesus went thence, and departed into the coasts of Tyre and Sidon.
</span> <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C15V22">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And, behold, a woman of Canaan came out of the same coasts, and cried unto him, saying, Have mercy on
me, O Lord,
</span><span class="add">thou</span><span class="wj"> Son of David; my daughter is grievously vexed with a devil.
</span> <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C15V23">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">But he answered her not a word. And his disciples came and besought him, saying, Send her away; for she
crieth after us.
</span> <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C15V24">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">But he answered and said, I am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel.
</span> <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C15V25">&nbsp;</a>Then came she and worshipped him, saying, Lord, help me.
 <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C15V26">&nbsp;</a>But he answered and said,
<span class="wj">It is not meet to take the children’s bread, and to cast
</span><span class="add">it</span><span class="wj"> to dogs.
</span> <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C15V27">&nbsp;</a>And she said, Truth, Lord: yet the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their masters’ table.
 <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C15V28">&nbsp;</a>Then Jesus answered and said unto her,
<span class="wj">O woman, great
</span><span class="add">is
</span><span class="wj"> thy faith: be it unto thee even as thou wilt. And her daughter was made whole from that very hour.
</span> <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C15V29">&nbsp;</a>And Jesus departed from thence, and came nigh unto the sea of Galilee; and went up into a mountain, and
sat down there.
 <span class="verse"> 30</span><a name="C15V30">&nbsp;</a>And great multitudes came unto him, having with them
<span class="add">those that were</span> lame, blind, dumb, maimed, and many others, and cast them down at Jesus’ feet; and he healed them:
 <span class="verse"> 31</span><a name="C15V31">&nbsp;</a>Insomuch that the multitude wondered, when they saw the dumb to speak, the maimed to be whole, the lame
to walk, and the blind to see: and they glorified the God of Israel.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 32</span><a name="C15V32">&nbsp;</a>Then Jesus called his disciples
<span class="add">unto him,</span> and said,
<span class="wj">I have compassion on the multitude, because they continue with me now three days, and have nothing to
eat: and I will not send them away fasting, lest they faint in the way.
</span> <span class="verse"> 33</span><a name="C15V33">&nbsp;</a>And his disciples say unto him, Whence should we have so much bread in the wilderness, as to fill so
great a multitude?
 <span class="verse"> 34</span><a name="C15V34">&nbsp;</a>And Jesus saith unto them,
<span class="wj">How many loaves have ye? And they said, Seven, and a few little fishes.
</span> <span class="verse"> 35</span><a name="C15V35">&nbsp;</a>And he commanded the multitude to sit down on the ground.
 <span class="verse"> 36</span><a name="C15V36">&nbsp;</a>And he took the seven loaves and the fishes, and gave thanks, and brake
<span class="add">them,</span> and gave to his disciples, and the disciples to the multitude.
 <span class="verse"> 37</span><a name="C15V37">&nbsp;</a>And they did all eat, and were filled: and they took up of the broken
<span class="add">meat</span> that was left seven baskets full.
 <span class="verse"> 38</span><a name="C15V38">&nbsp;</a>And they that did eat were four thousand men, beside women and children.
 <span class="verse"> 39</span><a name="C15V39">&nbsp;</a>And he sent away the multitude, and took ship, and came into the coasts of Magdala,
