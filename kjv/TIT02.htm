 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C2V1">&nbsp;</a>But speak thou the things which become sound doctrine:
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C2V2">&nbsp;</a>That the aged men be sober, grave, temperate, sound in faith, in charity, in patience.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C2V3">&nbsp;</a>The aged women likewise, that
<span class="add">they be</span> in behaviour as becometh holiness, not false accusers, not given to much wine, teachers of good things;
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C2V4">&nbsp;</a>That they may teach the young women to be sober, to love their husbands, to love their children,
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C2V5">&nbsp;</a><span class="add">To be</span> discreet, chaste, keepers at home, good, obedient to their own husbands, that the word of God be not
blasphemed.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C2V6">&nbsp;</a>Young men likewise exhort to be sober minded.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C2V7">&nbsp;</a>In all things shewing thyself a pattern of good works: in doctrine
<span class="add">shewing</span> uncorruptness, gravity, sincerity,
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C2V8">&nbsp;</a>Sound speech, that cannot be condemned; that he that is of the contrary part may be ashamed, having no
evil thing to say of you.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C2V9">&nbsp;</a><span class="add">Exhort</span> servants to be obedient unto their own masters,
<span class="add">and</span> to please
<span class="add">them</span> well in all
<span class="add">things;</span> not answering again;
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C2V10">&nbsp;</a>Not purloining, but shewing all good fidelity; that they may adorn the doctrine of God our Saviour in
all things.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C2V11">&nbsp;</a>For the grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men,
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C2V12">&nbsp;</a>Teaching us that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and godly,
in this present world;
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C2V13">&nbsp;</a>Looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ;
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C2V14">&nbsp;</a>Who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify unto himself a peculiar
people, zealous of good works.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C2V15">&nbsp;</a>These things speak, and exhort, and rebuke with all authority. Let no man despise thee.
