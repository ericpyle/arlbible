 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C6V1">&nbsp;</a>What shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin, that grace may abound?
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C6V2">&nbsp;</a>God forbid. How shall we, that are dead to sin, live any longer therein?
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C6V3">&nbsp;</a>Know ye not, that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death?
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C6V4">&nbsp;</a>Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death: that like as Christ was raised up from the dead
by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C6V5">&nbsp;</a>For if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death, we shall be also
<span class="add">in the likeness of his</span> resurrection:
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C6V6">&nbsp;</a>Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with
<span class="add">him,</span> that the body of sin might be destroyed, that henceforth we should not serve sin.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C6V7">&nbsp;</a>For he that is dead is freed from sin.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C6V8">&nbsp;</a>Now if we be dead with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with him:
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C6V9">&nbsp;</a>Knowing that Christ being raised from the dead dieth no more; death hath no more dominion over him.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C6V10">&nbsp;</a>For in that he died, he died unto sin once: but in that he liveth, he liveth unto God.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C6V11">&nbsp;</a>Likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin, but alive unto God through Jesus Christ
our Lord.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C6V12">&nbsp;</a>Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body, that ye should obey it in the lusts thereof.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C6V13">&nbsp;</a>Neither yield ye your members
<span class="add">as</span> instruments of unrighteousness unto sin: but yield yourselves unto God, as those that are alive from
the dead, and your members
<span class="add">as</span> instruments of righteousness unto God.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C6V14">&nbsp;</a>For sin shall not have dominion over you: for ye are not under the law, but under grace.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C6V15">&nbsp;</a>What then? shall we sin, because we are not under the law, but under grace? God forbid.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C6V16">&nbsp;</a>Know ye not, that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey, his servants ye are to whom ye obey;
whether of sin unto death, or of obedience unto righteousness?
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C6V17">&nbsp;</a>But God be thanked, that ye were the servants of sin, but ye have obeyed from the heart that form of
doctrine which was delivered you.
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C6V18">&nbsp;</a>Being then made free from sin, ye became the servants of righteousness.
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C6V19">&nbsp;</a>I speak after the manner of men because of the infirmity of your flesh: for as ye have yielded your members
servants to uncleanness and to iniquity unto iniquity; even so now yield your members servants to righteousness
unto holiness.
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C6V20">&nbsp;</a>For when ye were the servants of sin, ye were free from righteousness.
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C6V21">&nbsp;</a>What fruit had ye then in those things whereof ye are now ashamed? for the end of those things
<span class="add">is</span> death.
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C6V22">&nbsp;</a>But now being made free from sin, and become servants to God, ye have your fruit unto holiness, and the
end everlasting life.
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C6V23">&nbsp;</a>For the wages of sin
<span class="add">is</span> death; but the gift of God
<span class="add">is</span> eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.
