<div class="chapterlabel"> 4</div><div class="p">
 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C4V1">&nbsp;</a>Therefore, my brethren dearly beloved and longed for, my joy and crown, so stand fast in the Lord,
<span class="add">my</span> dearly beloved.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C4V2">&nbsp;</a>I beseech Euodias, and beseech Syntyche, that they be of the same mind in the Lord.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C4V3">&nbsp;</a>And I intreat thee also, true yokefellow, help those women which laboured with me in the gospel, with
Clement also, and
<span class="add">with</span> other my fellowlabourers, whose names
<span class="add">are</span> in the book of life.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C4V4">&nbsp;</a>Rejoice in the Lord alway:
<span class="add">and</span> again I say, Rejoice.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C4V5">&nbsp;</a>Let your moderation be known unto all men. The Lord
<span class="add">is</span> at hand.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C4V6">&nbsp;</a>Be careful for nothing; but in every thing by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests
be made known unto God.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C4V7">&nbsp;</a>And the peace of God, which passeth all understanding, shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ
Jesus.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C4V8">&nbsp;</a>Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things
<span class="add">are</span> honest, whatsoever things
<span class="add">are</span> just, whatsoever things
<span class="add">are</span> pure, whatsoever things
<span class="add">are</span> lovely, whatsoever things
<span class="add">are</span> of good report; if
<span class="add">there be</span> any virtue, and if
<span class="add">there be</span> any praise, think on these things.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C4V9">&nbsp;</a>Those things, which ye have both learned, and received, and heard, and seen in me, do: and the God of
peace shall be with you.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C4V10">&nbsp;</a>But I rejoiced in the Lord greatly, that now at the last your care of me hath flourished again; wherein
ye were also careful, but ye lacked opportunity.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C4V11">&nbsp;</a>Not that I speak in respect of want: for I have learned, in whatsoever state I am,
<span class="add">therewith</span> to be content.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C4V12">&nbsp;</a>I know both how to be abased, and I know how to abound: every where and in all things I am instructed
both to be full and to be hungry, both to abound and to suffer need.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C4V13">&nbsp;</a>I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C4V14">&nbsp;</a>Notwithstanding ye have well done, that ye did communicate with my affliction.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C4V15">&nbsp;</a>Now ye Philippians know also, that in the beginning of the gospel, when I departed from Macedonia, no
church communicated with me as concerning giving and receiving, but ye only.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C4V16">&nbsp;</a>For even in Thessalonica ye sent once and again unto my necessity.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C4V17">&nbsp;</a>Not because I desire a gift: but I desire fruit that may abound to your account.
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C4V18">&nbsp;</a>But I have all, and abound: I am full, having received of Epaphroditus the things
<span class="add">which were sent</span> from you, an odour of a sweet smell, a sacrifice acceptable, wellpleasing to God.
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C4V19">&nbsp;</a>But my God shall supply all your need according to his riches in glory by Christ Jesus.
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C4V20">&nbsp;</a>Now unto God and our Father
<span class="add">be</span> glory for ever and ever. Amen.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C4V21">&nbsp;</a>Salute every saint in Christ Jesus. The brethren which are with me greet you.
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C4V22">&nbsp;</a>All the saints salute you, chiefly they that are of Caesar’s household.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C4V23">&nbsp;</a>The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ
<span class="add">be</span> with you all. Amen.
