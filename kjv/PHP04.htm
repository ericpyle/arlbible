 <span class="verse" id="V1">1&nbsp;</span> Therefore, my brethren dearly beloved and longed for, my joy and crown, so stand fast in the Lord, <span class='add'>my</span> dearly beloved.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span> I beseech Euodias, and beseech Syntyche, that they be of the same mind in the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span> And I intreat thee also, true yokefellow, help those women which laboured with me in the gospel, with Clement also, and <span class='add'>with</span> other my fellowlabourers, whose names <span class='add'>are</span> in the book of life.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span> Rejoice in the Lord alway: <span class='add'>and</span> again I say, Rejoice.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span> Let your moderation be known unto all men. The Lord <span class='add'>is</span> at hand.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span> Be careful for nothing; but in every thing by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span> And the peace of God, which passeth all understanding, shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span> Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things <span class='add'>are</span> honest, whatsoever things <span class='add'>are</span> just, whatsoever things <span class='add'>are</span> pure, whatsoever things <span class='add'>are</span> lovely, whatsoever things <span class='add'>are</span> of good report; if <span class='add'>there be</span> any virtue, and if <span class='add'>there be</span> any praise, think on these things.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span> Those things, which ye have both learned, and received, and heard, and seen in me, do: and the God of peace shall be with you. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span> But I rejoiced in the Lord greatly, that now at the last your care of me hath flourished again; wherein ye were also careful, but ye lacked opportunity.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span> Not that I speak in respect of want: for I have learned, in whatsoever state I am, <span class='add'>therewith</span> to be content.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span> I know both how to be abased, and I know how to abound: every where and in all things I am instructed both to be full and to be hungry, both to abound and to suffer need.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span> I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span> Notwithstanding ye have well done, that ye did communicate with my affliction.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span> Now ye Philippians know also, that in the beginning of the gospel, when I departed from Macedonia, no church communicated with me as concerning giving and receiving, but ye only.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span> For even in Thessalonica ye sent once and again unto my necessity.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span> Not because I desire a gift: but I desire fruit that may abound to your account.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span> But I have all, and abound: I am full, having received of Epaphroditus the things <span class='add'>which were sent</span> from you, an odour of a sweet smell, a sacrifice acceptable, wellpleasing to God.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span> But my God shall supply all your need according to his riches in glory by Christ Jesus.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span> Now unto God and our Father <span class='add'>be</span> glory for ever and ever. Amen. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span> Salute every saint in Christ Jesus. The brethren which are with me greet you.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span> All the saints salute you, chiefly they that are of Caesar’s household.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span> The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ <span class='add'>be</span> with you all.
