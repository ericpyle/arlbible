 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C16V1">&nbsp;</a>Then Judith began to sing this thanksgiving in all Israel, and all the people sang after her this song
of praise.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C16V2">&nbsp;</a>And Judith said, Begin unto my God with timbrels, sing unto my Lord with cymbals: tune unto him a new
psalm: exalt him, and call upon his name.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C16V3">&nbsp;</a>For God breaketh the battles: for among the camps in the midst of the people he hath delivered me out
of the hands of them that persecuted me.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C16V4">&nbsp;</a>Assur came out of the mountains from the north, he came with ten thousands of his army, the multitude
whereof stopped the torrents, and their horsemen have covered the hills.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C16V5">&nbsp;</a>He bragged that he would burn up my borders, and kill my young men with the sword, and dash the sucking
children against the ground, and make mine infants as a prey, and my virgins as a spoil.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C16V6">&nbsp;</a>But the Almighty Lord hath disappointed them by the hand of a woman.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C16V7">&nbsp;</a>For the mighty one did not fall by the young men, neither did the sons of the Titans smite him, nor high
giants set upon him: but Judith the daughter of Merari weakened him with the beauty of her countenance.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C16V8">&nbsp;</a>For she put off the garment of her widowhood for the exaltation of those that were oppressed in Israel,
and anointed her face with ointment, and bound her hair in a tire, and took a linen garment to deceive
him.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C16V9">&nbsp;</a>Her sandals ravished his eyes, her beauty took his mind prisoner, and the fauchion passed through his
neck.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C16V10">&nbsp;</a>The Persians quaked at her boldness, and the Medes were daunted at her hardiness.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C16V11">&nbsp;</a>Then my afflicted shouted for joy, and my weak ones cried aloud; but they were astonished: these lifted
up their voices, but they were overthrown.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C16V12">&nbsp;</a>The sons of the damsels have pierced them through, and wounded them as fugatives’ children: they perished
by the battle of the Lord.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C16V13">&nbsp;</a>I will sing unto the Lord a new song: O Lord, thou art great and glorious, wonderful in strength, and
invincible.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C16V14">&nbsp;</a>Let all creatures serve thee: for thou spakest, and they were made, thou didst send forth thy spirit,
and it created them, and there is none that can resist thy voice.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C16V15">&nbsp;</a>For the mountains shall be moved from their foundations with the waters, the rocks shall melt as wax
at thy presence: yet thou art merciful to them that fear thee.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C16V16">&nbsp;</a>For all sacrifice is too little for a sweet savour unto thee, and all the fat is not sufficient for thy
burnt offering: but he that feareth the Lord is great at all times.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C16V17">&nbsp;</a>Woe to the nations that rise up against my kindred! the Lord Almighty will take vengeance of them in
the day of judgment, in putting fire and worms in their flesh; and they shall feel them, and weep for
ever.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C16V18">&nbsp;</a>Now as soon as they entered into Jerusalem, they worshipped the Lord; and as soon as the people were
purified, they offered their burnt offerings, and their free offerings, and their gifts.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C16V19">&nbsp;</a>Judith also dedicated all the stuff of Holofernes, which the people had given her, and gave the canopy,
which she had taken out of his bedchamber, for a gift unto the Lord.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C16V20">&nbsp;</a>So the people continued feasting in Jerusalem before the sanctuary for the space of three months and
Judith remained with them.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C16V21">&nbsp;</a>After this time every one returned to his own inheritance, and Judith went to Bethulia, and remained
in her own possession, and was in her time honourable in all the country.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C16V22">&nbsp;</a>And many desired her, but none knew her all the days of her life, after that Manasses her husband was
dead, and was gathered to his people.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C16V23">&nbsp;</a>But she increased more and more in honour, and waxed old in her husband’s house, being an hundred and
five years old, and made her maid free; so she died in Bethulia: and they buried her in the cave of her
husband Manasses.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C16V24">&nbsp;</a>And the house of Israel lamented her seven days: and before she died, she did distribute her goods to
all them that were nearest of kindred to Manasses her husband, and to them that were the nearest of her
kindred.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C16V25">&nbsp;</a>And there was none that made the children of Israel any more afraid in the days of Judith, nor a long
time after her death.
