 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C12V1">&nbsp;</a>And the LORD sent Nathan unto David. And he came unto him, and said unto him, There were two men in one
city; the one rich, and the other poor.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C12V2">&nbsp;</a>The rich
<span class="add">man</span> had exceeding many flocks and herds:
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C12V3">&nbsp;</a>But the poor
<span class="add">man</span> had nothing, save one little ewe lamb, which he had bought and nourished up: and it grew up together
with him, and with his children; it did eat of his own meat, and drank of his own cup, and lay in his
bosom, and was unto him as a daughter.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C12V4">&nbsp;</a>And there came a traveller unto the rich man, and he spared to take of his own flock and of his own herd,
to dress for the wayfaring man that was come unto him; but took the poor man’s lamb, and dressed it for
the man that was come to him.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C12V5">&nbsp;</a>And David’s anger was greatly kindled against the man; and he said to Nathan, As the LORD liveth, the
man that hath done this
<span class="add">thing</span> shall surely die:
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C12V6">&nbsp;</a>And he shall restore the lamb fourfold, because he did this thing, and because he had no pity.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C12V7">&nbsp;</a>And Nathan said to David, Thou
<span class="add">art</span> the man. Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, I anointed thee king over Israel, and I delivered thee out
of the hand of Saul;
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C12V8">&nbsp;</a>And I gave thee thy master’s house, and thy master’s wives into thy bosom, and gave thee the house of
Israel and of Judah; and if
<span class="add">that had been</span> too little, I would moreover have given unto thee such and such things.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C12V9">&nbsp;</a>Wherefore hast thou despised the commandment of the LORD, to do evil in his sight? thou hast killed Uriah
the Hittite with the sword, and hast taken his wife
<span class="add">to be</span> thy wife, and hast slain him with the sword of the children of Ammon.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C12V10">&nbsp;</a>Now therefore the sword shall never depart from thine house; because thou hast despised me, and hast
taken the wife of Uriah the Hittite to be thy wife.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C12V11">&nbsp;</a>Thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will raise up evil against thee out of thine own house, and I will take
thy wives before thine eyes, and give
<span class="add">them</span> unto thy neighbour, and he shall lie with thy wives in the sight of this sun.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C12V12">&nbsp;</a>For thou didst
<span class="add">it</span> secretly: but I will do this thing before all Israel, and before the sun.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C12V13">&nbsp;</a>And David said unto Nathan, I have sinned against the LORD. And Nathan said unto David, The LORD also
hath put away thy sin; thou shalt not die.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C12V14">&nbsp;</a>Howbeit, because by this deed thou hast given great occasion to the enemies of the LORD to blaspheme,
the child also
<span class="add">that is</span> born unto thee shall surely die.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C12V15">&nbsp;</a>And Nathan departed unto his house. And the LORD struck the child that Uriah’s wife bare unto David,
and it was very sick.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C12V16">&nbsp;</a>David therefore besought God for the child; and David fasted, and went in, and lay all night upon the
earth.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C12V17">&nbsp;</a>And the elders of his house arose,
<span class="add">and went</span> to him, to raise him up from the earth: but he would not, neither did he eat bread with them.
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C12V18">&nbsp;</a>And it came to pass on the seventh day, that the child died. And the servants of David feared to tell
him that the child was dead: for they said, Behold, while the child was yet alive, we spake unto him,
and he would not hearken unto our voice: how will he then vex himself, if we tell him that the child
is dead?
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C12V19">&nbsp;</a>But when David saw that his servants whispered, David perceived that the child was dead: therefore David
said unto his servants, Is the child dead? And they said, He is dead.
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C12V20">&nbsp;</a>Then David arose from the earth, and washed, and anointed
<span class="add">himself,</span> and changed his apparel, and came into the house of the LORD, and worshipped: then he came to his own
house; and when he required, they set bread before him, and he did eat.
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C12V21">&nbsp;</a>Then said his servants unto him, What thing
<span class="add">is</span> this that thou hast done? thou didst fast and weep for the child,
<span class="add">while it was</span> alive; but when the child was dead, thou didst rise and eat bread.
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C12V22">&nbsp;</a>And he said, While the child was yet alive, I fasted and wept: for I said, Who can tell
<span class="add">whether</span> GOD will be gracious to me, that the child may live?
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C12V23">&nbsp;</a>But now he is dead, wherefore should I fast? can I bring him back again? I shall go to him, but he shall
not return to me.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C12V24">&nbsp;</a>And David comforted Bath-sheba his wife, and went in unto her, and lay with her: and she bare a son,
and he called his name Solomon: and the LORD loved him.
 <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C12V25">&nbsp;</a>And he sent by the hand of Nathan the prophet; and he called his name Jedidiah, because of the LORD.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C12V26">&nbsp;</a>And Joab fought against Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and took the royal city.
 <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C12V27">&nbsp;</a>And Joab sent messengers to David, and said, I have fought against Rabbah, and have taken the city of
waters.
 <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C12V28">&nbsp;</a>Now therefore gather the rest of the people together, and encamp against the city, and take it: lest
I take the city, and it be called after my name.
 <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C12V29">&nbsp;</a>And David gathered all the people together, and went to Rabbah, and fought against it, and took it.
 <span class="verse"> 30</span><a name="C12V30">&nbsp;</a>And he took their king’s crown from off his head, the weight whereof
<span class="add">was</span> a talent of gold with the precious stones: and it was
<span class="add">set</span> on David’s head. And he brought forth the spoil of the city in great abundance.
 <span class="verse"> 31</span><a name="C12V31">&nbsp;</a>And he brought forth the people that
<span class="add">were</span> therein, and put
<span class="add">them</span> under saws, and under harrows of iron, and under axes of iron, and made them pass through the brickkiln:
and thus did he unto all the cities of the children of Ammon. So David and all the people returned unto
Jerusalem.
