<div class="mt1">The Book of Daniel
</div>
<div class="chapterlabel"> 1</div><div class="p">
 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C1V1">&nbsp;</a>In the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah came Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon unto Jerusalem,
and besieged it.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C1V2">&nbsp;</a>And the Lord gave Jehoiakim king of Judah into his hand, with part of the vessels of the house of God:
which he carried into the land of Shinar to the house of his god; and he brought the vessels into the
treasure house of his god.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C1V3">&nbsp;</a>And the king spake unto Ashpenaz the master of his eunuchs, that he should bring
<span class="add">certain</span> of the children of Israel, and of the king’s seed, and of the princes;
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C1V4">&nbsp;</a>Children in whom
<span class="add">was</span> no blemish, but well favoured, and skilful in all wisdom, and cunning in knowledge, and understanding
science, and such as
<span class="add">had</span> ability in them to stand in the king’s palace, and whom they might teach the learning and the tongue
of the Chaldeans.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C1V5">&nbsp;</a>And the king appointed them a daily provision of the king’s meat, and of the wine which he drank: so
nourishing them three years, that at the end thereof they might stand before the king.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C1V6">&nbsp;</a>Now among these were of the children of Judah, Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah:
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C1V7">&nbsp;</a>Unto whom the prince of the eunuchs gave names: for he gave unto Daniel
<span class="add">the name</span> of Belteshazzar; and to Hananiah, of Shadrach; and to Mishael, of Meshach; and to Azariah, of Abed-nego.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C1V8">&nbsp;</a>But Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself with the portion of the king’s meat,
nor with the wine which he drank: therefore he requested of the prince of the eunuchs that he might not
defile himself.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C1V9">&nbsp;</a>Now God had brought Daniel into favour and tender love with the prince of the eunuchs.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C1V10">&nbsp;</a>And the prince of the eunuchs said unto Daniel, I fear my lord the king, who hath appointed your meat
and your drink: for why should he see your faces worse liking than the children which
<span class="add">are</span> of your sort? then shall ye make
<span class="add">me</span> endanger my head to the king.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C1V11">&nbsp;</a>Then said Daniel to Melzar, whom the prince of the eunuchs had set over Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and
Azariah,
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C1V12">&nbsp;</a>Prove thy servants, I beseech thee, ten days; and let them give us pulse to eat, and water to drink.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C1V13">&nbsp;</a>Then let our countenances be looked upon before thee, and the countenance of the children that eat of
the portion of the king’s meat: and as thou seest, deal with thy servants.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C1V14">&nbsp;</a>So he consented to them in this matter, and proved them ten days.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C1V15">&nbsp;</a>And at the end of ten days their countenances appeared fairer and fatter in flesh than all the children
which did eat the portion of the king’s meat.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C1V16">&nbsp;</a>Thus Melzar took away the portion of their meat, and the wine that they should drink; and gave them pulse.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C1V17">&nbsp;</a>As for these four children, God gave them knowledge and skill in all learning and wisdom: and Daniel
had understanding in all visions and dreams.
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C1V18">&nbsp;</a>Now at the end of the days that the king had said he should bring them in, then the prince of the eunuchs
brought them in before Nebuchadnezzar.
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C1V19">&nbsp;</a>And the king communed with them; and among them all was found none like Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and
Azariah: therefore stood they before the king.
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C1V20">&nbsp;</a>And in all matters of wisdom
<span class="add">and</span> understanding, that the king enquired of them, he found them ten times better than all the magicians
<span class="add">and</span> astrologers that
<span class="add">were</span> in all his realm.
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C1V21">&nbsp;</a>And Daniel continued
<span class="add">even</span> unto the first year of king Cyrus.
