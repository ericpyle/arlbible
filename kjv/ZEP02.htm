 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C2V1">&nbsp;</a>Gather yourselves together, yea, gather together, O nation not desired;
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C2V2">&nbsp;</a>Before the decree bring forth,
<span class="add">before</span> the day pass as the chaff, before the fierce anger of the LORD come upon you, before the day of the
LORD’S anger come upon you.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C2V3">&nbsp;</a>Seek ye the LORD, all ye meek of the earth, which have wrought his judgment; seek righteousness, seek
meekness: it may be ye shall be hid in the day of the LORD’S anger.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C2V4">&nbsp;</a>For Gaza shall be forsaken, and Ashkelon a desolation: they shall drive out Ashdod at the noonday, and
Ekron shall be rooted up.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C2V5">&nbsp;</a>Woe unto the inhabitants of the sea coast, the nation of the Cherethites! the word of the LORD
<span class="add">is</span> against you; O Canaan, the land of the Philistines, I will even destroy thee, that there shall be no
inhabitant.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C2V6">&nbsp;</a>And the sea coast shall be dwellings
<span class="add">and</span> cottages for shepherds, and folds for flocks.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C2V7">&nbsp;</a>And the coast shall be for the remnant of the house of Judah; they shall feed thereupon: in the houses
of Ashkelon shall they lie down in the evening: for the LORD their God shall visit them, and turn away
their captivity.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C2V8">&nbsp;</a>I have heard the reproach of Moab, and the revilings of the children of Ammon, whereby they have reproached
my people, and magnified
<span class="add">themselves
</span> against their border.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C2V9">&nbsp;</a>Therefore
<span class="add">as</span> I live, saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, Surely Moab shall be as Sodom, and the children
of Ammon as Gomorrah,
<span class="add">even</span> the breeding of nettles, and saltpits, and a perpetual desolation: the residue of my people shall spoil
them, and the remnant of my people shall possess them.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C2V10">&nbsp;</a>This shall they have for their pride, because they have reproached and magnified
<span class="add">themselves</span> against the people of the LORD of hosts.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C2V11">&nbsp;</a>The LORD
<span class="add">will be</span> terrible unto them: for he will famish all the gods of the earth; and
<span class="add">men</span> shall worship him, every one from his place,
<span class="add">even</span> all the isles of the heathen.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C2V12">&nbsp;</a>Ye Ethiopians also, ye
<span class="add">shall be</span> slain by my sword.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C2V13">&nbsp;</a>And he will stretch out his hand against the north, and destroy Assyria; and will make Nineveh a desolation,
<span class="add">and</span> dry like a wilderness.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C2V14">&nbsp;</a>And flocks shall lie down in the midst of her, all the beasts of the nations: both the cormorant and
the bittern shall lodge in the upper lintels of it;
<span class="add">their</span> voice shall sing in the windows; desolation
<span class="add">shall be</span> in the thresholds: for he shall uncover the cedar work.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C2V15">&nbsp;</a>This
<span class="add">is</span> the rejoicing city that dwelt carelessly, that said in her heart, I
<span class="add">am,</span> and
<span class="add">there is</span> none beside me: how is she become a desolation, a place for beasts to lie down in! every one that passeth
by her shall hiss,
<span class="add">and</span> wag his hand.
