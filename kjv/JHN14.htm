 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C14V1">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Let not your heart be troubled: ye believe in God, believe also in me.
</span> <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C14V2">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">In my Father’s house are many mansions: if
</span><span class="add">it were</span><span class="wj"> not so, I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you.
</span> <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C14V3">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and receive you unto myself; that where I
am,
</span><span class="add">there</span><span class="wj"> ye may be also.
</span> <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C14V4">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And whither I go ye know, and the way ye know.
</span> <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C14V5">&nbsp;</a>Thomas saith unto him, Lord, we know not whither thou goest; and how can we know the way?
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C14V6">&nbsp;</a>Jesus saith unto him,
<span class="wj">I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.
</span> <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C14V7">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">If ye had known me, ye should have known my Father also: and from henceforth ye know him, and have seen
him.
</span> <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C14V8">&nbsp;</a>Philip saith unto him, Lord, shew us the Father, and it sufficeth us.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C14V9">&nbsp;</a>Jesus saith unto him,
<span class="wj">Have I been so long time with you, and yet hast thou not known me, Philip? he that hath seen me hath
seen the Father; and how sayest thou
</span><span class="add">then,</span><span class="wj"> Shew us the Father?
</span> <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C14V10">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Believest thou not that I am in the Father, and the Father in me? the words that I speak unto you I speak
not of myself: but the Father that dwelleth in me, he doeth the works.
</span> <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C14V11">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Believe me that I
</span><span class="add">am</span><span class="wj"> in the Father, and the Father in me: or else believe me for the very works’ sake.
</span> <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C14V12">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me, the works that I do shall he do also; and greater
</span><span class="add">works</span><span class="wj"> than these shall he do; because I go unto my Father.
</span> <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C14V13">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And whatsoever ye shall ask in my name, that will I do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son.
</span> <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C14V14">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">If ye shall ask any thing in my name, I will do
</span><span class="add">it.</span></div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C14V15">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">If ye love me, keep my commandments.
</span> <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C14V16">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever;
</span> <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C14V17">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj"></span><span class="add">Even</span><span class="wj"> the Spirit of truth; whom the world cannot receive, because it seeth him not, neither knoweth him: but
ye know him; for he dwelleth with you, and shall be in you.
</span> <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C14V18">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">I will not leave you comfortless: I will come to you.
</span> <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C14V19">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Yet a little while, and the world seeth me no more; but ye see me: because I live, ye shall live also.
</span> <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C14V20">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">At that day ye shall know that I
</span><span class="add">am</span><span class="wj"> in my Father, and ye in me, and I in you.
</span> <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C14V21">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">He that hath my commandments, and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me: and he that loveth me shall
be loved of my Father, and I will love him, and will manifest myself to him.
</span> <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C14V22">&nbsp;</a>Judas saith unto him, not Iscariot, Lord, how is it that thou wilt manifest thyself unto us, and not
unto the world?
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C14V23">&nbsp;</a>Jesus answered and said unto him,
<span class="wj">If a man love me, he will keep my words: and my Father will love him, and we will come unto him, and
make our abode with him.
</span> <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C14V24">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">He that loveth me not keepeth not my sayings: and the word which ye hear is not mine, but the Father’s
which sent me.
</span> <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C14V25">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">These things have I spoken unto you, being
</span><span class="add">yet</span><span class="wj"> present with you.
</span> <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C14V26">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">But the Comforter,
</span><span class="add">which is</span><span class="wj"> the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all things
to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you.
</span> <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C14V27">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you: not as the world giveth, give I unto you. Let not your
heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid.
</span> <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C14V28">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Ye have heard how I said unto you, I go away, and come
</span><span class="add">again
</span><span class="wj"> unto you. If ye loved me, ye would rejoice, because I said, I go unto the Father: for my Father is greater
than I.
</span> <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C14V29">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And now I have told you before it come to pass, that, when it is come to pass, ye might believe.
</span> <span class="verse"> 30</span><a name="C14V30">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Hereafter I will not talk much with you: for the prince of this world cometh, and hath nothing in me.
</span> <span class="verse"> 31</span><a name="C14V31">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">But that the world may know that I love the Father; and as the Father gave me commandment, even so I
do. Arise, let us go hence.</span></div>
