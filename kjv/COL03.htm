 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C3V1">&nbsp;</a>If ye then be risen with Christ, seek those things which are above, where Christ sitteth on the right
hand of God.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C3V2">&nbsp;</a>Set your affection on things above, not on things on the earth.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C3V3">&nbsp;</a>For ye are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C3V4">&nbsp;</a>When Christ,
<span class="add">who is</span> our life, shall appear, then shall ye also appear with him in glory.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C3V5">&nbsp;</a>Mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth; fornication, uncleanness, inordinate affection,
evil concupiscence, and covetousness, which is idolatry:
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C3V6">&nbsp;</a>For which things’ sake the wrath of God cometh on the children of disobedience:
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C3V7">&nbsp;</a>In the which ye also walked some time, when ye lived in them.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C3V8">&nbsp;</a>But now ye also put off all these; anger, wrath, malice, blasphemy, filthy communication out of your
mouth.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C3V9">&nbsp;</a>Lie not one to another, seeing that ye have put off the old man with his deeds;
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C3V10">&nbsp;</a>And have put on the new
<span class="add">man,</span> which is renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created him:
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C3V11">&nbsp;</a>Where there is neither Greek nor Jew, circumcision nor uncircumcision, Barbarian, Scythian, bond
<span class="add">nor</span> free: but Christ
<span class="add">is</span> all, and in all.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C3V12">&nbsp;</a>Put on therefore, as the elect of God, holy and beloved, bowels of mercies, kindness, humbleness of mind,
meekness, longsuffering;
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C3V13">&nbsp;</a>Forbearing one another, and forgiving one another, if any man have a quarrel against any: even as Christ
forgave you, so also
<span class="add">do</span> ye.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C3V14">&nbsp;</a>And above all these things
<span class="add">put on</span> charity, which is the bond of perfectness.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C3V15">&nbsp;</a>And let the peace of God rule in your hearts, to the which also ye are called in one body; and be ye
thankful.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C3V16">&nbsp;</a>Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom; teaching and admonishing one another in psalms
and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C3V17">&nbsp;</a>And whatsoever ye do in word or deed,
<span class="add">do</span> all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God and the Father by him.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C3V18">&nbsp;</a>Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as it is fit in the Lord.
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C3V19">&nbsp;</a>Husbands, love
<span class="add">your</span> wives, and be not bitter against them.
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C3V20">&nbsp;</a>Children, obey
<span class="add">your</span> parents in all things: for this is well pleasing unto the Lord.
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C3V21">&nbsp;</a>Fathers, provoke not your children
<span class="add">to anger,</span> lest they be discouraged.
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C3V22">&nbsp;</a>Servants, obey in all things
<span class="add">your</span> masters according to the flesh; not with eyeservice, as menpleasers; but in singleness of heart, fearing
God:
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C3V23">&nbsp;</a>And whatsoever ye do, do
<span class="add">it</span> heartily, as to the Lord, and not unto men;
 <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C3V24">&nbsp;</a>Knowing that of the Lord ye shall receive the reward of the inheritance: for ye serve the Lord Christ.
 <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C3V25">&nbsp;</a>But he that doeth wrong shall receive for the wrong which he hath done: and there is no respect of persons.
