 <span class="verse" id="V1">1&nbsp;</span>And Elijah the Tishbite, <span class='add'>who was</span> of the inhabitants of Gilead, said unto Ahab, <span class='add'>As</span> the LORD God of Israel liveth, before whom I stand, there shall not be dew nor rain these years, but according to my word.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span>And the word of the LORD came unto him, saying,  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>Get thee hence, and turn thee eastward, and hide thyself by the brook Cherith, that <span class='add'>is</span> before Jordan.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>And it shall be, <span class='add'>that</span> thou shalt drink of the brook; and I have commanded the ravens to feed thee there.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>So he went and did according unto the word of the LORD: for he went and dwelt by the brook Cherith, that <span class='add'>is</span> before Jordan.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>And the ravens brought him bread and flesh in the morning, and bread and flesh in the evening; and he drank of the brook.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>And it came to pass after a while, that the brook dried up, because there had been no rain in the land. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>And the word of the LORD came unto him, saying,  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>Arise, get thee to Zarephath, which <span class='add'>belongeth</span> to Zidon, and dwell there: behold, I have commanded a widow woman there to sustain thee.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>So he arose and went to Zarephath. And when he came to the gate of the city, behold, the widow woman <span class='add'>was</span> there gathering of sticks: and he called to her, and said, Fetch me, I pray thee, a little water in a vessel, that I may drink.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>And as she was going to fetch <span class='add'>it</span>, he called to her, and said, Bring me, I pray thee, a morsel of bread in thine hand.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>And she said, <span class='add'>As</span> the LORD thy God liveth, I have not a cake, but an handful of meal in a barrel, and a little oil in a cruse: and, behold, I <span class='add'>am</span> gathering two sticks, that I may go in and dress it for me and my son, that we may eat it, and die.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>And Elijah said unto her, Fear not; go <span class='add'>and</span> do as thou hast said: but make me thereof a little cake first, and bring <span class='add'>it</span> unto me, and after make for thee and for thy son.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>For thus saith the LORD God of Israel, The barrel of meal shall not waste, neither shall the cruse of oil fail, until the day <span class='add'>that</span> the LORD sendeth rain upon the earth.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>And she went and did according to the saying of Elijah: and she, and he, and her house, did eat <span class='add'>many</span> days.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span> <span class='add'>And</span> the barrel of meal wasted not, neither did the cruse of oil fail, according to the word of the LORD, which he spake by Elijah. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>And it came to pass after these things, <span class='add'>that</span> the son of the woman, the mistress of the house, fell sick; and his sickness was so sore, that there was no breath left in him.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>And she said unto Elijah, What have I to do with thee, O thou man of God? art thou come unto me to call my sin to remembrance, and to slay my son?  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>And he said unto her, Give me thy son. And he took him out of her bosom, and carried him up into a loft, where he abode, and laid him upon his own bed.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>And he cried unto the LORD, and said, O LORD my God, hast thou also brought evil upon the widow with whom I sojourn, by slaying her son?  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>And he stretched himself upon the child three times, and cried unto the LORD, and said, O LORD my God, I pray thee, let this child’s soul come into him again.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>And the LORD heard the voice of Elijah; and the soul of the child came into him again, and he revived.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>And Elijah took the child, and brought him down out of the chamber into the house, and delivered him unto his mother: and Elijah said, See, thy son liveth. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>And the woman said to Elijah, Now by this I know that thou <span class='add'>art</span> a man of God, <span class='add'>and</span> that the word of the LORD in thy mouth <span class='add'>is</span> truth. </div><ul class='tnav'>
