 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C17V1">&nbsp;</a>And Elijah the Tishbite,
<span class="add">who was</span> of the inhabitants of Gilead, said unto Ahab,
<span class="add">As</span> the LORD God of Israel liveth, before whom I stand, there shall not be dew nor rain these years, but
according to my word.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C17V2">&nbsp;</a>And the word of the LORD came unto him, saying,
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C17V3">&nbsp;</a>Get thee hence, and turn thee eastward, and hide thyself by the brook Cherith, that
<span class="add">is</span> before Jordan.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C17V4">&nbsp;</a>And it shall be,
<span class="add">that</span> thou shalt drink of the brook; and I have commanded the ravens to feed thee there.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C17V5">&nbsp;</a>So he went and did according unto the word of the LORD: for he went and dwelt by the brook Cherith, that
<span class="add">is</span> before Jordan.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C17V6">&nbsp;</a>And the ravens brought him bread and flesh in the morning, and bread and flesh in the evening; and he
drank of the brook.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C17V7">&nbsp;</a>And it came to pass after a while, that the brook dried up, because there had been no rain in the land.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C17V8">&nbsp;</a>And the word of the LORD came unto him, saying,
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C17V9">&nbsp;</a>Arise, get thee to Zarephath, which
<span class="add">belongeth</span> to Zidon, and dwell there: behold, I have commanded a widow woman there to sustain thee.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C17V10">&nbsp;</a>So he arose and went to Zarephath. And when he came to the gate of the city, behold, the widow woman
<span class="add">was</span> there gathering of sticks: and he called to her, and said, Fetch me, I pray thee, a little water in
a vessel, that I may drink.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C17V11">&nbsp;</a>And as she was going to fetch
<span class="add">it,</span> he called to her, and said, Bring me, I pray thee, a morsel of bread in thine hand.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C17V12">&nbsp;</a>And she said,
<span class="add">As</span> the LORD thy God liveth, I have not a cake, but an handful of meal in a barrel, and a little oil in
a cruse: and, behold, I
<span class="add">am</span> gathering two sticks, that I may go in and dress it for me and my son, that we may eat it, and die.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C17V13">&nbsp;</a>And Elijah said unto her, Fear not; go
<span class="add">and</span> do as thou hast said: but make me thereof a little cake first, and bring
<span class="add">it</span> unto me, and after make for thee and for thy son.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C17V14">&nbsp;</a>For thus saith the LORD God of Israel, The barrel of meal shall not waste, neither shall the cruse of
oil fail, until the day
<span class="add">that
</span> the LORD sendeth rain upon the earth.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C17V15">&nbsp;</a>And she went and did according to the saying of Elijah: and she, and he, and her house, did eat
<span class="add">many</span> days.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C17V16">&nbsp;</a><span class="add">And</span> the barrel of meal wasted not, neither did the cruse of oil fail, according to the word of the LORD,
which he spake by Elijah.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C17V17">&nbsp;</a>And it came to pass after these things,
<span class="add">that</span> the son of the woman, the mistress of the house, fell sick; and his sickness was so sore, that there
was no breath left in him.
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C17V18">&nbsp;</a>And she said unto Elijah, What have I to do with thee, O thou man of God? art thou come unto me to call
my sin to remembrance, and to slay my son?
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C17V19">&nbsp;</a>And he said unto her, Give me thy son. And he took him out of her bosom, and carried him up into a loft,
where he abode, and laid him upon his own bed.
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C17V20">&nbsp;</a>And he cried unto the LORD, and said, O LORD my God, hast thou also brought evil upon the widow with
whom I sojourn, by slaying her son?
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C17V21">&nbsp;</a>And he stretched himself upon the child three times, and cried unto the LORD, and said, O LORD my God,
I pray thee, let this child’s soul come into him again.
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C17V22">&nbsp;</a>And the LORD heard the voice of Elijah; and the soul of the child came into him again, and he revived.
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C17V23">&nbsp;</a>And Elijah took the child, and brought him down out of the chamber into the house, and delivered him
unto his mother: and Elijah said, See, thy son liveth.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C17V24">&nbsp;</a>And the woman said to Elijah, Now by this I know that thou
<span class="add">art
</span> a man of God,
<span class="add">and</span> that the word of the LORD in thy mouth
<span class="add">is</span> truth.
