 <span class="verse" id="V1">1&nbsp;</span>The preparations of the heart in man, and the answer of the tongue, <span class='add'>is</span> from the LORD.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span>All the ways of a man <span class='add'>are</span> clean in his own eyes; but the LORD weigheth the spirits.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>Commit thy works unto the LORD, and thy thoughts shall be established.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>The LORD hath made all <span class='add'>things</span> for himself: yea, even the wicked for the day of evil.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>Every one <span class='add'>that is</span> proud in heart <span class='add'>is</span> an abomination to the LORD: <span class='add'>though</span> hand <span class='add'>join</span> in hand, he shall not be unpunished.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>By mercy and truth iniquity is purged: and by the fear of the LORD <span class='add'>men</span> depart from evil.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>When a man’s ways please the LORD, he maketh even his enemies to be at peace with him.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>Better <span class='add'>is</span> a little with righteousness than great revenues without right.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>A man’s heart deviseth his way: but the LORD directeth his steps.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>A divine sentence <span class='add'>is</span> in the lips of the king: his mouth transgresseth not in judgment.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>A just weight and balance <span class='add'>are</span> the LORD’s: all the weights of the bag <span class='add'>are</span> his work.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span> <span class='add'>It is</span> an abomination to kings to commit wickedness: for the throne is established by righteousness.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>Righteous lips <span class='add'>are</span> the delight of kings; and they love him that speaketh right.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>The wrath of a king <span class='add'>is as</span> messengers of death: but a wise man will pacify it.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>In the light of the king’s countenance <span class='add'>is</span> life; and his favour <span class='add'>is</span> as a cloud of the latter rain.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>How much better <span class='add'>is it</span> to get wisdom than gold! and to get understanding rather to be chosen than silver!  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>The highway of the upright <span class='add'>is</span> to depart from evil: he that keepeth his way preserveth his soul.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>Pride <span class='add'>goeth</span> before destruction, and an haughty spirit before a fall.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>Better <span class='add'>it is to be</span> of an humble spirit with the lowly, than to divide the spoil with the proud.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>He that handleth a matter wisely shall find good: and whoso trusteth in the LORD, happy <span class='add'>is</span> he.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>The wise in heart shall be called prudent: and the sweetness of the lips increaseth learning.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>Understanding <span class='add'>is</span> a wellspring of life unto him that hath it: but the instruction of fools <span class='add'>is</span> folly.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>The heart of the wise teacheth his mouth, and addeth learning to his lips.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>Pleasant words <span class='add'>are as</span> an honeycomb, sweet to the soul, and health to the bones.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>There is a way that seemeth right unto a man, but the end thereof <span class='add'>are</span> the ways of death.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>He that laboureth laboureth for himself; for his mouth craveth it of him.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>An ungodly man diggeth up evil: and in his lips <span class='add'>there is</span> as a burning fire.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&nbsp;</span>A froward man soweth strife: and a whisperer separateth chief friends.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&nbsp;</span>A violent man enticeth his neighbour, and leadeth him into the way <span class='add'>that is</span> not good.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&nbsp;</span>He shutteth his eyes to devise froward things: moving his lips he bringeth evil to pass.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&nbsp;</span>The hoary head <span class='add'>is</span> a crown of glory, <span class='add'>if</span> it be found in the way of righteousness.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&nbsp;</span> <span class='add'>He that is</span> slow to anger <span class='add'>is</span> better than the mighty; and he that ruleth his spirit than he that taketh a city.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&nbsp;</span>The lot is cast into the lap; but the whole disposing thereof <span class='add'>is</span> of the LORD. </div><ul class='tnav'>
