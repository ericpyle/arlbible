 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C8V1">&nbsp;</a>Now of the things which we have spoken
<span class="add">this is</span> the sum: We have such an high priest, who is set on the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the
heavens;
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C8V2">&nbsp;</a>A minister of the sanctuary, and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, and not man.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C8V3">&nbsp;</a>For every high priest is ordained to offer gifts and sacrifices: wherefore
<span class="add">it is</span> of necessity that this man have somewhat also to offer.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C8V4">&nbsp;</a>For if he were on earth, he should not be a priest, seeing that there are priests that offer gifts according
to the law:
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C8V5">&nbsp;</a>Who serve unto the example and shadow of heavenly things, as Moses was admonished of God when he was
about to make the tabernacle: for, See, saith he,
<span class="add">that</span> thou make all things according to the pattern shewed to thee in the mount.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C8V6">&nbsp;</a>But now hath he obtained a more excellent ministry, by how much also he is the mediator of a better covenant,
which was established upon better promises.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C8V7">&nbsp;</a>For if that first
<span class="add">covenant</span> had been faultless, then should no place have been sought for the second.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C8V8">&nbsp;</a>For finding fault with them, he saith, Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, when I will make a new
covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah:
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C8V9">&nbsp;</a>Not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day when I took them by the hand
to lead them out of the land of Egypt; because they continued not in my covenant, and I regarded them
not, saith the Lord.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C8V10">&nbsp;</a>For this
<span class="add">is</span> the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, saith the Lord; I will put
my laws into their mind, and write them in their hearts: and I will be to them a God, and they shall
be to me a people:
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C8V11">&nbsp;</a>And they shall not teach every man his neighbour, and every man his brother, saying, Know the Lord: for
all shall know me, from the least to the greatest.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C8V12">&nbsp;</a>For I will be merciful to their unrighteousness, and their sins and their iniquities will I remember
no more.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C8V13">&nbsp;</a>In that he saith, A new
<span class="add">covenant,</span> he hath made the first old. Now that which decayeth and waxeth old
<span class="add">is</span> ready to vanish away.
