 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C6V1">&nbsp;</a>Whither is thy beloved gone, O thou fairest among women? whither is thy beloved turned aside? that we
may seek him with thee.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C6V2">&nbsp;</a>My beloved is gone down into his garden, to the beds of spices, to feed in the gardens, and to gather
lilies.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C6V3">&nbsp;</a>I
<span class="add">am</span> my beloved’s, and my beloved
<span class="add">is</span> mine: he feedeth among the lilies.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C6V4">&nbsp;</a>Thou
<span class="add">art</span> beautiful, O my love, as Tirzah, comely as Jerusalem, terrible as
<span class="add">an army</span> with banners.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C6V5">&nbsp;</a>Turn away thine eyes from me, for they have overcome me: thy hair
<span class="add">is</span> as a flock of goats that appear from Gilead.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C6V6">&nbsp;</a>Thy teeth
<span class="add">are</span> as a flock of sheep which go up from the washing, whereof every one beareth twins, and
<span class="add">there is</span> not one barren among them.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C6V7">&nbsp;</a>As a piece of a pomegranate
<span class="add">are</span> thy temples within thy locks.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C6V8">&nbsp;</a>There are threescore queens, and fourscore concubines, and virgins without number.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C6V9">&nbsp;</a>My dove, my undefiled is
<span class="add">but</span> one; she
<span class="add">is</span> the
<span class="add">only</span> one of her mother, she
<span class="add">is</span> the choice
<span class="add">one
</span> of her that bare her. The daughters saw her, and blessed her;
<span class="add">yea,</span> the queens and the concubines, and they praised her.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C6V10">&nbsp;</a>Who
<span class="add">is</span> she
<span class="add">that</span> looketh forth as the morning, fair as the moon, clear as the sun,
<span class="add">and</span> terrible as
<span class="add">an army
</span> with banners?
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C6V11">&nbsp;</a>I went down into the garden of nuts to see the fruits of the valley,
<span class="add">and</span> to see whether the vine flourished,
<span class="add">and</span> the pomegranates budded.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C6V12">&nbsp;</a>Or ever I was aware, my soul made me
<span class="add">like</span> the chariots of Amminadib.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C6V13">&nbsp;</a>Return, return, O Shulamite; return, return, that we may look upon thee. What will ye see in the Shulamite?
As it were the company of two armies.
