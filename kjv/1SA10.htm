 <span class="verse" id="V1">1&nbsp;</span>Then Samuel took a vial of oil, and poured <span class='add'>it</span> upon his head, and kissed him, and said, <span class='add'>Is it</span> not because the LORD hath anointed thee <span class='add'>to be</span> captain over his inheritance?  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span>When thou art departed from me to day, then thou shalt find two men by Rachel’s sepulchre in the border of Benjamin at Zelzah; and they will say unto thee, The asses which thou wentest to seek are found: and, lo, thy father hath left the care of the asses, and sorroweth for you, saying, What shall I do for my son?  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>Then shalt thou go on forward from thence, and thou shalt come to the plain of Tabor, and there shall meet thee three men going up to God to Beth-el, one carrying three kids, and another carrying three loaves of bread, and another carrying a bottle of wine:  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>And they will salute thee, and give thee two <span class='add'>loaves</span> of bread; which thou shalt receive of their hands.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>After that thou shalt come to the hill of God, where <span class='add'>is</span> the garrison of the Philistines: and it shall come to pass, when thou art come thither to the city, that thou shalt meet a company of prophets coming down from the high place with a psaltery, and a tabret, and a pipe, and a harp, before them; and they shall prophesy:  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>And the Spirit of the LORD will come upon thee, and thou shalt prophesy with them, and shalt be turned into another man.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>And let it be, when these signs are come unto thee, <span class='add'>that</span> thou do as occasion serve thee; for God <span class='add'>is</span> with thee.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>And thou shalt go down before me to Gilgal; and, behold, I will come down unto thee, to offer burnt offerings, <span class='add'>and</span> to sacrifice sacrifices of peace offerings: seven days shalt thou tarry, till I come to thee, and shew thee what thou shalt do. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>And it was <span class='add'>so</span>, that when he had turned his back to go from Samuel, God gave him another heart: and all those signs came to pass that day.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>And when they came thither to the hill, behold, a company of prophets met him; and the Spirit of God came upon him, and he prophesied among them.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>And it came to pass, when all that knew him beforetime saw that, behold, he prophesied among the prophets, then the people said one to another, What <span class='add'>is</span> this <span class='add'>that</span> is come unto the son of Kish? <span class='add'>Is</span> Saul also among the prophets?  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>And one of the same place answered and said, But who <span class='add'>is</span> their father? Therefore it became a proverb, <span class='add'>Is</span> Saul also among the prophets?  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>And when he had made an end of prophesying, he came to the high place. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>And Saul’s uncle said unto him and to his servant, Whither went ye? And he said, To seek the asses: and when we saw that <span class='add'>they were</span> no where, we came to Samuel.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>And Saul’s uncle said, Tell me, I pray thee, what Samuel said unto you.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>And Saul said unto his uncle, He told us plainly that the asses were found. But of the matter of the kingdom, whereof Samuel spake, he told him not. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>And Samuel called the people together unto the LORD to Mizpeh;  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>And said unto the children of Israel, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, I brought up Israel out of Egypt, and delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of all kingdoms, <span class='add'>and</span> of them that oppressed you:  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>And ye have this day rejected your God, who himself saved you out of all your adversities and your tribulations; and ye have said unto him, <span class='add'>Nay</span>, but set a king over us. Now therefore present yourselves before the LORD by your tribes, and by your thousands.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>And when Samuel had caused all the tribes of Israel to come near, the tribe of Benjamin was taken.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>When he had caused the tribe of Benjamin to come near by their families, the family of Matri was taken, and Saul the son of Kish was taken: and when they sought him, he could not be found.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>Therefore they enquired of the LORD further, if the man should yet come thither. And the LORD answered, Behold, he hath hid himself among the stuff.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>And they ran and fetched him thence: and when he stood among the people, he was higher than any of the people from his shoulders and upward.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>And Samuel said to all the people, See ye him whom the LORD hath chosen, that <span class='add'>there is</span> none like him among all the people? And all the people shouted, and said, God save the king.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>Then Samuel told the people the manner of the kingdom, and wrote <span class='add'>it</span> in a book, and laid <span class='add'>it</span>up before the LORD. And Samuel sent all the people away, every man to his house. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>And Saul also went home to Gibeah; and there went with him a band of men, whose hearts God had touched.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>But the children of Belial said, How shall this man save us? And they despised him, and brought him no presents. But he held his peace. </div><ul class='tnav'>
