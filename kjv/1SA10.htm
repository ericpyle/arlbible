 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C10V1">&nbsp;</a>Then Samuel took a vial of oil, and poured
<span class="add">it</span> upon his head, and kissed him, and said,
<span class="add">Is it</span> not because the LORD hath anointed thee
<span class="add">to be</span> captain over his inheritance?
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C10V2">&nbsp;</a>When thou art departed from me to day, then thou shalt find two men by Rachel’s sepulchre in the border
of Benjamin at Zelzah; and they will say unto thee, The asses which thou wentest to seek are found: and,
lo, thy father hath left the care of the asses, and sorroweth for you, saying, What shall I do for my
son?
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C10V3">&nbsp;</a>Then shalt thou go on forward from thence, and thou shalt come to the plain of Tabor, and there shall
meet thee three men going up to God to Bethel, one carrying three kids, and another carrying three loaves
of bread, and another carrying a bottle of wine:
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C10V4">&nbsp;</a>And they will salute thee, and give thee two
<span class="add">loaves</span> of bread; which thou shalt receive of their hands.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C10V5">&nbsp;</a>After that thou shalt come to the hill of God, where
<span class="add">is</span> the garrison of the Philistines: and it shall come to pass, when thou art come thither to the city,
that thou shalt meet a company of prophets coming down from the high place with a psaltery, and a tabret,
and a pipe, and a harp, before them; and they shall prophesy:
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C10V6">&nbsp;</a>And the Spirit of the LORD will come upon thee, and thou shalt prophesy with them, and shalt be turned
into another man.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C10V7">&nbsp;</a>And let it be, when these signs are come unto thee,
<span class="add">that</span> thou do as occasion serve thee; for God
<span class="add">is</span> with thee.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C10V8">&nbsp;</a>And thou shalt go down before me to Gilgal; and, behold, I will come down unto thee, to offer burnt offerings,
<span class="add">and</span> to sacrifice sacrifices of peace offerings: seven days shalt thou tarry, till I come to thee, and shew
thee what thou shalt do.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C10V9">&nbsp;</a>And it was
<span class="add">so,</span> that when he had turned his back to go from Samuel, God gave him another heart: and all those signs
came to pass that day.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C10V10">&nbsp;</a>And when they came thither to the hill, behold, a company of prophets met him; and the Spirit of God
came upon him, and he prophesied among them.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C10V11">&nbsp;</a>And it came to pass, when all that knew him beforetime saw that, behold, he prophesied among the prophets,
then the people said one to another, What
<span class="add">is</span> this
<span class="add">that</span> is come unto the son of Kish?
<span class="add">Is
</span> Saul also among the prophets?
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C10V12">&nbsp;</a>And one of the same place answered and said, But who
<span class="add">is</span> their father? Therefore it became a proverb,
<span class="add">Is</span> Saul also among the prophets?
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C10V13">&nbsp;</a>And when he had made an end of prophesying, he came to the high place.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C10V14">&nbsp;</a>And Saul’s uncle said unto him and to his servant, Whither went ye? And he said, To seek the asses: and
when we saw that
<span class="add">they were</span> no where, we came to Samuel.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C10V15">&nbsp;</a>And Saul’s uncle said, Tell me, I pray thee, what Samuel said unto you.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C10V16">&nbsp;</a>And Saul said unto his uncle, He told us plainly that the asses were found. But of the matter of the
kingdom, whereof Samuel spake, he told him not.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C10V17">&nbsp;</a>And Samuel called the people together unto the LORD to Mizpeh;
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C10V18">&nbsp;</a>And said unto the children of Israel, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, I brought up Israel out of Egypt,
and delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of all kingdoms,
<span class="add">and</span> of them that oppressed you:
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C10V19">&nbsp;</a>And ye have this day rejected your God, who himself saved you out of all your adversities and your tribulations;
and ye have said unto him,
<span class="add">Nay,
</span> but set a king over us. Now therefore present yourselves before the LORD by your tribes, and by your
thousands.
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C10V20">&nbsp;</a>And when Samuel had caused all the tribes of Israel to come near, the tribe of Benjamin was taken.
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C10V21">&nbsp;</a>When he had caused the tribe of Benjamin to come near by their families, the family of Matri was taken,
and Saul the son of Kish was taken: and when they sought him, he could not be found.
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C10V22">&nbsp;</a>Therefore they enquired of the LORD further, if the man should yet come thither. And the LORD answered,
Behold, he hath hid himself among the stuff.
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C10V23">&nbsp;</a>And they ran and fetched him thence: and when he stood among the people, he was higher than any of the
people from his shoulders and upward.
 <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C10V24">&nbsp;</a>And Samuel said to all the people, See ye him whom the LORD hath chosen, that
<span class="add">there is</span> none like him among all the people? And all the people shouted, and said, God save the king.
 <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C10V25">&nbsp;</a>Then Samuel told the people the manner of the kingdom, and wrote
<span class="add">it</span> in a book, and laid
<span class="add">it
</span>up before the LORD. And Samuel sent all the people away, every man to his house.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C10V26">&nbsp;</a>And Saul also went home to Gibeah; and there went with him a band of men, whose hearts God had touched.
 <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C10V27">&nbsp;</a>But the children of Belial said, How shall this man save us? And they despised him, and brought him no
presents. But he held his peace.
