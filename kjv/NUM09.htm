 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C9V1">&nbsp;</a>And the LORD spake unto Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, in the first month of the second year after
they were come out of the land of Egypt, saying,
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C9V2">&nbsp;</a>Let the children of Israel also keep the passover at his appointed season.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C9V3">&nbsp;</a>In the fourteenth day of this month, at even, ye shall keep it in his appointed season: according to
all the rites of it, and according to all the ceremonies thereof, shall ye keep it.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C9V4">&nbsp;</a>And Moses spake unto the children of Israel, that they should keep the passover.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C9V5">&nbsp;</a>And they kept the passover on the fourteenth day of the first month at even in the wilderness of Sinai:
according to all that the LORD commanded Moses, so did the children of Israel.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C9V6">&nbsp;</a>And there were certain men, who were defiled by the dead body of a man, that they could not keep the
passover on that day: and they came before Moses and before Aaron on that day:
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C9V7">&nbsp;</a>And those men said unto him, We
<span class="add">are</span> defiled by the dead body of a man: wherefore are we kept back, that we may not offer an offering of
the LORD in his appointed season among the children of Israel?
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C9V8">&nbsp;</a>And Moses said unto them, Stand still, and I will hear what the LORD will command concerning you.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C9V9">&nbsp;</a>And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C9V10">&nbsp;</a>Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, If any man of you or of your posterity shall be unclean by
reason of a dead body, or
<span class="add">be</span> in a journey afar off, yet he shall keep the passover unto the LORD.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C9V11">&nbsp;</a>The fourteenth day of the second month at even they shall keep it,
<span class="add">and</span> eat it with unleavened bread and bitter
<span class="add">herbs.
</span> <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C9V12">&nbsp;</a>They shall leave none of it unto the morning, nor break any bone of it: according to all the ordinances
of the passover they shall keep it.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C9V13">&nbsp;</a>But the man that
<span class="add">is</span> clean, and is not in a journey, and forbeareth to keep the passover, even the same soul shall be cut
off from among his people: because he brought not the offering of the LORD in his appointed season, that
man shall bear his sin.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C9V14">&nbsp;</a>And if a stranger shall sojourn among you, and will keep the passover unto the LORD; according to the
ordinance of the passover, and according to the manner thereof, so shall he do: ye shall have one ordinance,
both for the stranger, and for him that was born in the land.

<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C9V15">&nbsp;</a>And on the day that the tabernacle was reared up the cloud covered the tabernacle,
<span class="add">namely,</span> the tent of the testimony: and at even there was upon the tabernacle as it were the appearance of fire,
until the morning.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C9V16">&nbsp;</a>So it was alway: the cloud covered it
<span class="add">by day,</span> and the appearance of fire by night.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C9V17">&nbsp;</a>And when the cloud was taken up from the tabernacle, then after that the children of Israel journeyed:
and in the place where the cloud abode, there the children of Israel pitched their tents.
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C9V18">&nbsp;</a>At the commandment of the LORD the children of Israel journeyed, and at the commandment of the LORD they
pitched: as long as the cloud abode upon the tabernacle they rested in their tents.
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C9V19">&nbsp;</a>And when the cloud tarried long upon the tabernacle many days, then the children of Israel kept the charge
of the LORD, and journeyed not.
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C9V20">&nbsp;</a>And
<span class="add">so</span> it was, when the cloud was a few days upon the tabernacle; according to the commandment of the LORD
they abode in their tents, and according to the commandment of the LORD they journeyed.
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C9V21">&nbsp;</a>And
<span class="add">so</span> it was, when the cloud abode from even unto the morning, and
<span class="add">that</span> the cloud was taken up in the morning, then they journeyed: whether
<span class="add">it was</span> by day or by night that the cloud was taken up, they journeyed.
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C9V22">&nbsp;</a>Or
<span class="add">whether it were</span> two days, or a month, or a year, that the cloud tarried upon the tabernacle, remaining thereon, the
children of Israel abode in their tents, and journeyed not: but when it was taken up, they journeyed.
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C9V23">&nbsp;</a>At the commandment of the LORD they rested in the tents, and at the commandment of the LORD they journeyed:
they kept the charge of the LORD, at the commandment of the LORD by the hand of Moses.
