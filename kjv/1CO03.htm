 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C3V1">&nbsp;</a>And I, brethren, could not speak unto you as unto spiritual, but as unto carnal,
<span class="add">even</span> as unto babes in Christ.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C3V2">&nbsp;</a>I have fed you with milk, and not with meat: for hitherto ye were not able
<span class="add">to bear it,</span> neither yet now are ye able.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C3V3">&nbsp;</a>For ye are yet carnal: for whereas
<span class="add">there is</span> among you envying, and strife, and divisions, are ye not carnal, and walk as men?
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C3V4">&nbsp;</a>For while one saith, I am of Paul; and another, I
<span class="add">am</span> of Apollos; are ye not carnal?
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C3V5">&nbsp;</a>Who then is Paul, and who
<span class="add">is</span> Apollos, but ministers by whom ye believed, even as the Lord gave to every man?
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C3V6">&nbsp;</a>I have planted, Apollos watered; but God gave the increase.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C3V7">&nbsp;</a>So then neither is he that planteth any thing, neither he that watereth; but God that giveth the increase.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C3V8">&nbsp;</a>Now he that planteth and he that watereth are one: and every man shall receive his own reward according
to his own labour.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C3V9">&nbsp;</a>For we are labourers together with God: ye are God’s husbandry,
<span class="add">ye are</span> God’s building.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C3V10">&nbsp;</a>According to the grace of God which is given unto me, as a wise masterbuilder, I have laid the foundation,
and another buildeth thereon. But let every man take heed how he buildeth thereupon.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C3V11">&nbsp;</a>For other foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which is Jesus Christ.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C3V12">&nbsp;</a>Now if any man build upon this foundation gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, stubble;
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C3V13">&nbsp;</a>Every man’s work shall be made manifest: for the day shall declare it, because it shall be revealed by
fire; and the fire shall try every man’s work of what sort it is.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C3V14">&nbsp;</a>If any man’s work abide which he hath built thereupon, he shall receive a reward.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C3V15">&nbsp;</a>If any man’s work shall be burned, he shall suffer loss: but he himself shall be saved; yet so as by
fire.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C3V16">&nbsp;</a>Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and
<span class="add">that</span> the Spirit of God dwelleth in you?
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C3V17">&nbsp;</a>If any man defile the temple of God, him shall God destroy; for the temple of God is holy, which
<span class="add">temple</span> ye are.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C3V18">&nbsp;</a>Let no man deceive himself. If any man among you seemeth to be wise in this world, let him become a fool,
that he may be wise.
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C3V19">&nbsp;</a>For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For it is written, He taketh the wise in their
own craftiness.
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C3V20">&nbsp;</a>And again, The Lord knoweth the thoughts of the wise, that they are vain.
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C3V21">&nbsp;</a>Therefore let no man glory in men. For all things are yours;
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C3V22">&nbsp;</a>Whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to
come; all are yours;
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C3V23">&nbsp;</a>And ye are Christ’s; and Christ
<span class="add">is</span> God’s.
