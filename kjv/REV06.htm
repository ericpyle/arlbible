 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C6V1">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And I saw when the Lamb opened one of the seals, and I heard, as it were the noise of thunder, one of
the four beasts saying, Come and see.
</span> <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C6V2">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And I saw, and behold a white horse: and he that sat on him had a bow; and a crown was given unto him:
and he went forth conquering, and to conquer.
</span> <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C6V3">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And when he had opened the second seal, I heard the second beast say, Come and see.
</span> <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C6V4">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And there went out another horse
</span><span class="add">that was</span><span class="wj"> red: and
</span><span class="add">power</span><span class="wj"> was given to him that sat thereon to take peace from the earth, and that they should kill one another:
and there was given unto him a great sword.
</span> <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C6V5">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And when he had opened the third seal, I heard the third beast say, Come and see. And I beheld, and lo
a black horse; and he that sat on him had a pair of balances in his hand.
</span> <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C6V6">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And I heard a voice in the midst of the four beasts say, A measure of wheat for a penny, and three measures
of barley for a penny; and
</span><span class="add">see
</span><span class="wj"> thou hurt not the oil and the wine.
</span> <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C6V7">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And when he had opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth beast say, Come and see.
</span> <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C6V8">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And I looked, and behold a pale horse: and his name that sat on him was Death, and Hell followed with
him. And power was given unto them over the fourth part of the earth, to kill with sword, and with hunger,
and with death, and with the beasts of the earth.
</span> <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C6V9">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And when he had opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of them that were slain for the
word of God, and for the testimony which they held:
</span> <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C6V10">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And they cried with a loud voice, saying, How long, O Lord, holy and true, dost thou not judge and avenge
our blood on them that dwell on the earth?
</span> <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C6V11">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And white robes were given unto every one of them; and it was said unto them, that they should rest yet
for a little season, until their fellowservants also and their brethren, that should be killed as they
</span><span class="add">were,</span><span class="wj"> should be fulfilled.
</span> <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C6V12">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And I beheld when he had opened the sixth seal, and, lo, there was a great earthquake; and the sun became
black as sackcloth of hair, and the moon became as blood;
</span> <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C6V13">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And the stars of heaven fell unto the earth, even as a fig tree casteth her untimely figs, when she is
shaken of a mighty wind.
</span> <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C6V14">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And the heaven departed as a scroll when it is rolled together; and every mountain and island were moved
out of their places.
</span> <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C6V15">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And the kings of the earth, and the great men, and the rich men, and the chief captains, and the mighty
men, and every bondman, and every free man, hid themselves in the dens and in the rocks of the mountains;
</span> <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C6V16">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And said to the mountains and rocks, Fall on us, and hide us from the face of him that sitteth on the
throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb:
</span> <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C6V17">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">For the great day of his wrath is come; and who shall be able to stand?</span></div>
