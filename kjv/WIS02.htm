 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C2V1">&nbsp;</a>For the ungodly said, reasoning with themselves, but not aright, Our life is short and tedious, and in
the death of a man there is no remedy: neither was there any man known to have returned from the grave.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C2V2">&nbsp;</a>For we are born at all adventure: and we shall be hereafter as though we had never been: for the breath
in our nostrils is as smoke, and a little spark in the moving of our heart:
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C2V3">&nbsp;</a>Which being extinguished, our body shall be turned into ashes, and our spirit shall vanish as the soft
air,
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C2V4">&nbsp;</a>And our name shall be forgotten in time, and no man shall have our works in remembrance, and our life
shall pass away as the trace of a cloud, and shall be dispersed as a mist, that is driven away with the
beams of the sun, and overcome with the heat thereof.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C2V5">&nbsp;</a>For our time is a very shadow that passeth away; and after our end there is no returning: for it is fast
sealed, so that no man cometh again.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C2V6">&nbsp;</a>Come on therefore, let us enjoy the good things that are present: and let us speedily use the creatures
like as in youth.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C2V7">&nbsp;</a>Let us fill ourselves with costly wine and ointments: and let no flower of the spring pass by us:
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C2V8">&nbsp;</a>Let us crown ourselves with rosebuds, before they be withered:
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C2V9">&nbsp;</a>Let none of us go without his part of our voluptuousness: let us leave tokens of our joyfulness in every
place: for this is our portion, and our lot is this.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C2V10">&nbsp;</a>Let us oppress the poor righteous man, let us not spare the widow, nor reverence the ancient gray hairs
of the aged.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C2V11">&nbsp;</a>Let our strength be the law of justice: for that which is feeble is found to be nothing worth.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C2V12">&nbsp;</a>Therefore let us lie in wait for the righteous; because he is not for our turn, and he is clean contrary
to our doings: he upbraideth us with our offending the law, and objecteth to our infamy the transgressings
of our education.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C2V13">&nbsp;</a>He professeth to have the knowledge of God: and he calleth himself the child of the Lord.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C2V14">&nbsp;</a>He was made to reprove our thoughts.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C2V15">&nbsp;</a>He is grievous unto us even to behold: for his life is not like other men’s, his ways are of another
fashion.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C2V16">&nbsp;</a>We are esteemed of him as counterfeits: he abstaineth from our ways as from filthiness: he pronounceth
the end of the just to be blessed, and maketh his boast that God is his father.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C2V17">&nbsp;</a>Let us see if his words be true: and let us prove what shall happen in the end of him.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C2V18">&nbsp;</a>For if the just man be the son of God, he will help him, and deliver him from the hand of his enemies.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C2V19">&nbsp;</a>Let us examine him with despitefulness and torture, that we may know his meekness, and prove his patience.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C2V20">&nbsp;</a>Let us condemn him with a shameful death: for by his own saying he shall be respected.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C2V21">&nbsp;</a>Such things they did imagine, and were deceived: for their own wickedness hath blinded them.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C2V22">&nbsp;</a>As for the mysteries of God, they kn ew them not: neither hoped they for the wages of righteousness,
nor discerned a reward for blameless souls.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C2V23">&nbsp;</a>For God created man to be immortal, and made him to be an image of his own eternity.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C2V24">&nbsp;</a>Nevertheless through envy of the devil came death into the world: and they that do hold of his side do
find it.
