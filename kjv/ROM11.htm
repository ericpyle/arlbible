<div class="chapterlabel"> 11</div><div class="p">
 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C11V1">&nbsp;</a>I say then, Hath God cast away his people? God forbid. For I also am an Israelite, of the seed of Abraham,
<span class="add">of</span> the tribe of Benjamin.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C11V2">&nbsp;</a>God hath not cast away his people which he foreknew. Wot ye not what the scripture saith of Elias? how
he maketh intercession to God against Israel, saying,
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C11V3">&nbsp;</a>Lord, they have killed thy prophets, and digged down thine altars; and I am left alone, and they seek
my life.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C11V4">&nbsp;</a>But what saith the answer of God unto him? I have reserved to myself seven thousand men, who have not
bowed the knee to
<span class="add">the image of</span> Baal.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C11V5">&nbsp;</a>Even so then at this present time also there is a remnant according to the election of grace.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C11V6">&nbsp;</a>And if by grace, then
<span class="add">is it</span> no more of works: otherwise grace is no more grace. But if
<span class="add">it be</span> of works, then is it no more grace: otherwise work is no more work.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C11V7">&nbsp;</a>What then? Israel hath not obtained that which he seeketh for; but the election hath obtained it, and
the rest were blinded
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C11V8">&nbsp;</a>(According as it is written, God hath given them the spirit of slumber, eyes that they should not see,
and ears that they should not hear;) unto this day.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C11V9">&nbsp;</a>And David saith, Let their table be made a snare, and a trap, and a stumblingblock, and a recompence
unto them:
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C11V10">&nbsp;</a>Let their eyes be darkened, that they may not see, and bow down their back alway.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C11V11">&nbsp;</a>I say then, Have they stumbled that they should fall? God forbid: but
<span class="add">rather</span> through their fall salvation
<span class="add">is come</span> unto the Gentiles, for to provoke them to jealousy.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C11V12">&nbsp;</a>Now if the fall of them
<span class="add">be</span> the riches of the world, and the diminishing of them the riches of the Gentiles; how much more their
fulness?
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C11V13">&nbsp;</a>For I speak to you Gentiles, inasmuch as I am the apostle of the Gentiles, I magnify mine office:
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C11V14">&nbsp;</a>If by any means I may provoke to emulation
<span class="add">them which are</span> my flesh, and might save some of them.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C11V15">&nbsp;</a>For if the casting away of them
<span class="add">be</span> the reconciling of the world, what
<span class="add">shall</span> the receiving
<span class="add">of them be,</span> but life from the dead?
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C11V16">&nbsp;</a>For if the firstfruit
<span class="add">be</span> holy, the lump
<span class="add">is</span> also
<span class="add">holy:</span> and if the root
<span class="add">be</span> holy, so
<span class="add">are</span> the branches.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C11V17">&nbsp;</a>And if some of the branches be broken off, and thou, being a wild olive tree, wert graffed in among them,
and with them partakest of the root and fatness of the olive tree;
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C11V18">&nbsp;</a>Boast not against the branches. But if thou boast, thou bearest not the root, but the root thee.
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C11V19">&nbsp;</a>Thou wilt say then, The branches were broken off, that I might be graffed in.
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C11V20">&nbsp;</a>Well; because of unbelief they were broken off, and thou standest by faith. Be not highminded, but fear:
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C11V21">&nbsp;</a>For if God spared not the natural branches,
<span class="add">take heed</span> lest he also spare not thee.
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C11V22">&nbsp;</a>Behold therefore the goodness and severity of God: on them which fell, severity; but toward thee, goodness,
if thou continue in
<span class="add">his</span> goodness: otherwise thou also shalt be cut off.
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C11V23">&nbsp;</a>And they also, if they abide not still in unbelief, shall be graffed in: for God is able to graff them
in again.
 <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C11V24">&nbsp;</a>For if thou wert cut out of the olive tree which is wild by nature, and wert graffed contrary to nature
into a good olive tree: how much more shall these, which be the natural
<span class="add">branches,</span> be graffed into their own olive tree?
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C11V25">&nbsp;</a>For I would not, brethren, that ye should be ignorant of this mystery, lest ye should be wise in your
own conceits; that blindness in part is happened to Israel, until the fulness of the Gentiles be come
in.
 <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C11V26">&nbsp;</a>And so all Israel shall be saved: as it is written, There shall come out of Sion the Deliverer, and shall
turn away ungodliness from Jacob:
 <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C11V27">&nbsp;</a>For this
<span class="add">is</span> my covenant unto them, when I shall take away their sins.
 <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C11V28">&nbsp;</a>As concerning the gospel,
<span class="add">they are</span> enemies for your sakes: but as touching the election,
<span class="add">they are</span> beloved for the fathers’ sakes.
 <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C11V29">&nbsp;</a>For the gifts and calling of God
<span class="add">are</span> without repentance.
 <span class="verse"> 30</span><a name="C11V30">&nbsp;</a>For as ye in times past have not believed God, yet have now obtained mercy through their unbelief:
 <span class="verse"> 31</span><a name="C11V31">&nbsp;</a>Even so have these also now not believed, that through your mercy they also may obtain mercy.
 <span class="verse"> 32</span><a name="C11V32">&nbsp;</a>For God hath concluded them all in unbelief, that he might have mercy upon all.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 33</span><a name="C11V33">&nbsp;</a>O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God! how unsearchable
<span class="add">are</span> his judgments, and his ways past finding out!
 <span class="verse"> 34</span><a name="C11V34">&nbsp;</a>For who hath known the mind of the Lord? or who hath been his counsellor?
 <span class="verse"> 35</span><a name="C11V35">&nbsp;</a>Or who hath first given to him, and it shall be recompensed unto him again?
 <span class="verse"> 36</span><a name="C11V36">&nbsp;</a>For of him, and through him, and to him,
<span class="add">are</span> all things: to whom
<span class="add">be</span> glory for ever. Amen.
