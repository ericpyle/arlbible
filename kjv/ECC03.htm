 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C3V1">&nbsp;</a>To every
<span class="add">thing there is</span> a season, and a time to every purpose under the heaven:
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C3V2">&nbsp;</a>A time to be born, and a time to die; a time to plant, and a time to pluck up
<span class="add">that which is</span> planted;
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C3V3">&nbsp;</a>A time to kill, and a time to heal; a time to break down, and a time to build up;
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C3V4">&nbsp;</a>A time to weep, and a time to laugh; a time to mourn, and a time to dance;
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C3V5">&nbsp;</a>A time to cast away stones, and a time to gather stones together; a time to embrace, and a time to refrain
from embracing;
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C3V6">&nbsp;</a>A time to get, and a time to lose; a time to keep, and a time to cast away;
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C3V7">&nbsp;</a>A time to rend, and a time to sew; a time to keep silence, and a time to speak;
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C3V8">&nbsp;</a>A time to love, and a time to hate; a time of war, and a time of peace.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C3V9">&nbsp;</a>What profit hath he that worketh in that wherein he laboureth?
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C3V10">&nbsp;</a>I have seen the travail, which God hath given to the sons of men to be exercised in it.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C3V11">&nbsp;</a>He hath made every
<span class="add">thing</span> beautiful in his time: also he hath set the world in their heart, so that no man can find out the work
that God maketh from the beginning to the end.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C3V12">&nbsp;</a>I know that
<span class="add">there is</span> no good in them, but for
<span class="add">a man</span> to rejoice, and to do good in his life.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C3V13">&nbsp;</a>And also that every man should eat and drink, and enjoy the good of all his labour, it
<span class="add">is</span> the gift of God.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C3V14">&nbsp;</a>I know that, whatsoever God doeth, it shall be for ever: nothing can be put to it, nor any thing taken
from it: and God doeth
<span class="add">it,</span> that
<span class="add">men</span> should fear before him.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C3V15">&nbsp;</a>That which hath been is now; and that which is to be hath already been; and God requireth that which
is past.

<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C3V16">&nbsp;</a>And moreover I saw under the sun the place of judgment,
<span class="add">that</span> wickedness
<span class="add">was</span> there; and the place of righteousness,
<span class="add">that</span> iniquity
<span class="add">was</span> there.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C3V17">&nbsp;</a>I said in mine heart, God shall judge the righteous and the wicked: for
<span class="add">there is</span> a time there for every purpose and for every work.
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C3V18">&nbsp;</a>I said in mine heart concerning the estate of the sons of men, that God might manifest them, and that
they might see that they themselves are beasts.
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C3V19">&nbsp;</a>For that which befalleth the sons of men befalleth beasts; even one thing befalleth them: as the one
dieth, so dieth the other; yea, they have all one breath; so that a man hath no preeminence above a beast:
for all
<span class="add">is</span> vanity.
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C3V20">&nbsp;</a>All go unto one place; all are of the dust, and all turn to dust again.
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C3V21">&nbsp;</a>Who knoweth the spirit of man that goeth upward, and the spirit of the beast that goeth downward to the
earth?
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C3V22">&nbsp;</a>Wherefore I perceive that
<span class="add">there is</span> nothing better, than that a man should rejoice in his own works; for that
<span class="add">is</span> his portion: for who shall bring him to see what shall be after him?
