 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C22V1">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Men, brethren, and fathers, hear ye my defence
</span><span class="add">which I make
</span><span class="wj">now unto you.
</span> <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C22V2">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">(And when they heard that he spake in the Hebrew tongue to them, they kept the more silence: and he saith,)
</span> <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C22V3">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">I am verily a man
</span><span class="add">which am</span><span class="wj">a Jew, born in Tarsus, a city in Cilicia, yet brought up in this city at the feet of Gamaliel,
</span><span class="add">and</span><span class="wj">taught according to the perfect manner of the law of the fathers, and was zealous toward God, as ye all
are this day.
</span> <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C22V4">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And I persecuted this way unto the death, binding and delivering into prisons both men and women.
</span> <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C22V5">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">As also the high priest doth bear me witness, and all the estate of the elders: from whom also I received
letters unto the brethren, and went to Damascus, to bring them which were there bound unto Jerusalem,
for to be punished.
</span> <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C22V6">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And it came to pass, that, as I made my journey, and was come nigh unto Damascus about noon, suddenly
there shone from heaven a great light round about me.
</span> <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C22V7">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And I fell unto the ground, and heard a voice saying unto me, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?
</span> <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C22V8">&nbsp;</a>And I answered, Who art thou, Lord? And he said unto me,
<span class="wj">I am Jesus of Nazareth, whom thou persecutest.
</span> <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C22V9">&nbsp;</a>And they that were with me saw indeed the light, and were afraid; but they heard not the voice of him
that spake to me.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C22V10">&nbsp;</a>And I said, What shall I do, Lord? And the Lord said unto me,
<span class="wj">Arise, and go into Damascus; and there it shall be told thee of all things which are appointed for thee
to do.
</span> <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C22V11">&nbsp;</a>And when I could not see for the glory of that light, being led by the hand of them that were with me,
I came into Damascus.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C22V12">&nbsp;</a>And one Ananias, a devout man according to the law, having a good report of all the Jews which dwelt
<span class="add">there,
</span> <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C22V13">&nbsp;</a>Came unto me, and stood, and said unto me, Brother Saul, receive thy sight. And the same hour I looked
up upon him.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C22V14">&nbsp;</a>And he said, The God of our fathers hath chosen thee, that thou shouldest know his will, and see that
Just One, and shouldest hear the voice of his mouth.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C22V15">&nbsp;</a>For thou shalt be his witness unto all men of what thou hast seen and heard.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C22V16">&nbsp;</a>And now why tarriest thou? arise, and be baptized, and wash away thy sins, calling on the name of the
Lord.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C22V17">&nbsp;</a>And it came to pass, that, when I was come again to Jerusalem, even while I prayed in the temple, I was
in a trance;
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C22V18">&nbsp;</a>And saw him saying unto me,
<span class="wj">Make haste, and get thee quickly out of Jerusalem: for they will not receive thy testimony concerning
me.
</span> <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C22V19">&nbsp;</a>And I said, Lord, they know that I imprisoned and beat in every synagogue them that believed on thee:
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C22V20">&nbsp;</a>And when the blood of thy martyr Stephen was shed, I also was standing by, and consenting unto his death,
and kept the raiment of them that slew him.
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C22V21">&nbsp;</a>And he said unto me,
<span class="wj">Depart: for I will send thee far hence unto the Gentiles.
</span> <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C22V22">&nbsp;</a>And they gave him audience unto this word, and
<span class="add">then</span> lifted up their voices, and said, Away with such a
<span class="add">fellow</span> from the earth: for it is not fit that he should live.
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C22V23">&nbsp;</a>And as they cried out, and cast off
<span class="add">their</span> clothes, and threw dust into the air,
 <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C22V24">&nbsp;</a>The chief captain commanded him to be brought into the castle, and bade that he should be examined by
scourging; that he might know wherefore they cried so against him.
 <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C22V25">&nbsp;</a>And as they bound him with thongs, Paul said unto the centurion that stood by, Is it lawful for you to
scourge a man that is a Roman, and uncondemned?
 <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C22V26">&nbsp;</a>When the centurion heard
<span class="add">that,</span> he went and told the chief captain, saying, Take heed what thou doest: for this man is a Roman.
 <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C22V27">&nbsp;</a>Then the chief captain came, and said unto him, Tell me, art thou a Roman? He said, Yea.
 <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C22V28">&nbsp;</a>And the chief captain answered, With a great sum obtained I this freedom. And Paul said, But I was
<span class="add">free</span> born.
 <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C22V29">&nbsp;</a>Then straightway they departed from him which should have examined him: and the chief captain also was
afraid, after he knew that he was a Roman, and because he had bound him.
 <span class="verse"> 30</span><a name="C22V30">&nbsp;</a>On the morrow, because he would have known the certainty wherefore he was accused of the Jews, he loosed
him from
<span class="add">his</span> bands, and commanded the chief priests and all their council to appear, and brought Paul down, and set
him before them.
