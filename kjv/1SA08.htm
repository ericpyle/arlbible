 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C8V1">&nbsp;</a>And it came to pass, when Samuel was old, that he made his sons judges over Israel.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C8V2">&nbsp;</a>Now the name of his firstborn was Joel; and the name of his second, Abiah:
<span class="add">they were</span> judges in Beer-sheba.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C8V3">&nbsp;</a>And his sons walked not in his ways, but turned aside after lucre, and took bribes, and perverted judgment.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C8V4">&nbsp;</a>Then all the elders of Israel gathered themselves together, and came to Samuel unto Ramah,
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C8V5">&nbsp;</a>And said unto him, Behold, thou art old, and thy sons walk not in thy ways: now make us a king to judge
us like all the nations.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C8V6">&nbsp;</a>But the thing displeased Samuel, when they said, Give us a king to judge us. And Samuel prayed unto the
LORD.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C8V7">&nbsp;</a>And the LORD said unto Samuel, Hearken unto the voice of the people in all that they say unto thee: for
they have not rejected thee, but they have rejected me, that I should not reign over them.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C8V8">&nbsp;</a>According to all the works which they have done since the day that I brought them up out of Egypt even
unto this day, wherewith they have forsaken me, and served other gods, so do they also unto thee.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C8V9">&nbsp;</a>Now therefore hearken unto their voice: howbeit yet protest solemnly unto them, and shew them the manner
of the king that shall reign over them.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C8V10">&nbsp;</a>And Samuel told all the words of the LORD unto the people that asked of him a king.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C8V11">&nbsp;</a>And he said, This will be the manner of the king that shall reign over you: He will take your sons, and
appoint
<span class="add">them</span> for himself, for his chariots, and to be his horsemen; and
<span class="add">some</span> shall run before his chariots.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C8V12">&nbsp;</a>And he will appoint him captains over thousands, and captains over fifties; and
<span class="add">will set them</span> to ear his ground, and to reap his harvest, and to make his instruments of war, and instruments of his
chariots.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C8V13">&nbsp;</a>And he will take your daughters
<span class="add">to be</span> confectionaries, and
<span class="add">to be</span> cooks, and
<span class="add">to be</span> bakers.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C8V14">&nbsp;</a>And he will take your fields, and your vineyards, and your oliveyards,
<span class="add">even</span> the best
<span class="add">of them,</span> and give
<span class="add">them</span> to his servants.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C8V15">&nbsp;</a>And he will take the tenth of your seed, and of your vineyards, and give to his officers, and to his
servants.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C8V16">&nbsp;</a>And he will take your menservants, and your maidservants, and your goodliest young men, and your asses,
and put
<span class="add">them</span> to his work.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C8V17">&nbsp;</a>He will take the tenth of your sheep: and ye shall be his servants.
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C8V18">&nbsp;</a>And ye shall cry out in that day because of your king which ye shall have chosen you; and the LORD will
not hear you in that day.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C8V19">&nbsp;</a>Nevertheless the people refused to obey the voice of Samuel; and they said, Nay; but we will have a king
over us;
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C8V20">&nbsp;</a>That we also may be like all the nations; and that our king may judge us, and go out before us, and fight
our battles.
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C8V21">&nbsp;</a>And Samuel heard all the words of the people, and he rehearsed them in the ears of the LORD.
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C8V22">&nbsp;</a>And the LORD said to Samuel, Hearken unto their voice, and make them a king. And Samuel said unto the
men of Israel, Go ye every man unto his city.
