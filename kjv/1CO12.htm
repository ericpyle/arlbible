<div class="chapterlabel"> 12</div><div class="p">
 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C12V1">&nbsp;</a>Now concerning spiritual
<span class="add">gifts,</span> brethren, I would not have you ignorant.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C12V2">&nbsp;</a>Ye know that ye were Gentiles, carried away unto these dumb idols, even as ye were led.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C12V3">&nbsp;</a>Wherefore I give you to understand, that no man speaking by the Spirit of God calleth Jesus accursed:
and
<span class="add">that</span> no man can say that Jesus is the Lord, but by the Holy Ghost.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C12V4">&nbsp;</a>Now there are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C12V5">&nbsp;</a>And there are differences of administrations, but the same Lord.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C12V6">&nbsp;</a>And there are diversities of operations, but it is the same God which worketh all in all.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C12V7">&nbsp;</a>But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man to profit withal.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C12V8">&nbsp;</a>For to one is given by the Spirit the word of wisdom; to another the word of knowledge by the same Spirit;
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C12V9">&nbsp;</a>To another faith by the same Spirit; to another the gifts of healing by the same Spirit;
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C12V10">&nbsp;</a>To another the working of miracles; to another prophecy; to another discerning of spirits; to another
<span class="add">divers</span> kinds of tongues; to another the interpretation of tongues:
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C12V11">&nbsp;</a>But all these worketh that one and the selfsame Spirit, dividing to every man severally as he will.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C12V12">&nbsp;</a>For as the body is one, and hath many members, and all the members of that one body, being many, are
one body: so also
<span class="add">is</span> Christ.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C12V13">&nbsp;</a>For by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body, whether
<span class="add">we be
</span> Jews or Gentiles, whether
<span class="add">we be</span> bond or free; and have been all made to drink into one Spirit.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C12V14">&nbsp;</a>For the body is not one member, but many.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C12V15">&nbsp;</a>If the foot shall say, Because I am not the hand, I am not of the body; is it therefore not of the body?
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C12V16">&nbsp;</a>And if the ear shall say, Because I am not the eye, I am not of the body; is it therefore not of the
body?
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C12V17">&nbsp;</a>If the whole body
<span class="add">were</span> an eye, where
<span class="add">were</span> the hearing? If the whole
<span class="add">were</span> hearing, where
<span class="add">were</span> the smelling?
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C12V18">&nbsp;</a>But now hath God set the members every one of them in the body, as it hath pleased him.
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C12V19">&nbsp;</a>And if they were all one member, where
<span class="add">were</span> the body?
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C12V20">&nbsp;</a>But now
<span class="add">are they</span> many members, yet but one body.
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C12V21">&nbsp;</a>And the eye cannot say unto the hand, I have no need of thee: nor again the head to the feet, I have
no need of you.
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C12V22">&nbsp;</a>Nay, much more those members of the body, which seem to be more feeble, are necessary:
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C12V23">&nbsp;</a>And those
<span class="add">members</span> of the body, which we think to be less honourable, upon these we bestow more abundant honour; and our
uncomely
<span class="add">parts</span> have more abundant comeliness.
 <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C12V24">&nbsp;</a>For our comely
<span class="add">parts</span> have no need: but God hath tempered the body together, having given more abundant honour to that
<span class="add">part</span> which lacked:
 <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C12V25">&nbsp;</a>That there should be no schism in the body; but
<span class="add">that</span> the members should have the same care one for another.
 <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C12V26">&nbsp;</a>And whether one member suffer, all the members suffer with it; or one member be honoured, all the members
rejoice with it.
 <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C12V27">&nbsp;</a>Now ye are the body of Christ, and members in particular.
 <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C12V28">&nbsp;</a>And God hath set some in the church, first apostles, secondarily prophets, thirdly teachers, after that
miracles, then gifts of healings, helps, governments, diversities of tongues.
 <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C12V29">&nbsp;</a><span class="add">Are</span> all apostles?
<span class="add">are</span> all prophets?
<span class="add">are
</span> all teachers?
<span class="add">are</span> all workers of miracles?
 <span class="verse"> 30</span><a name="C12V30">&nbsp;</a>Have all the gifts of healing? do all speak with tongues? do all interpret?
 <span class="verse"> 31</span><a name="C12V31">&nbsp;</a>But covet earnestly the best gifts: and yet shew I unto you a more excellent way.
