 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C16V1">&nbsp;</a>So they brought the ark of God, and set it in the midst of the tent that David had pitched for it: and
they offered burnt sacrifices and peace offerings before God.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C16V2">&nbsp;</a>And when David had made an end of offering the burnt offerings and the peace offerings, he blessed the
people in the name of the LORD.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C16V3">&nbsp;</a>And he dealt to every one of Israel, both man and woman, to every one a loaf of bread, and a good piece
of flesh, and a flagon
<span class="add">of wine.
</span></div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C16V4">&nbsp;</a>And he appointed
<span class="add">certain</span> of the Levites to minister before the ark of the LORD, and to record, and to thank and praise the LORD
God of Israel:
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C16V5">&nbsp;</a>Asaph the chief, and next to him Zechariah, Jeiel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Mattithiah, and Eliab,
and Benaiah, and Obed-edom: and Jeiel with psalteries and with harps; but Asaph made a sound with cymbals;
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C16V6">&nbsp;</a>Benaiah also and Jahaziel the priests with trumpets continually before the ark of the covenant of God.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C16V7">&nbsp;</a>Then on that day David delivered first
<span class="add">this psalm</span> to thank the LORD into the hand of Asaph and his brethren.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C16V8">&nbsp;</a>Give thanks unto the LORD, call upon his name, make known his deeds among the people.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C16V9">&nbsp;</a>Sing unto him, sing psalms unto him, talk ye of all his wondrous works.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C16V10">&nbsp;</a>Glory ye in his holy name: let the heart of them rejoice that seek the LORD.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C16V11">&nbsp;</a>Seek the LORD and his strength, seek his face continually.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C16V12">&nbsp;</a>Remember his marvellous works that he hath done, his wonders, and the judgments of his mouth;
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C16V13">&nbsp;</a>O ye seed of Israel his servant, ye children of Jacob, his chosen ones.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C16V14">&nbsp;</a>He
<span class="add">is</span> the LORD our God; his judgments
<span class="add">are</span> in all the earth.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C16V15">&nbsp;</a>Be ye mindful always of his covenant; the word
<span class="add">which</span> he commanded to a thousand generations;
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C16V16">&nbsp;</a><span class="add">Even of the covenant</span> which he made with Abraham, and of his oath unto Isaac;
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C16V17">&nbsp;</a>And hath confirmed the same to Jacob for a law,
<span class="add">and</span> to Israel
<span class="add">for</span> an everlasting covenant,
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C16V18">&nbsp;</a>Saying, Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan, the lot of your inheritance;
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C16V19">&nbsp;</a>When ye were but few, even a few, and strangers in it.
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C16V20">&nbsp;</a>And
<span class="add">when</span> they went from nation to nation, and from
<span class="add">one
</span> kingdom to another people;
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C16V21">&nbsp;</a>He suffered no man to do them wrong: yea, he reproved kings for their sakes,
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C16V22">&nbsp;</a><span class="add">Saying,</span> Touch not mine anointed, and do my prophets no harm.
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C16V23">&nbsp;</a>Sing unto the LORD, all the earth; shew forth from day to day his salvation.
 <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C16V24">&nbsp;</a>Declare his glory among the heathen; his marvellous works among all nations.
 <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C16V25">&nbsp;</a>For great
<span class="add">is</span> the LORD, and greatly to be praised: he also
<span class="add">is</span> to be feared above all gods.
 <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C16V26">&nbsp;</a>For all the gods of the people
<span class="add">are</span> idols: but the LORD made the heavens.
 <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C16V27">&nbsp;</a>Glory and honour
<span class="add">are</span> in his presence; strength and gladness
<span class="add">are</span> in his place.
 <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C16V28">&nbsp;</a>Give unto the LORD, ye kindreds of the people, give unto the LORD glory and strength.
 <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C16V29">&nbsp;</a>Give unto the LORD the glory
<span class="add">due</span> unto his name: bring an offering, and come before him: worship the LORD in the beauty of holiness.
 <span class="verse"> 30</span><a name="C16V30">&nbsp;</a>Fear before him, all the earth: the world also shall be stable, that it be not moved.
 <span class="verse"> 31</span><a name="C16V31">&nbsp;</a>Let the heavens be glad, and let the earth rejoice: and let
<span class="add">men
</span> say among the nations, The LORD reigneth.
 <span class="verse"> 32</span><a name="C16V32">&nbsp;</a>Let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof: let the fields rejoice, and all that
<span class="add">is</span> therein.
 <span class="verse"> 33</span><a name="C16V33">&nbsp;</a>Then shall the trees of the wood sing out at the presence of the LORD, because he cometh to judge the
earth.
 <span class="verse"> 34</span><a name="C16V34">&nbsp;</a>O give thanks unto the LORD; for
<span class="add">he is</span> good; for his mercy
<span class="add">endureth</span> for ever.
 <span class="verse"> 35</span><a name="C16V35">&nbsp;</a>And say ye, Save us, O God of our salvation, and gather us together, and deliver us from the heathen,
that we may give thanks to thy holy name,
<span class="add">and</span> glory in thy praise.
 <span class="verse"> 36</span><a name="C16V36">&nbsp;</a>Blessed
<span class="add">be</span> the LORD God of Israel for ever and ever. And all the people said, Amen, and praised the LORD.

<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 37</span><a name="C16V37">&nbsp;</a>So he left there before the ark of the covenant of the LORD Asaph and his brethren, to minister before
the ark continually, as every day’s work required:
 <span class="verse"> 38</span><a name="C16V38">&nbsp;</a>And Obed- edom with their brethren, threescore and eight; Obed-edom also the son of Jeduthun and Hosah
<span class="add">to be</span> porters:
 <span class="verse"> 39</span><a name="C16V39">&nbsp;</a>And Zadok the priest, and his brethren the priests, before the tabernacle of the LORD in the high place
that
<span class="add">was</span> at Gibeon,
 <span class="verse"> 40</span><a name="C16V40">&nbsp;</a>To offer burnt offerings unto the LORD upon the altar of the burnt offering continually morning and evening,
and
<span class="add">to do</span> according to all that is written in the law of the LORD, which he commanded Israel;
 <span class="verse"> 41</span><a name="C16V41">&nbsp;</a>And with them Heman and Jeduthun, and the rest that were chosen, who were expressed by name, to give
thanks to the LORD, because his mercy
<span class="add">endureth</span> for ever;
 <span class="verse"> 42</span><a name="C16V42">&nbsp;</a>And with them Heman and Jeduthun with trumpets and cymbals for those that should make a sound, and with
musical instruments of God. And the sons of Jeduthun
<span class="add">were</span> porters.
 <span class="verse"> 43</span><a name="C16V43">&nbsp;</a>And all the people departed every man to his house: and David returned to bless his house.
