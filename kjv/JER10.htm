 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C10V1">&nbsp;</a>Hear ye the word which the LORD speaketh unto you, O house of Israel:
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C10V2">&nbsp;</a>Thus saith the LORD, Learn not the way of the heathen, and be not dismayed at the signs of heaven; for
the heathen are dismayed at them.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C10V3">&nbsp;</a>For the customs of the people
<span class="add">are</span> vain: for
<span class="add">one</span> cutteth a tree out of the forest, the work of the hands of the workman, with the axe.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C10V4">&nbsp;</a>They deck it with silver and with gold; they fasten it with nails and with hammers, that it move not.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C10V5">&nbsp;</a>They
<span class="add">are</span> upright as the palm tree, but speak not: they must needs be borne, because they cannot go. Be not afraid
of them; for they cannot do evil, neither also
<span class="add">is it</span> in them to do good.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C10V6">&nbsp;</a>Forasmuch as
<span class="add">there is</span> none like unto thee, O LORD; thou
<span class="add">art</span> great, and thy name is great in might.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C10V7">&nbsp;</a>Who would not fear thee, O King of nations? for to thee doth it appertain: forasmuch as among all the
wise
<span class="add">men</span> of the nations, and in all their kingdoms,
<span class="add">there is</span> none like unto thee.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C10V8">&nbsp;</a>But they are altogether brutish and foolish: the stock
<span class="add">is</span> a doctrine of vanities.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C10V9">&nbsp;</a>Silver spread into plates is brought from Tarshish, and gold from Uphaz, the work of the workman, and
of the hands of the founder: blue and purple is their clothing: they
<span class="add">are</span> all the work of cunning
<span class="add">men.
</span> <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C10V10">&nbsp;</a>But the LORD
<span class="add">is</span> the true God, he
<span class="add">is</span> the living God, and an everlasting king: at his wrath the earth shall tremble, and the nations shall
not be able to abide his indignation.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C10V11">&nbsp;</a>Thus shall ye say unto them, The gods that have not made the heavens and the earth,
<span class="add">even</span> they shall perish from the earth, and from under these heavens.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C10V12">&nbsp;</a>He hath made the earth by his power, he hath established the world by his wisdom, and hath stretched
out the heavens by his discretion.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C10V13">&nbsp;</a>When he uttereth his voice,
<span class="add">there is</span> a multitude of waters in the heavens, and he causeth the vapors to ascend from the ends of the earth;
he maketh lightnings with rain, and bringeth forth the wind out of his treasures.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C10V14">&nbsp;</a>Every man is brutish in
<span class="add">his</span> knowledge: every founder is confounded by the graven image: for his molten image is falsehood, and
<span class="add">there is</span> no breath in them.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C10V15">&nbsp;</a>They
<span class="add">are</span> vanity,
<span class="add">and</span> the work of errors: in the time of their visitation they shall perish.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C10V16">&nbsp;</a>The portion of Jacob
<span class="add">is</span> not like them: for he
<span class="add">is</span> the former of all
<span class="add">things;</span> and Israel
<span class="add">is</span> the rod of his inheritance: The LORD of hosts
<span class="add">is</span> his name.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C10V17">&nbsp;</a>Gather up thy wares out of the land, O inhabitant of the fortress.
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C10V18">&nbsp;</a>For thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will sling out the inhabitants of the land at this once, and will
distress them, that they may find
<span class="add">it</span> so.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C10V19">&nbsp;</a>Woe is me for my hurt! my wound is grievous: but I said, Truly this
<span class="add">is</span> a grief, and I must bear it.
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C10V20">&nbsp;</a>My tabernacle is spoiled, and all my cords are broken: my children are gone forth of me, and they
<span class="add">are</span> not:
<span class="add">there is</span> none to stretch forth my tent any more, and to set up my curtains.
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C10V21">&nbsp;</a>For the pastors are become brutish, and have not sought the LORD: therefore they shall not prosper, and
all their flocks shall be scattered.
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C10V22">&nbsp;</a>Behold, the noise of the bruit is come, and a great commotion out of the north country, to make the cities
of Judah desolate,
<span class="add">and</span> a den of dragons.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C10V23">&nbsp;</a>O LORD, I know that the way of man
<span class="add">is</span> not in himself:
<span class="add">it is</span> not in man that walketh to direct his steps.
 <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C10V24">&nbsp;</a>O LORD, correct me, but with judgment; not in thine anger, lest thou bring me to nothing.
 <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C10V25">&nbsp;</a>Pour out thy fury upon the heathen that know thee not, and upon the families that call not on thy name:
for they have eaten up Jacob, and devoured him, and consumed him, and have made his habitation desolate.
