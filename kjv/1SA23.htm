 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C23V1">&nbsp;</a>Then they told David, saying, Behold, the Philistines fight against Keilah, and they rob the threshingfloors.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C23V2">&nbsp;</a>Therefore David enquired of the LORD, saying, Shall I go and smite these Philistines? And the LORD said
unto David, Go, and smite the Philistines, and save Keilah.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C23V3">&nbsp;</a>And David’s men said unto him, Behold, we be afraid here in Judah: how much more then if we come to Keilah
against the armies of the Philistines?
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C23V4">&nbsp;</a>Then David enquired of the LORD yet again. And the LORD answered him and said, Arise, go down to Keilah;
for I will deliver the Philistines into thine hand.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C23V5">&nbsp;</a>So David and his men went to Keilah, and fought with the Philistines, and brought away their cattle,
and smote them with a great slaughter. So David saved the inhabitants of Keilah.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C23V6">&nbsp;</a>And it came to pass, when Abiathar the son of Ahimelech fled to David to Keilah,
<span class="add">that</span> he came down
<span class="add">with</span> an ephod in his hand.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C23V7">&nbsp;</a>And it was told Saul that David was come to Keilah. And Saul said, God hath delivered him into mine hand;
for he is shut in, by entering into a town that hath gates and bars.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C23V8">&nbsp;</a>And Saul called all the people together to war, to go down to Keilah, to besiege David and his men.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C23V9">&nbsp;</a>And David knew that Saul secretly practised mischief against him; and he said to Abiathar the priest,
Bring hither the ephod.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C23V10">&nbsp;</a>Then said David, O LORD God of Israel, thy servant hath certainly heard that Saul seeketh to come to
Keilah, to destroy the city for my sake.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C23V11">&nbsp;</a>Will the men of Keilah deliver me up into his hand? will Saul come down, as thy servant hath heard? O
LORD God of Israel, I beseech thee, tell thy servant. And the LORD said, He will come down.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C23V12">&nbsp;</a>Then said David, Will the men of Keilah deliver me and my men into the hand of Saul? And the LORD said,
They will deliver
<span class="add">thee</span> up.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C23V13">&nbsp;</a>Then David and his men,
<span class="add">which were</span> about six hundred, arose and departed out of Keilah, and went whithersoever they could go. And it was
told Saul that David was escaped from Keilah; and he forbare to go forth.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C23V14">&nbsp;</a>And David abode in the wilderness in strong holds, and remained in a mountain in the wilderness of Ziph.
And Saul sought him every day, but God delivered him not into his hand.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C23V15">&nbsp;</a>And David saw that Saul was come out to seek his life: and David
<span class="add">was</span> in the wilderness of Ziph in a wood.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C23V16">&nbsp;</a>And Jonathan Saul’s son arose, and went to David into the wood, and strengthened his hand in God.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C23V17">&nbsp;</a>And he said unto him, Fear not: for the hand of Saul my father shall not find thee; and thou shalt be
king over Israel, and I shall be next unto thee; and that also Saul my father knoweth.
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C23V18">&nbsp;</a>And they two made a covenant before the LORD: and David abode in the wood, and Jonathan went to his house.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C23V19">&nbsp;</a>Then came up the Ziphites to Saul to Gibeah, saying, Doth not David hide himself with us in strong holds
in the wood, in the hill of Hachilah, which
<span class="add">is</span> on the south of Jeshimon?
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C23V20">&nbsp;</a>Now therefore, O king, come down according to all the desire of thy soul to come down; and our part
<span class="add">shall be</span> to deliver him into the king’s hand.
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C23V21">&nbsp;</a>And Saul said, Blessed
<span class="add">be</span> ye of the LORD; for ye have compassion on me.
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C23V22">&nbsp;</a>Go, I pray you, prepare yet, and know and see his place where his haunt is,
<span class="add">and</span> who hath seen him there: for it is told me
<span class="add">that</span> he dealeth very subtilly.
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C23V23">&nbsp;</a>See therefore, and take knowledge of all the lurking places where he hideth himself, and come ye again
to me with the certainty, and I will go with you: and it shall come to pass, if he be in the land, that
I will search him out throughout all the thousands of Judah.
 <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C23V24">&nbsp;</a>And they arose, and went to Ziph before Saul: but David and his men
<span class="add">were</span> in the wilderness of Maon, in the plain on the south of Jeshimon.
 <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C23V25">&nbsp;</a>Saul also and his men went to seek
<span class="add">him.</span> And they told David: wherefore he came down into a rock, and abode in the wilderness of Maon. And when
Saul heard
<span class="add">that,</span> he pursued after David in the wilderness of Maon.
 <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C23V26">&nbsp;</a>And Saul went on this side of the mountain, and David and his men on that side of the mountain: and David
made haste to get away for fear of Saul; for Saul and his men compassed David and his men round about
to take them.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C23V27">&nbsp;</a>But there came a messenger unto Saul, saying, Haste thee, and come; for the Philistines have invaded
the land.
 <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C23V28">&nbsp;</a>Wherefore Saul returned from pursuing after David, and went against the Philistines: therefore they called
that place Sela-hammahlekoth.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C23V29">&nbsp;</a>And David went up from thence, and dwelt in strong holds at En-gedi.
