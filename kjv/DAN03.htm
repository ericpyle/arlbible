 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C3V1">&nbsp;</a>Nebuchadnezzar the king made an image of gold, whose height
<span class="add">was
</span> threescore cubits,
<span class="add">and</span> the breadth thereof six cubits: he set it up in the plain of Dura, in the province of Babylon.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C3V2">&nbsp;</a>Then Nebuchadnezzar the king sent to gather together the princes, the governors, and the captains, the
judges, the treasurers, the counsellors, the sheriffs, and all the rulers of the provinces, to come to
the dedication of the image which Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C3V3">&nbsp;</a>Then the princes, the governors, and captains, the judges, the treasurers, the counsellors, the sheriffs,
and all the rulers of the provinces, were gathered together unto the dedication of the image that Nebuchadnezzar
the king had set up; and they stood before the image that Nebuchadnezzar had set up.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C3V4">&nbsp;</a>Then an herald cried aloud, To you it is commanded, O people, nations, and languages,
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C3V5">&nbsp;</a><span class="add">That</span> at what time ye hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, dulcimer, and all kinds
of musick, ye fall down and worship the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king hath set up:
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C3V6">&nbsp;</a>And whoso falleth not down and worshippeth shall the same hour be cast into the midst of a burning fiery
furnace.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C3V7">&nbsp;</a>Therefore at that time, when all the people heard the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery,
and all kinds of musick, all the people, the nations, and the languages, fell down
<span class="add">and</span> worshipped the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C3V8">&nbsp;</a>Wherefore at that time certain Chaldeans came near, and accused the Jews.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C3V9">&nbsp;</a>They spake and said to the king Nebuchadnezzar, O king, live for ever.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C3V10">&nbsp;</a>Thou, O king, hast made a decree, that every man that shall hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp,
sackbut, psaltery, and dulcimer, and all kinds of musick, shall fall down and worship the golden image:
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C3V11">&nbsp;</a>And whoso falleth not down and worshippeth,
<span class="add">that</span> he should be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C3V12">&nbsp;</a>There are certain Jews whom thou hast set over the affairs of the province of Babylon, Shadrach, Meshach,
and Abed-nego; these men, O king, have not regarded thee: they serve not thy gods, nor worship the golden
image which thou hast set up.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C3V13">&nbsp;</a>Then Nebuchadnezzar in
<span class="add">his</span> rage and fury commanded to bring Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego. Then they brought these men before
the king.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C3V14">&nbsp;</a>Nebuchadnezzar spake and said unto them,
<span class="add">Is it</span> true, O Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, do not ye serve my gods, nor worship the golden image which
I have set up?
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C3V15">&nbsp;</a>Now if ye be ready that at what time ye hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery,
and dulcimer, and all kinds of musick, ye fall down and worship the image which I have made;
<span class="add">well:</span> but if ye worship not, ye shall be cast the same hour into the midst of a burning fiery furnace; and
who
<span class="add">is</span> that God that shall deliver you out of my hands?
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C3V16">&nbsp;</a>Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, answered and said to the king, O Nebuchadnezzar, we
<span class="add">are</span> not careful to answer thee in this matter.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C3V17">&nbsp;</a>If it be
<span class="add">so,</span> our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace, and he will deliver
<span class="add">us</span> out of thine hand, O king.
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C3V18">&nbsp;</a>But if not, be it known unto thee, O king, that we will not serve thy gods, nor worship the golden image
which thou hast set up.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C3V19">&nbsp;</a>Then was Nebuchadnezzar full of fury, and the form of his visage was changed against Shadrach, Meshach,
and Abed-nego:
<span class="add">therefore</span> he spake, and commanded that they should heat the furnace one seven times more than it was wont to be
heated.
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C3V20">&nbsp;</a>And he commanded the most mighty men that
<span class="add">were</span> in his army to bind Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego,
<span class="add">and</span> to cast
<span class="add">them
</span> into the burning fiery furnace.
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C3V21">&nbsp;</a>Then these men were bound in their coats, their hosen, and their hats, and their
<span class="add">other</span> garments, and were cast into the midst of the burning fiery furnace.
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C3V22">&nbsp;</a>Therefore because the king’s commandment was urgent, and the furnace exceeding hot, the flame of the
fire slew those men that took up Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed- nego.
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C3V23">&nbsp;</a>And these three men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, fell down bound into the midst of the burning
fiery furnace.
 <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C3V24">&nbsp;</a>Then Nebuchadnezzar the king was astonied, and rose up in haste,
<span class="add">and</span> spake, and said unto his counsellors, Did not we cast three men bound into the midst of the fire? They
answered and said unto the king, True, O king.
 <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C3V25">&nbsp;</a>He answered and said, Lo, I see four men loose, walking in the midst of the fire, and they have no hurt;
and the form of the fourth is like the Son of God.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C3V26">&nbsp;</a>Then Nebuchadnezzar came near to the mouth of the burning fiery furnace,
<span class="add">and</span> spake, and said, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, ye servants of the most high God, come forth, and
come
<span class="add">hither.</span> Then Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, came forth of the midst of the fire.
 <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C3V27">&nbsp;</a>And the princes, governors, and captains, and the king’s counsellors, being gathered together, saw these
men, upon whose bodies the fire had no power, nor was an hair of their head singed, neither were their
coats changed, nor the smell of fire had passed on them.
 <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C3V28">&nbsp;</a><span class="add">Then</span> Nebuchadnezzar spake, and said, Blessed
<span class="add">be
</span> the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, who hath sent his angel, and delivered his servants that
trusted in him, and have changed the king’s word, and yielded their bodies, that they might not serve
nor worship any god, except their own God.
 <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C3V29">&nbsp;</a>Therefore I make a decree, That every people, nation, and language, which speak any thing amiss against
the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, shall be cut in pieces, and their houses shall be made a
dunghill: because there is no other God that can deliver after this sort.
 <span class="verse"> 30</span><a name="C3V30">&nbsp;</a>Then the king promoted Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, in the province of Babylon.
