 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C6V1">&nbsp;</a>Therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ, let us go on unto perfection; not laying
again the foundation of repentance from dead works, and of faith toward God,
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C6V2">&nbsp;</a>Of the doctrine of baptisms, and of laying on of hands, and of resurrection of the dead, and of eternal
judgment.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C6V3">&nbsp;</a>And this will we do, if God permit.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C6V4">&nbsp;</a>For
<span class="add">it is</span> impossible for those who were once enlightened, and have tasted of the heavenly gift, and were made
partakers of the Holy Ghost,
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C6V5">&nbsp;</a>And have tasted the good word of God, and the powers of the world to come,
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C6V6">&nbsp;</a>If they shall fall away, to renew them again unto repentance; seeing they crucify to themselves the Son
of God afresh, and put
<span class="add">him</span> to an open shame.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C6V7">&nbsp;</a>For the earth which drinketh in the rain that cometh oft upon it, and bringeth forth herbs meet for them
by whom it is dressed, receiveth blessing from God:
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C6V8">&nbsp;</a>But that which beareth thorns and briers
<span class="add">is</span> rejected, and
<span class="add">is</span> nigh unto cursing; whose end
<span class="add">is</span> to be burned.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C6V9">&nbsp;</a>But, beloved, we are persuaded better things of you, and things that accompany salvation, though we thus
speak.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C6V10">&nbsp;</a>For God
<span class="add">is</span> not unrighteous to forget your work and labour of love, which ye have shewed toward his name, in that
ye have ministered to the saints, and do minister.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C6V11">&nbsp;</a>And we desire that every one of you do shew the same diligence to the full assurance of hope unto the
end:
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C6V12">&nbsp;</a>That ye be not slothful, but followers of them who through faith and patience inherit the promises.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C6V13">&nbsp;</a>For when God made promise to Abraham, because he could swear by no greater, he sware by himself,
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C6V14">&nbsp;</a>Saying, Surely blessing I will bless thee, and multiplying I will multiply thee.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C6V15">&nbsp;</a>And so, after he had patiently endured, he obtained the promise.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C6V16">&nbsp;</a>For men verily swear by the greater: and an oath for confirmation
<span class="add">is</span> to them an end of all strife.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C6V17">&nbsp;</a>Wherein God, willing more abundantly to shew unto the heirs of promise the immutability of his counsel,
confirmed
<span class="add">it</span> by an oath:
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C6V18">&nbsp;</a>That by two immutable things, in which
<span class="add">it was</span> impossible for God to lie, we might have a strong consolation, who have fled for refuge to lay hold
upon the hope set before us:
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C6V19">&nbsp;</a>Which
<span class="add">hope</span> we have as an anchor of the soul, both sure and stedfast, and which entereth into that within the veil;
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C6V20">&nbsp;</a>Whither the forerunner is for us entered,
<span class="add">even</span> Jesus, made an high priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec.
