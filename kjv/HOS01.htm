 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C1V1">&nbsp;</a>The word of the LORD that came unto Hosea, the son of Beeri, in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz,
<span class="add">and</span> Hezekiah, kings of Judah, and in the days of Jeroboam the son of Joash, king of Israel.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C1V2">&nbsp;</a>The beginning of the word of the LORD by Hosea. And the LORD said to Hosea, Go, take unto thee a wife
of whoredoms and children of whoredoms: for the land hath committed great whoredom,
<span class="add">departing</span> from the LORD.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C1V3">&nbsp;</a>So he went and took Gomer the daughter of Diblaim; which conceived, and bare him a son.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C1V4">&nbsp;</a>And the LORD said unto him, Call his name Jezreel; for yet a little
<span class="add">while,</span> and I will avenge the blood of Jezreel upon the house of Jehu, and will cause to cease the kingdom of
the house of Israel.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C1V5">&nbsp;</a>And it shall come to pass at that day, that I will break the bow of Israel in the valley of Jezreel.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C1V6">&nbsp;</a>And she conceived again, and bare a daughter. And
<span class="add">God</span> said unto him, Call her name Lo-ruhamah: for I will no more have mercy upon the house of Israel; but
I will utterly take them away.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C1V7">&nbsp;</a>But I will have mercy upon the house of Judah, and will save them by the LORD their God, and will not
save them by bow, nor by sword, nor by battle, by horses, nor by horsemen.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C1V8">&nbsp;</a>Now when she had weaned Lo-ruhamah, she conceived, and bare a son.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C1V9">&nbsp;</a>Then said
<span class="add">God,</span> Call his name Lo-ammi: for ye
<span class="add">are</span> not my people, and I will not be your
<span class="add">God.</span></div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C1V10">&nbsp;</a>Yet the number of the children of Israel shall be as the sand of the sea, which cannot be measured nor
numbered; and it shall come to pass,
<span class="add">that</span> in the place where it was said unto them, Ye
<span class="add">are</span> not my people,
<span class="add">there</span> it shall be said unto them,
<span class="add">Ye are</span> the sons of the living God.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C1V11">&nbsp;</a>Then shall the children of Judah and the children of Israel be gathered together, and appoint themselves
one head, and they shall come up out of the land: for great
<span class="add">shall be</span> the day of Jezreel.
