 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C2V1">&nbsp;</a>He that dasheth in pieces is come up before thy face: keep the munition, watch the way, make
<span class="add">thy</span> loins strong, fortify
<span class="add">thy</span> power mightily.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C2V2">&nbsp;</a>For the LORD hath turned away the excellency of Jacob, as the excellency of Israel: for the emptiers
have emptied them out, and marred their vine branches.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C2V3">&nbsp;</a>The shield of his mighty men is made red, the valiant men
<span class="add">are
</span> in scarlet: the chariots
<span class="add">shall be</span> with flaming torches in the day of his preparation, and the fir trees shall be terribly shaken.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C2V4">&nbsp;</a>The chariots shall rage in the streets, they shall justle one against another in the broad ways: they
shall seem like torches, they shall run like the lightnings.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C2V5">&nbsp;</a>He shall recount his worthies: they shall stumble in their walk; they shall make haste to the wall thereof,
and the defence shall be prepared.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C2V6">&nbsp;</a>The gates of the rivers shall be opened, and the palace shall be dissolved.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C2V7">&nbsp;</a>And Huzzab shall be led away captive, she shall be brought up, and her maids shall lead
<span class="add">her</span> as with the voice of doves, tabering upon their breasts.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C2V8">&nbsp;</a>But Nineveh is of old like a pool of water: yet they shall flee away. Stand, stand,
<span class="add">shall they cry;</span> but none shall look back.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C2V9">&nbsp;</a>Take ye the spoil of silver, take the spoil of gold: for
<span class="add">there is
</span> none end of the store
<span class="add">and</span> glory out of all the pleasant furniture.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C2V10">&nbsp;</a>She is empty, and void, and waste: and the heart melteth, and the knees smite together, and much pain
<span class="add">is</span> in all loins, and the faces of them all gather blackness.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C2V11">&nbsp;</a>Where
<span class="add">is</span> the dwelling of the lions, and the feeding place of the young lions, where the lion,
<span class="add">even</span> the old lion, walked,
<span class="add">and</span> the lion’s whelp, and none made
<span class="add">them</span> afraid?
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C2V12">&nbsp;</a>The lion did tear in pieces enough for his whelps, and strangled for his lionesses, and filled his holes
with prey, and his dens with ravin.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C2V13">&nbsp;</a>Behold, I
<span class="add">am</span> against thee, saith the LORD of hosts, and I will burn her chariots in the smoke, and the sword shall
devour thy young lions: and I will cut off thy prey from the earth, and the voice of thy messengers shall
no more be heard.
