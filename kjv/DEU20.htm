 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C20V1">&nbsp;</a>When thou goest out to battle against thine enemies, and seest horses, and chariots,
<span class="add">and</span> a people more than thou, be not afraid of them: for the LORD thy God
<span class="add">is</span> with thee, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C20V2">&nbsp;</a>And it shall be, when ye are come nigh unto the battle, that the priest shall approach and speak unto
the people,
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C20V3">&nbsp;</a>And shall say unto them, Hear, O Israel, ye approach this day unto battle against your enemies: let not
your hearts faint, fear not, and do not tremble, neither be ye terrified because of them;
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C20V4">&nbsp;</a>For the LORD your God
<span class="add">is</span> he that goeth with you, to fight for you against your enemies, to save you.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C20V5">&nbsp;</a>And the officers shall speak unto the people, saying, What man
<span class="add">is there</span> that hath built a new house, and hath not dedicated it? let him go and return to his house, lest he
die in the battle, and another man dedicate it.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C20V6">&nbsp;</a>And what man
<span class="add">is he</span> that hath planted a vineyard, and hath not
<span class="add">yet</span> eaten of it? let him
<span class="add">also</span> go and return unto his house, lest he die in the battle, and another man eat of it.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C20V7">&nbsp;</a>And what man
<span class="add">is there</span> that hath betrothed a wife, and hath not taken her? let him go and return unto his house, lest he die
in the battle, and another man take her.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C20V8">&nbsp;</a>And the officers shall speak further unto the people, and they shall say, What man
<span class="add">is there that is</span> fearful and fainthearted? let him go and return unto his house, lest his brethren’s heart faint as well
as his heart.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C20V9">&nbsp;</a>And it shall be, when the officers have made an end of speaking unto the people, that they shall make
captains of the armies to lead the people.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C20V10">&nbsp;</a>When thou comest nigh unto a city to fight against it, then proclaim peace unto it.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C20V11">&nbsp;</a>And it shall be, if it make thee answer of peace, and open unto thee, then it shall be,
<span class="add">that</span> all the people
<span class="add">that is</span> found therein shall be tributaries unto thee, and they shall serve thee.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C20V12">&nbsp;</a>And if it will make no peace with thee, but will make war against thee, then thou shalt besiege it:
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C20V13">&nbsp;</a>And when the LORD thy God hath delivered it into thine hands, thou shalt smite every male thereof with
the edge of the sword:
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C20V14">&nbsp;</a>But the women, and the little ones, and the cattle, and all that is in the city,
<span class="add">even</span> all the spoil thereof, shalt thou take unto thyself; and thou shalt eat the spoil of thine enemies,
which the LORD thy God hath given thee.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C20V15">&nbsp;</a>Thus shalt thou do unto all the cities
<span class="add">which are</span> very far off from thee, which
<span class="add">are</span> not of the cities of these nations.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C20V16">&nbsp;</a>But of the cities of these people, which the LORD thy God doth give thee
<span class="add">for</span> an inheritance, thou shalt save alive nothing that breatheth:
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C20V17">&nbsp;</a>But thou shalt utterly destroy them;
<span class="add">namely,</span> the Hittites, and the Amorites, the Canaanites, and the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites;
as the LORD thy God hath commanded thee:
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C20V18">&nbsp;</a>That they teach you not to do after all their abominations, which they have done unto their gods; so
should ye sin against the LORD your God.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C20V19">&nbsp;</a>When thou shalt besiege a city a long time, in making war against it to take it, thou shalt not destroy
the trees thereof by forcing an axe against them: for thou mayest eat of them, and thou shalt not cut
them down (for the tree of the field
<span class="add">is</span> man’s
<span class="add">life</span>) to employ
<span class="add">them
</span> in the siege:
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C20V20">&nbsp;</a>Only the trees which thou knowest that they
<span class="add">be</span> not trees for meat, thou shalt destroy and cut them down; and thou shalt build bulwarks against the
city that maketh war with thee, until it be subdued.
