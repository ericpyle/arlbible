 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C17V1">&nbsp;</a>And there was a man of mount Ephraim, whose name
<span class="add">was</span> Micah.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C17V2">&nbsp;</a>And he said unto his mother, The eleven hundred
<span class="add">shekels</span> of silver that were taken from thee, about which thou cursedst, and spakest of also in mine ears, behold,
the silver is with me; I took it. And his mother said, Blessed
<span class="add">be thou</span> of the LORD, my son.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C17V3">&nbsp;</a>And when he had restored the eleven hundred
<span class="add">shekels</span> of silver to his mother, his mother said, I had wholly dedicated the silver unto the LORD from my hand
for my son, to make a graven image and a molten image: now therefore I will restore it unto thee.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C17V4">&nbsp;</a>Yet he restored the money unto his mother; and his mother took two hundred
<span class="add">shekels</span> of silver, and gave them to the founder, who made thereof a graven image and a molten image: and they
were in the house of Micah.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C17V5">&nbsp;</a>And the man Micah had an house of gods, and made an ephod, and teraphim, and consecrated one of his sons,
who became his priest.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C17V6">&nbsp;</a>In those days
<span class="add">there was</span> no king in Israel,
<span class="add">but</span> every man did
<span class="add">that which was</span> right in his own eyes.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C17V7">&nbsp;</a>And there was a young man out of Bethlehemjudah of the family of Judah, who
<span class="add">was</span> a Levite, and he sojourned there.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C17V8">&nbsp;</a>And the man departed out of the city from Bethlehemjudah to sojourn where he could find
<span class="add">a place:</span> and he came to mount Ephraim to the house of Micah, as he journeyed.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C17V9">&nbsp;</a>And Micah said unto him, Whence comest thou? And he said unto him, I
<span class="add">am</span> a Levite of Bethlehemjudah, and I go to sojourn where I may find
<span class="add">a place.
</span> <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C17V10">&nbsp;</a>And Micah said unto him, Dwell with me, and be unto me a father and a priest, and I will give thee ten
<span class="add">shekels</span> of silver by the year, and a suit of apparel, and thy victuals. So the Levite went in.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C17V11">&nbsp;</a>And the Levite was content to dwell with the man; and the young man was unto him as one of his sons.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C17V12">&nbsp;</a>And Micah consecrated the Levite; and the young man became his priest, and was in the house of Micah.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C17V13">&nbsp;</a>Then said Micah, Now know I that the LORD will do me good, seeing I have a Levite to
<span class="add">my</span> priest.
