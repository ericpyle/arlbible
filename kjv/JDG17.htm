 <span class="verse" id="V1">1&nbsp;</span>And there was a man of mount Ephraim, whose name <span class='add'>was</span> Micah.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span>And he said unto his mother, The eleven hundred <span class='add'>shekels</span> of silver that were taken from thee, about which thou cursedst, and spakest of also in mine ears, behold, the silver is with me; I took it. And his mother said, Blessed <span class='add'>be thou</span> of the LORD, my son.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>And when he had restored the eleven hundred <span class='add'>shekels</span> of silver to his mother, his mother said, I had wholly dedicated the silver unto the LORD from my hand for my son, to make a graven image and a molten image: now therefore I will restore it unto thee.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>Yet he restored the money unto his mother; and his mother took two hundred <span class='add'>shekels</span> of silver, and gave them to the founder, who made thereof a graven image and a molten image: and they were in the house of Micah.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>And the man Micah had an house of gods, and made an ephod, and teraphim, and consecrated one of his sons, who became his priest.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>In those days <span class='add'>there was</span> no king in Israel, <span class='add'>but</span> every man did <span class='add'>that which was</span> right in his own eyes. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>And there was a young man out of Bethlehemjudah of the family of Judah, who <span class='add'>was</span> a Levite, and he sojourned there.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>And the man departed out of the city from Bethlehemjudah to sojourn where he could find <span class='add'>a place:</span> and he came to mount Ephraim to the house of Micah, as he journeyed.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>And Micah said unto him, Whence comest thou? And he said unto him, I <span class='add'>am</span> a Levite of Bethlehemjudah, and I go to sojourn where I may find <span class='add'>a place</span>.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>And Micah said unto him, Dwell with me, and be unto me a father and a priest, and I will give thee ten <span class='add'>shekels</span> of silver by the year, and a suit of apparel, and thy victuals. So the Levite went in.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>And the Levite was content to dwell with the man; and the young man was unto him as one of his sons.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>And Micah consecrated the Levite; and the young man became his priest, and was in the house of Micah.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>Then said Micah, Now know I that the LORD will do me good, seeing I have a Levite to <span class='add'>my</span> priest. </div><ul class='tnav'>
