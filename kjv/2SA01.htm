 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C1V1">&nbsp;</a>Now it came to pass after the death of Saul, when David was returned from the slaughter of the Amalekites,
and David had abode two days in Ziklag;
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C1V2">&nbsp;</a>It came even to pass on the third day, that, behold, a man came out of the camp from Saul with his clothes
rent, and earth upon his head: and
<span class="add">so</span> it was, when he came to David, that he fell to the earth, and did obeisance.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C1V3">&nbsp;</a>And David said unto him, From whence comest thou? And he said unto him, Out of the camp of Israel am
I escaped.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C1V4">&nbsp;</a>And David said unto him, How went the matter? I pray thee, tell me. And he answered, That the people
are fled from the battle, and many of the people also are fallen and dead; and Saul and Jonathan his
son are dead also.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C1V5">&nbsp;</a>And David said unto the young man that told him, How knowest thou that Saul and Jonathan his son be dead?
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C1V6">&nbsp;</a>And the young man that told him said, As I happened by chance upon mount Gilboa, behold, Saul leaned
upon his spear; and, lo, the chariots and horsemen followed hard after him.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C1V7">&nbsp;</a>And when he looked behind him, he saw me, and called unto me. And I answered, Here
<span class="add">am</span> I.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C1V8">&nbsp;</a>And he said unto me, Who
<span class="add">art</span> thou? And I answered him, I
<span class="add">am</span> an Amalekite.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C1V9">&nbsp;</a>And he said unto me again, Stand, I pray thee, upon me, and slay me: for anguish is come upon me, because
my life
<span class="add">is</span> yet whole in me.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C1V10">&nbsp;</a>So I stood upon him, and slew him, because I was sure that he could not live after that he was fallen:
and I took the crown that
<span class="add">was</span> upon his head, and the bracelet that
<span class="add">was</span> on his arm, and have brought them hither unto my lord.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C1V11">&nbsp;</a>Then David took hold on his clothes, and rent them; and likewise all the men that
<span class="add">were</span> with him:
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C1V12">&nbsp;</a>And they mourned, and wept, and fasted until even, for Saul, and for Jonathan his son, and for the people
of the LORD, and for the house of Israel; because they were fallen by the sword.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C1V13">&nbsp;</a>And David said unto the young man that told him, Whence
<span class="add">art</span> thou? And he answered, I
<span class="add">am</span> the son of a stranger, an Amalekite.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C1V14">&nbsp;</a>And David said unto him, How wast thou not afraid to stretch forth thine hand to destroy the LORD’S anointed?
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C1V15">&nbsp;</a>And David called one of the young men, and said, Go near,
<span class="add">and</span> fall upon him. And he smote him that he died.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C1V16">&nbsp;</a>And David said unto him, Thy blood
<span class="add">be</span> upon thy head; for thy mouth hath testified against thee, saying, I have slain the LORD’S anointed.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C1V17">&nbsp;</a>And David lamented with this lamentation over Saul and over Jonathan his son:
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C1V18">&nbsp;</a>(Also he bade them teach the children of Judah
<span class="add">the use of</span> the bow: behold, it is written in the book of Jasher.)
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C1V19">&nbsp;</a>The beauty of Israel is slain upon thy high places: how are the mighty fallen!
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C1V20">&nbsp;</a>Tell
<span class="add">it</span> not in Gath, publish
<span class="add">it</span> not in the streets of Askelon; lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice, lest the daughters of
the uncircumcised triumph.
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C1V21">&nbsp;</a>Ye mountains of Gilboa,
<span class="add">let there be</span> no dew, neither
<span class="add">let there be</span> rain, upon you, nor fields of offerings: for there the shield of the mighty is vilely cast away, the
shield of Saul,
<span class="add">as though he had</span> not
<span class="add">been</span> anointed with oil.
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C1V22">&nbsp;</a>From the blood of the slain, from the fat of the mighty, the bow of Jonathan turned not back, and the
sword of Saul returned not empty.
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C1V23">&nbsp;</a>Saul and Jonathan
<span class="add">were</span> lovely and pleasant in their lives, and in their death they were not divided: they were swifter than
eagles, they were stronger than lions.
 <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C1V24">&nbsp;</a>Ye daughters of Israel, weep over Saul, who clothed you in scarlet, with
<span class="add">other</span> delights, who put on ornaments of gold upon your apparel.
 <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C1V25">&nbsp;</a>How are the mighty fallen in the midst of the battle! O Jonathan,
<span class="add">thou wast</span> slain in thine high places.
 <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C1V26">&nbsp;</a>I am distressed for thee, my brother Jonathan: very pleasant hast thou been unto me: thy love to me was
wonderful, passing the love of women.
 <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C1V27">&nbsp;</a>How are the mighty fallen, and the weapons of war perished!
