 <span class="verse" id="V1">1&nbsp;</span>Now it came to pass after the death of Saul, when David was returned from the slaughter of the Amalekites, and David had abode two days in Ziklag;  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span>It came even to pass on the third day, that, behold, a man came out of the camp from Saul with his clothes rent, and earth upon his head: and <span class='add'>so</span> it was, when he came to David, that he fell to the earth, and did obeisance.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>And David said unto him, From whence comest thou? And he said unto him, Out of the camp of Israel am I escaped.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>And David said unto him, How went the matter? I pray thee, tell me. And he answered, That the people are fled from the battle, and many of the people also are fallen and dead; and Saul and Jonathan his son are dead also.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>And David said unto the young man that told him, How knowest thou that Saul and Jonathan his son be dead?  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>And the young man that told him said, As I happened by chance upon mount Gilboa, behold, Saul leaned upon his spear; and, lo, the chariots and horsemen followed hard after him.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>And when he looked behind him, he saw me, and called unto me. And I answered, Here <span class='add'>am</span> I.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>And he said unto me, Who <span class='add'>art</span> thou? And I answered him, I <span class='add'>am</span> an Amalekite.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>And he said unto me again, Stand, I pray thee, upon me, and slay me: for anguish is come upon me, because my life <span class='add'>is</span> yet whole in me.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>So I stood upon him, and slew him, because I was sure that he could not live after that he was fallen: and I took the crown that <span class='add'>was</span> upon his head, and the bracelet that <span class='add'>was</span> on his arm, and have brought them hither unto my lord.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>Then David took hold on his clothes, and rent them; and likewise all the men that <span class='add'>were</span> with him:  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>And they mourned, and wept, and fasted until even, for Saul, and for Jonathan his son, and for the people of the LORD, and for the house of Israel; because they were fallen by the sword. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>And David said unto the young man that told him, Whence <span class='add'>art</span> thou? And he answered, I <span class='add'>am</span> the son of a stranger, an Amalekite.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>And David said unto him, How wast thou not afraid to stretch forth thine hand to destroy the LORD’s anointed?  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>And David called one of the young men, and said, Go near, <span class='add'>and</span> fall upon him. And he smote him that he died.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>And David said unto him, Thy blood <span class='add'>be</span> upon thy head; for thy mouth hath testified against thee, saying, I have slain the LORD’s anointed. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>And David lamented with this lamentation over Saul and over Jonathan his son:  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>(Also he bade them teach the children of Judah <span class='add'>the use of</span> the bow: behold, it is written in the book of Jasher.)  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>The beauty of Israel is slain upon thy high places: how are the mighty fallen!  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>Tell <span class='add'>it</span> not in Gath, publish <span class='add'>it</span> not in the streets of Askelon; lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice, lest the daughters of the uncircumcised triumph.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>Ye mountains of Gilboa, <span class='add'>let there be</span> no dew, neither <span class='add'>let there be</span> rain, upon you, nor fields of offerings: for there the shield of the mighty is vilely cast away, the shield of Saul, <span class='add'>as though he had</span> not <span class='add'>been</span> anointed with oil.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>From the blood of the slain, from the fat of the mighty, the bow of Jonathan turned not back, and the sword of Saul returned not empty.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>Saul and Jonathan <span class='add'>were</span> lovely and pleasant in their lives, and in their death they were not divided: they were swifter than eagles, they were stronger than lions.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>Ye daughters of Israel, weep over Saul, who clothed you in scarlet, with <span class='add'>other</span> delights, who put on ornaments of gold upon your apparel.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>How are the mighty fallen in the midst of the battle! O Jonathan, <span class='add'>thou wast</span> slain in thine high places.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>I am distressed for thee, my brother Jonathan: very pleasant hast thou been unto me: thy love to me was wonderful, passing the love of women.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>How are the mighty fallen, and the weapons of war perished! </div><ul class='tnav'>
