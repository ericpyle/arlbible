 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C2V1">&nbsp;</a>Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C2V2">&nbsp;</a>And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all
his work which he had made.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C2V3">&nbsp;</a>And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: because that in it he had rested from all his work
which God created and made.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C2V4">&nbsp;</a>These
<span class="add">are</span> the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created, in the day that the LORD God
made the earth and the heavens,
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C2V5">&nbsp;</a>And every plant of the field before it was in the earth, and every herb of the field before it grew:
for the LORD God had not caused it to rain upon the earth, and
<span class="add">there was</span> not a man to till the ground.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C2V6">&nbsp;</a>But there went up a mist from the earth, and watered the whole face of the ground.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C2V7">&nbsp;</a>And the LORD God formed man
<span class="add">of</span> the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C2V8">&nbsp;</a>And the LORD God planted a garden eastward in Eden; and there he put the man whom he had formed.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C2V9">&nbsp;</a>And out of the ground made the LORD God to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight, and good for
food; the tree of life also in the midst of the garden, and the tree of knowledge of good and evil.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C2V10">&nbsp;</a>And a river went out of Eden to water the garden; and from thence it was parted, and became into four
heads.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C2V11">&nbsp;</a>The name of the first
<span class="add">is</span> Pison: that
<span class="add">is</span> it which compasseth the whole land of Havilah, where
<span class="add">there is</span> gold;
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C2V12">&nbsp;</a>And the gold of that land
<span class="add">is</span> good: there
<span class="add">is</span> bdellium and the onyx stone.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C2V13">&nbsp;</a>And the name of the second river
<span class="add">is</span> Gihon: the same
<span class="add">is</span> it that compasseth the whole land of Ethiopia.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C2V14">&nbsp;</a>And the name of the third river
<span class="add">is</span> Hiddekel: that
<span class="add">is</span> it which goeth toward the east of Assyria. And the fourth river
<span class="add">is</span> Euphrates.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C2V15">&nbsp;</a>And the LORD God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C2V16">&nbsp;</a>And the LORD God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat:
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C2V17">&nbsp;</a>But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou
eatest thereof thou shalt surely die.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C2V18">&nbsp;</a>And the LORD God said,
<span class="add">It is</span> not good that the man should be alone; I will make him an help meet for him.
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C2V19">&nbsp;</a>And out of the ground the LORD God formed every beast of the field, and every fowl of the air; and brought
<span class="add">them</span> unto Adam to see what he would call them: and whatsoever Adam called every living creature, that
<span class="add">was</span> the name thereof.
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C2V20">&nbsp;</a>And Adam gave names to all cattle, and to the fowl of the air, and to every beast of the field; but for
Adam there was not found an help meet for him.
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C2V21">&nbsp;</a>And the LORD God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam and he slept: and he took one of his ribs, and
closed up the flesh instead thereof;
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C2V22">&nbsp;</a>And the rib, which the LORD God had taken from man, made he a woman, and brought her unto the man.
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C2V23">&nbsp;</a>And Adam said, This
<span class="add">is</span> now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh: she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of
Man.
 <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C2V24">&nbsp;</a>Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall
be one flesh.
 <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C2V25">&nbsp;</a>And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not ashamed.
