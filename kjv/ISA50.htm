Behold, for your iniquities have ye sold yourselves, and for your transgressions is your mother put away.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span>Wherefore, when I came, <span class='add'>was there</span> no man? when I called, <span class='add'>was there</span> none to answer? Is my hand shortened at all, that it cannot redeem? or have I no power to deliver? behold, at my rebuke I dry up the sea, I make the rivers a wilderness: their fish stinketh, because <span class='add'>there is</span> no water, and dieth for thirst.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>I clothe the heavens with blackness, and I make sackcloth their covering.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>The Lord GOD hath given me the tongue of the learned, that I should know how to speak a word in season to <span class='add'>him that is</span> weary: he wakeneth morning by morning, he wakeneth mine ear to hear as the learned. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>The Lord GOD hath opened mine ear, and I was not rebellious, neither turned away back.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>I gave my back to the smiters, and my cheeks to them that plucked off the hair: I hid not my face from shame and spitting. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>For the Lord GOD will help me; therefore shall I not be confounded: therefore have I set my face like a flint, and I know that I shall not be ashamed.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span> <span class='add'>He is</span> near that justifieth me; who will contend with me? let us stand together: who <span class='add'>is</span> mine adversary? let him come near to me.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>Behold, the Lord GOD will help me; who <span class='add'>is</span> he <span class='add'>that</span> shall condemn me? lo, they all shall wax old as a garment; the moth shall eat them up. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>Who <span class='add'>is</span> among you that feareth the LORD, that obeyeth the voice of his servant, that walketh <span class='add'>in</span> darkness, and hath no light? let him trust in the name of the LORD, and stay upon his God.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>Behold, all ye that kindle a fire, that compass <span class='add'>yourselves</span> about with sparks: walk in the light of your fire, and in the sparks <span class='add'>that</span> ye have kindled.
