 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C15V1">&nbsp;</a>And it came to pass after this, that Absalom prepared him chariots and horses, and fifty men to run before
him.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C15V2">&nbsp;</a>And Absalom rose up early, and stood beside the way of the gate: and it was so, that when any man that
had a controversy came to the king for judgment, then Absalom called unto him, and said, Of what city
<span class="add">art</span> thou? And he said, Thy servant is of one of the tribes of Israel.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C15V3">&nbsp;</a>And Absalom said unto him, See, thy matters
<span class="add">are</span> good and right; but
<span class="add">there is</span> no man
<span class="add">deputed</span> of the king to hear thee.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C15V4">&nbsp;</a>Absalom said moreover, Oh that I were made judge in the land, that every man which hath any suit or cause
might come unto me, and I would do him justice!
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C15V5">&nbsp;</a>And it was
<span class="add">so,</span> that when any man came nigh
<span class="add">to him</span> to do him obeisance, he put forth his hand, and took him, and kissed him.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C15V6">&nbsp;</a>And on this manner did Absalom to all Israel that came to the king for judgment: so Absalom stole the
hearts of the men of Israel.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C15V7">&nbsp;</a>And it came to pass after forty years, that Absalom said unto the king, I pray thee, let me go and pay
my vow, which I have vowed unto the LORD, in Hebron.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C15V8">&nbsp;</a>For thy servant vowed a vow while I abode at Geshur in Syria, saying, If the LORD shall bring me again
indeed to Jerusalem, then I will serve the LORD.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C15V9">&nbsp;</a>And the king said unto him, Go in peace. So he arose, and went to Hebron.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C15V10">&nbsp;</a>But Absalom sent spies throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, As soon as ye hear the sound of the
trumpet, then ye shall say, Absalom reigneth in Hebron.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C15V11">&nbsp;</a>And with Absalom went two hundred men out of Jerusalem,
<span class="add">that were</span> called; and they went in their simplicity, and they knew not any thing.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C15V12">&nbsp;</a>And Absalom sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite, David’s counsellor, from his city,
<span class="add">even</span> from Giloh, while he offered sacrifices. And the conspiracy was strong; for the people increased continually
with Absalom.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C15V13">&nbsp;</a>And there came a messenger to David, saying, The hearts of the men of Israel are after Absalom.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C15V14">&nbsp;</a>And David said unto all his servants that
<span class="add">were</span> with him at Jerusalem, Arise, and let us flee; for we shall not
<span class="add">else</span> escape from Absalom: make speed to depart, lest he overtake us suddenly, and bring evil upon us, and
smite the city with the edge of the sword.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C15V15">&nbsp;</a>And the king’s servants said unto the king, Behold, thy servants
<span class="add">are ready to do</span> whatsoever my lord the king shall appoint.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C15V16">&nbsp;</a>And the king went forth, and all his household after him. And the king left ten women,
<span class="add">which were</span> concubines, to keep the house.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C15V17">&nbsp;</a>And the king went forth, and all the people after him, and tarried in a place that was far off.
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C15V18">&nbsp;</a>And all his servants passed on beside him; and all the Cherethites, and all the Pelethites, and all the
Gittites, six hundred men which came after him from Gath, passed on before the king.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C15V19">&nbsp;</a>Then said the king to Ittai the Gittite, Wherefore goest thou also with us? return to thy place, and
abide with the king: for thou
<span class="add">art</span> a stranger, and also an exile.
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C15V20">&nbsp;</a>Whereas thou camest
<span class="add">but</span> yesterday, should I this day make thee go up and down with us? seeing I go whither I may, return thou,
and take back thy brethren: mercy and truth
<span class="add">be</span> with thee.
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C15V21">&nbsp;</a>And Ittai answered the king, and said,
<span class="add">As</span> the LORD liveth, and
<span class="add">as</span> my lord the king liveth, surely in what place my lord the king shall be, whether in death or life, even
there also will thy servant be.
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C15V22">&nbsp;</a>And David said to Ittai, Go and pass over. And Ittai the Gittite passed over, and all his men, and all
the little ones that
<span class="add">were</span> with him.
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C15V23">&nbsp;</a>And all the country wept with a loud voice, and all the people passed over: the king also himself passed
over the brook Kidron, and all the people passed over, toward the way of the wilderness.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C15V24">&nbsp;</a>And lo Zadok also, and all the Levites
<span class="add">were</span> with him, bearing the ark of the covenant of God: and they set down the ark of God; and Abiathar went
up, until all the people had done passing out of the city.
 <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C15V25">&nbsp;</a>And the king said unto Zadok, Carry back the ark of God into the city: if I shall find favour in the
eyes of the LORD, he will bring me again, and shew me
<span class="add">both</span> it, and his habitation:
 <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C15V26">&nbsp;</a>But if he thus say, I have no delight in thee; behold,
<span class="add">here am</span> I, let him do to me as seemeth good unto him.
 <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C15V27">&nbsp;</a>The king said also unto Zadok the priest,
<span class="add">Art not</span> thou a seer? return into the city in peace, and your two sons with you, Ahimaaz thy son, and Jonathan
the son of Abiathar.
 <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C15V28">&nbsp;</a>See, I will tarry in the plain of the wilderness, until there come word from you to certify me.
 <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C15V29">&nbsp;</a>Zadok therefore and Abiathar carried the ark of God again to Jerusalem: and they tarried there.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 30</span><a name="C15V30">&nbsp;</a>And David went up by the ascent of
<span class="add">mount</span> Olivet, and wept as he went up, and had his head covered, and he went barefoot: and all the people that
<span class="add">was</span> with him covered every man his head, and they went up, weeping as they went up.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 31</span><a name="C15V31">&nbsp;</a>And
<span class="add">one</span> told David, saying, Ahithophel
<span class="add">is</span> among the conspirators with Absalom. And David said, O LORD, I pray thee, turn the counsel of Ahithophel
into foolishness.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 32</span><a name="C15V32">&nbsp;</a>And it came to pass, that
<span class="add">when</span> David was come to the top
<span class="add">of the mount,</span> where he worshipped God, behold, Hushai the Archite came to meet him with his coat rent, and earth upon
his head:
 <span class="verse"> 33</span><a name="C15V33">&nbsp;</a>Unto whom David said, If thou passest on with me, then thou shalt be a burden unto me:
 <span class="verse"> 34</span><a name="C15V34">&nbsp;</a>But if thou return to the city, and say unto Absalom, I will be thy servant, O king;
<span class="add">as</span> I
<span class="add">have been</span> thy father’s servant hitherto, so
<span class="add">will</span> I now also
<span class="add">be</span> thy servant: then mayest thou for me defeat the counsel of Ahithophel.
 <span class="verse"> 35</span><a name="C15V35">&nbsp;</a>And
<span class="add">hast thou</span> not there with thee Zadok and Abiathar the priests? therefore it shall be,
<span class="add">that</span> what thing soever thou shalt hear out of the king’s house, thou shalt tell
<span class="add">it</span> to Zadok and Abiathar the priests.
 <span class="verse"> 36</span><a name="C15V36">&nbsp;</a>Behold,
<span class="add">they have</span> there with them their two sons, Ahimaaz Zadok’s
<span class="add">son,</span> and Jonathan Abiathar’s
<span class="add">son;</span> and by them ye shall send unto me every thing that ye can hear.
 <span class="verse"> 37</span><a name="C15V37">&nbsp;</a>So Hushai David’s friend came into the city, and Absalom came into Jerusalem.
