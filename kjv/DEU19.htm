 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C19V1">&nbsp;</a>When the LORD thy God hath cut off the nations, whose land the LORD thy God giveth thee, and thou succeedest
them, and dwellest in their cities, and in their houses;
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C19V2">&nbsp;</a>Thou shalt separate three cities for thee in the midst of thy land, which the LORD thy God giveth thee
to possess it.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C19V3">&nbsp;</a>Thou shalt prepare thee a way, and divide the coasts of thy land, which the LORD thy God giveth thee
to inherit, into three parts, that every slayer may flee thither.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C19V4">&nbsp;</a>And this
<span class="add">is</span> the case of the slayer, which shall flee thither, that he may live: Whoso killeth his neighbour ignorantly,
whom he hated not in time past;
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C19V5">&nbsp;</a>As when a man goeth into the wood with his neighbour to hew wood, and his hand fetcheth a stroke with
the axe to cut down the tree, and the head slippeth from the helve, and lighteth upon his neighbour,
that he die; he shall flee unto one of those cities, and live:
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C19V6">&nbsp;</a>Lest the avenger of the blood pursue the slayer, while his heart is hot, and overtake him, because the
way is long, and slay him; whereas he
<span class="add">was</span> not worthy of death, inasmuch as he hated him not in time past.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C19V7">&nbsp;</a>Wherefore I command thee, saying, Thou shalt separate three cities for thee.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C19V8">&nbsp;</a>And if the LORD thy God enlarge thy coast, as he hath sworn unto thy fathers, and give thee all the land
which he promised to give unto thy fathers;
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C19V9">&nbsp;</a>If thou shalt keep all these commandments to do them, which I command thee this day, to love the LORD
thy God, and to walk ever in his ways; then shalt thou add three cities more for thee, beside these three:
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C19V10">&nbsp;</a>That innocent blood be not shed in thy land, which the LORD thy God giveth thee
<span class="add">for</span> an inheritance, and
<span class="add">so</span> blood be upon thee.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C19V11">&nbsp;</a>But if any man hate his neighbour, and lie in wait for him, and rise up against him, and smite him mortally
that he die, and fleeth into one of these cities:
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C19V12">&nbsp;</a>Then the elders of his city shall send and fetch him thence, and deliver him into the hand of the avenger
of blood, that he may die.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C19V13">&nbsp;</a>Thine eye shall not pity him, but thou shalt put away
<span class="add">the guilt of</span> innocent blood from Israel, that it may go well with thee.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C19V14">&nbsp;</a>Thou shalt not remove thy neighbour’s landmark, which they of old time have set in thine inheritance,
which thou shalt inherit in the land that the LORD thy God giveth thee to possess it.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C19V15">&nbsp;</a>One witness shall not rise up against a man for any iniquity, or for any sin, in any sin that he sinneth:
at the mouth of two witnesses, or at the mouth of three witnesses, shall the matter be established.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C19V16">&nbsp;</a>If a false witness rise up against any man to testify against him
<span class="add">that which is</span> wrong;
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C19V17">&nbsp;</a>Then both the men, between whom the controversy
<span class="add">is,</span> shall stand before the LORD, before the priests and the judges, which shall be in those days;
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C19V18">&nbsp;</a>And the judges shall make diligent inquisition: and, behold,
<span class="add">if</span> the witness
<span class="add">be</span> a false witness,
<span class="add">and</span> hath testified falsely against his brother;
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C19V19">&nbsp;</a>Then shall ye do unto him, as he had thought to have done unto his brother: so shalt thou put the evil
away from among you.
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C19V20">&nbsp;</a>And those which remain shall hear, and fear, and shall henceforth commit no more any such evil among
you.
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C19V21">&nbsp;</a>And thine eye shall not pity;
<span class="add">but</span> life
<span class="add">shall go</span> for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot.
