 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C5V1">&nbsp;</a>I am come into my garden, my sister,
<span class="add">my</span> spouse: I have gathered my myrrh with my spice; I have eaten my honeycomb with my honey; I have drunk
my wine with my milk: eat, O friends; drink, yea, drink abundantly, O beloved.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C5V2">&nbsp;</a>I sleep, but my heart waketh:
<span class="add">it is</span> the voice of my beloved that knocketh,
<span class="add">saying,</span> Open to me, my sister, my love, my dove, my undefiled: for my head is filled with dew,
<span class="add">and</span> my locks with the drops of the night.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C5V3">&nbsp;</a>I have put off my coat; how shall I put it on? I have washed my feet; how shall I defile them?
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C5V4">&nbsp;</a>My beloved put in his hand by the hole
<span class="add">of the door,</span> and my bowels were moved for him.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C5V5">&nbsp;</a>I rose up to open to my beloved; and my hands dropped
<span class="add">with</span> myrrh, and my fingers
<span class="add">with</span> sweet smelling myrrh, upon the handles of the lock.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C5V6">&nbsp;</a>I opened to my beloved; but my beloved had withdrawn himself,
<span class="add">and</span> was gone: my soul failed when he spake: I sought him, but I could not find him; I called him, but he
gave me no answer.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C5V7">&nbsp;</a>The watchmen that went about the city found me, they smote me, they wounded me; the keepers of the walls
took away my veil from me.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C5V8">&nbsp;</a>I charge you, O daughters of Jerusalem, if ye find my beloved, that ye tell him, that I
<span class="add">am</span> sick of love.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C5V9">&nbsp;</a>What
<span class="add">is</span> thy beloved more than
<span class="add">another</span> beloved, O thou fairest among women? what
<span class="add">is</span> thy beloved more than
<span class="add">another</span> beloved, that thou dost so charge us?
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C5V10">&nbsp;</a>My beloved
<span class="add">is</span> white and ruddy, the chiefest among ten thousand.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C5V11">&nbsp;</a>His head
<span class="add">is as</span> the most fine gold, his locks
<span class="add">are</span> bushy,
<span class="add">and</span> black as a raven.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C5V12">&nbsp;</a>His eyes
<span class="add">are</span> as
<span class="add">the eyes</span> of doves by the rivers of waters, washed with milk,
<span class="add">and</span> fitly set.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C5V13">&nbsp;</a>His cheeks
<span class="add">are</span> as a bed of spices,
<span class="add">as</span> sweet flowers: his lips
<span class="add">like</span> lilies, dropping sweet smelling myrrh.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C5V14">&nbsp;</a>His hands
<span class="add">are as</span> gold rings set with the beryl: his belly
<span class="add">is as</span> bright ivory overlaid
<span class="add">with</span> sapphires.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C5V15">&nbsp;</a>His legs
<span class="add">are as</span> pillars of marble, set upon sockets of fine gold: his countenance
<span class="add">is</span> as Lebanon, excellent as the cedars.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C5V16">&nbsp;</a>His mouth
<span class="add">is</span> most sweet: yea, he
<span class="add">is</span> altogether lovely. This
<span class="add">is</span> my beloved, and this
<span class="add">is</span> my friend, O daughters of Jerusalem.
