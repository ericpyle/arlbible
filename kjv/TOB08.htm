 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C8V1">&nbsp;</a>And when they had supped, they brought Tobias in unto her.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C8V2">&nbsp;</a>And as he went, he remembered the words of Raphael, and took the ashes of the perfumes, and put the heart
and the liver of the fish thereupon, and made a smoke therewith.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C8V3">&nbsp;</a>The which smell when the evil spirit had smelled, he fled into the utmost parts of Egypt, and the angel
bound him.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C8V4">&nbsp;</a>And after that they were both shut in together, Tobias rose out of the bed, and said, Sister, arise,
and let us pray that God would have pity on us.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C8V5">&nbsp;</a>Then began Tobias to say, Blessed art thou, O God of our fathers, and blessed is thy holy and glorious
name for ever; let the heavens bless thee, and all thy creatures.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C8V6">&nbsp;</a>Thou madest Adam, and gavest him Eve his wife for an helper and stay: of them came mankind: thou hast
said, It is not good that man should be alone; let us make unto him an aid like unto himself.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C8V7">&nbsp;</a>And now, O Lord, I take not this my sister for lust but uprightly: therefore mercifully ordain that we
may become aged together.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C8V8">&nbsp;</a>And she said with him, Amen.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C8V9">&nbsp;</a>So they slept both that night. And Raguel arose, and went and made a grave,
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C8V10">&nbsp;</a>Saying, I fear lest he also be dead.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C8V11">&nbsp;</a>But when Raguel was come into his house,
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C8V12">&nbsp;</a>He said unto his wife Edna. Send one of the maids, and let her see whether he be alive: if he be not,
that we may bury him, and no man know it.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C8V13">&nbsp;</a>So the maid opened the door, and went in, and found them both asleep,
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C8V14">&nbsp;</a>And came forth, and told them that he was alive.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C8V15">&nbsp;</a>Then Raguel praised God, and said, O God, thou art worthy to be praised with all pure and holy praise;
therefore let thy saints praise thee with all thy creatures; and let all thine angels and thine elect
praise thee for ever.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C8V16">&nbsp;</a>Thou art to be praised, for thou hast made me joyful; and that is not come to me which I suspected; but
thou hast dealt with us according to thy great mercy.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C8V17">&nbsp;</a>Thou art to be praised because thou hast had mercy of two that were the only begotten children of their
fathers: grant them mercy, O Lord, and finish their life in health with joy and mercy.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C8V18">&nbsp;</a>Then Raguel bade his servants to fill the grave.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C8V19">&nbsp;</a>And he kept the wedding feast fourteen days.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C8V20">&nbsp;</a>For before the days of the marriage were finished, Raguel had said unto him by an oath, that he should
not depart till the fourteen days of the marriage were expired;
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C8V21">&nbsp;</a>And then he should take the half of his goods, and go in safety to his father; and should have the rest
when I and my wife be dead.
