When the LORD shall stretch out his hand, both he that helpeth shall fall, and he that is holpen shall fall down, and they all shall fail together.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>For thus hath the LORD spoken unto me, Like as the lion and the young lion roaring on his prey, when a multitude of shepherds is called forth against him, <span class='add'>he</span> will not be afraid of their voice, nor abase himself for the noise of them: so shall the LORD of hosts come down to fight for mount Zion, and for the hill thereof.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>As birds flying, so will the LORD of hosts defend Jerusalem; defending also he will deliver <span class='add'>it; and</span> passing over he will preserve <span class='add'>it</span>. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>Turn ye unto <span class='add'>him from</span> whom the children of Israel have deeply revolted.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>For in that day every man shall cast away his idols of silver, and his idols of gold, which your own hands have made unto you <span class='add'>for</span> a sin. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>Then shall the Assyrian fall with the sword, not of a mighty man; and the sword, not of a mean man, shall devour him: but he shall flee from the sword, and his young men shall be discomfited.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>And he shall pass over to his strong hold for fear, and his princes shall be afraid of the ensign, saith the LORD, whose fire <span class='add'>is</span> in Zion, and his furnace in Jerusalem. </div><ul class='tnav'>
