 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C8V1">&nbsp;</a>Again the word of the LORD of hosts came
<span class="add">to me,</span> saying,
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C8V2">&nbsp;</a>Thus saith the LORD of hosts; I was jealous for Zion with great jealousy, and I was jealous for her with
great fury.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C8V3">&nbsp;</a>Thus saith the LORD; I am returned unto Zion, and will dwell in the midst of Jerusalem: and Jerusalem
shall be called a city of truth; and the mountain of the LORD of hosts the holy mountain.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C8V4">&nbsp;</a>Thus saith the LORD of hosts; There shall yet old men and old women dwell in the streets of Jerusalem,
and every man with his staff in his hand for very age.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C8V5">&nbsp;</a>And the streets of the city shall be full of boys and girls playing in the streets thereof.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C8V6">&nbsp;</a>Thus saith the LORD of hosts; If it be marvellous in the eyes of the remnant of this people in these
days, should it also be marvellous in mine eyes? saith the LORD of hosts.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C8V7">&nbsp;</a>Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Behold, I will save my people from the east country, and from the west
country;
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C8V8">&nbsp;</a>And I will bring them, and they shall dwell in the midst of Jerusalem: and they shall be my people, and
I will be their God, in truth and in righteousness.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C8V9">&nbsp;</a>Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Let your hands be strong, ye that hear in these days these words by the
mouth of the prophets, which
<span class="add">were
</span> in the day
<span class="add">that</span> the foundation of the house of the LORD of hosts was laid, that the temple might be built.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C8V10">&nbsp;</a>For before these days there was no hire for man, nor any hire for beast; neither
<span class="add">was there any</span> peace to him that went out or came in because of the affliction: for I set all men every one against
his neighbour.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C8V11">&nbsp;</a>But now I
<span class="add">will</span> not
<span class="add">be</span> unto the residue of this people as in the former days, saith the LORD of hosts.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C8V12">&nbsp;</a>For the seed
<span class="add">shall be</span> prosperous; the vine shall give her fruit, and the ground shall give her increase, and the heavens shall
give their dew; and I will cause the remnant of this people to possess all these
<span class="add">things.
</span> <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C8V13">&nbsp;</a>And it shall come to pass,
<span class="add">that</span> as ye were a curse among the heathen, O house of Judah, and house of Israel; so will I save you, and
ye shall be a blessing: fear not,
<span class="add">but</span> let your hands be strong.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C8V14">&nbsp;</a>For thus saith the LORD of hosts; As I thought to punish you, when your fathers provoked me to wrath,
saith the LORD of hosts, and I repented not:
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C8V15">&nbsp;</a>So again have I thought in these days to do well unto Jerusalem and to the house of Judah: fear ye not.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C8V16">&nbsp;</a>These
<span class="add">are</span> the things that ye shall do; Speak ye every man the truth to his neighbour; execute the judgment of
truth and peace in your gates:
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C8V17">&nbsp;</a>And let none of you imagine evil in your hearts against his neighbour; and love no false oath: for all
these
<span class="add">are things</span> that I hate, saith the LORD.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C8V18">&nbsp;</a>And the word of the LORD of hosts came unto me, saying,
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C8V19">&nbsp;</a>Thus saith the LORD of hosts; The fast of the fourth
<span class="add">month,
</span> and the fast of the fifth, and the fast of the seventh, and the fast of the tenth, shall be to the house
of Judah joy and gladness, and cheerful feasts; therefore love the truth and peace.
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C8V20">&nbsp;</a>Thus saith the LORD of hosts;
<span class="add">It shall</span> yet
<span class="add">come to pass,
</span> that there shall come people, and the inhabitants of many cities:
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C8V21">&nbsp;</a>And the inhabitants of one
<span class="add">city</span> shall go to another, saying, Let us go speedily to pray before the LORD, and to seek the LORD of hosts:
I will go also.
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C8V22">&nbsp;</a>Yea, many people and strong nations shall come to seek the LORD of hosts in Jerusalem, and to pray before
the LORD.
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C8V23">&nbsp;</a>Thus saith the LORD of hosts; In those days
<span class="add">it shall come to pass,
</span> that ten men shall take hold out of all languages of the nations, even shall take hold of the skirt
of him that is a Jew, saying, We will go with you: for we have heard
<span class="add">that</span> God
<span class="add">is</span> with you.
