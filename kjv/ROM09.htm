<div><a name="C9V0"><hr></a>
<div class="chapterlabel"> 9</div><div class="p">
 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C9V1">&nbsp;</a>I say the truth in Christ, I lie not, my conscience also bearing me witness in the Holy Ghost,
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C9V2">&nbsp;</a>That I have great heaviness and continual sorrow in my heart.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C9V3">&nbsp;</a>For I could wish that myself were accursed from Christ for my brethren, my kinsmen according to the flesh:
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C9V4">&nbsp;</a>Who are Israelites; to whom
<span class="add">pertaineth</span> the adoption, and the glory, and the covenants, and the giving of the law, and the service
<span class="add">of God,</span> and the promises;
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C9V5">&nbsp;</a>Whose
<span class="add">are</span> the fathers, and of whom as concerning the flesh Christ
<span class="add">came,</span> who is over all, God blessed for ever. Amen.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C9V6">&nbsp;</a>Not as though the word of God hath taken none effect. For they
<span class="add">are</span> not all Israel, which are of Israel:
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C9V7">&nbsp;</a>Neither, because they are the seed of Abraham,
<span class="add">are they</span> all children: but, In Isaac shall thy seed be called.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C9V8">&nbsp;</a>That is, They which are the children of the flesh, these
<span class="add">are
</span> not the children of God: but the children of the promise are counted for the seed.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C9V9">&nbsp;</a>For this
<span class="add">is</span> the word of promise, At this time will I come, and Sarah shall have a son.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C9V10">&nbsp;</a>And not only
<span class="add">this;</span> but when Rebecca also had conceived by one,
<span class="add">even</span> by our father Isaac;
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C9V11">&nbsp;</a>(For
<span class="add">the children</span> being not yet born, neither having done any good or evil, that the purpose of God according to election
might stand, not of works, but of him that calleth;)
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C9V12">&nbsp;</a>It was said unto her, The elder shall serve the younger.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C9V13">&nbsp;</a>As it is written, Jacob have I loved, but Esau have I hated.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C9V14">&nbsp;</a>What shall we say then?
<span class="add">Is there</span> unrighteousness with God? God forbid.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C9V15">&nbsp;</a>For he saith to Moses, I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom
I will have compassion.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C9V16">&nbsp;</a>So then
<span class="add">it is</span> not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that sheweth mercy.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C9V17">&nbsp;</a>For the scripture saith unto Pharaoh, Even for this same purpose have I raised thee up, that I might
shew my power in thee, and that my name might be declared throughout all the earth.
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C9V18">&nbsp;</a>Therefore hath he mercy on whom he will
<span class="add">have mercy,</span> and whom he will he hardeneth.
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C9V19">&nbsp;</a>Thou wilt say then unto me, Why doth he yet find fault? For who hath resisted his will?
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C9V20">&nbsp;</a>Nay but, O man, who art thou that repliest against God? Shall the thing formed say to him that formed
<span class="add">it,</span> Why hast thou made me thus?
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C9V21">&nbsp;</a>Hath not the potter power over the clay, of the same lump to make one vessel unto honour, and another
unto dishonour?
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C9V22">&nbsp;</a><span class="add">What</span> if God, willing to shew
<span class="add">his</span> wrath, and to make his power known, endured with much longsuffering the vessels of wrath fitted to destruction:
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C9V23">&nbsp;</a>And that he might make known the riches of his glory on the vessels of mercy, which he had afore prepared
unto glory,
 <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C9V24">&nbsp;</a>Even us, whom he hath called, not of the Jews only, but also of the Gentiles?
 <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C9V25">&nbsp;</a>As he saith also in Osee, I will call them my people, which were not my people; and her beloved, which
was not beloved.
 <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C9V26">&nbsp;</a>And it shall come to pass,
<span class="add">that</span> in the place where it was said unto them, Ye
<span class="add">are</span> not my people; there shall they be called the children of the living God.
 <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C9V27">&nbsp;</a>Esaias also crieth concerning Israel, Though the number of the children of Israel be as the sand of the
sea, a remnant shall be saved:
 <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C9V28">&nbsp;</a>For he will finish the work, and cut
<span class="add">it</span> short in righteousness: because a short work will the Lord make upon the earth.
 <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C9V29">&nbsp;</a>And as Esaias said before, Except the Lord of Sabaoth had left us a seed, we had been as Sodoma, and
been made like unto Gomorrha.
 <span class="verse"> 30</span><a name="C9V30">&nbsp;</a>What shall we say then? That the Gentiles, which followed not after righteousness, have attained to righteousness,
even the righteousness which is of faith.
 <span class="verse"> 31</span><a name="C9V31">&nbsp;</a>But Israel, which followed after the law of righteousness, hath not attained to the law of righteousness.
 <span class="verse"> 32</span><a name="C9V32">&nbsp;</a>Wherefore? Because
<span class="add">they sought it</span> not by faith, but as it were by the works of the law. For they stumbled at that stumblingstone;
 <span class="verse"> 33</span><a name="C9V33">&nbsp;</a>As it is written, Behold, I lay in Sion a stumblingstone and rock of offence: and whosoever believeth
on him shall not be ashamed.
