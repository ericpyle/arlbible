 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C6V1">&nbsp;</a>Brethren, if a man be overtaken in a fault, ye which are spiritual, restore such an one in the spirit
of meekness; considering thyself, lest thou also be tempted.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C6V2">&nbsp;</a>Bear ye one another’s burdens, and so fulfil the law of Christ.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C6V3">&nbsp;</a>For if a man think himself to be something, when he is nothing, he deceiveth himself.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C6V4">&nbsp;</a>But let every man prove his own work, and then shall he have rejoicing in himself alone, and not in another.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C6V5">&nbsp;</a>For every man shall bear his own burden.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C6V6">&nbsp;</a>Let him that is taught in the word communicate unto him that teacheth in all good things.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C6V7">&nbsp;</a>Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C6V8">&nbsp;</a>For he that soweth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption; but he that soweth to the Spirit
shall of the Spirit reap life everlasting.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C6V9">&nbsp;</a>And let us not be weary in well doing: for in due season we shall reap, if we faint not.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C6V10">&nbsp;</a>As we have therefore opportunity, let us do good unto all
<span class="add">men,
</span> especially unto them who are of the household of faith.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C6V11">&nbsp;</a>Ye see how large a letter I have written unto you with mine own hand.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C6V12">&nbsp;</a>As many as desire to make a fair shew in the flesh, they constrain you to be circumcised; only lest they
should suffer persecution for the cross of Christ.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C6V13">&nbsp;</a>For neither they themselves who are circumcised keep the law; but desire to have you circumcised, that
they may glory in your flesh.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C6V14">&nbsp;</a>But God forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world is
crucified unto me, and I unto the world.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C6V15">&nbsp;</a>For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision, but a new creature.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C6V16">&nbsp;</a>And as many as walk according to this rule, peace
<span class="add">be</span> on them, and mercy, and upon the Israel of God.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C6V17">&nbsp;</a>From henceforth let no man trouble me: for I bear in my body the marks of the Lord Jesus.
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C6V18">&nbsp;</a>Brethren, the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ
<span class="add">be</span> with your spirit. Amen.
