 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C18V1">&nbsp;</a>Now after this it came to pass, that David smote the Philistines, and subdued them, and took Gath and
her towns out of the hand of the Philistines.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C18V2">&nbsp;</a>And he smote Moab; and the Moabites became David’s servants,
<span class="add">and</span> brought gifts.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C18V3">&nbsp;</a>And David smote Hadarezer king of Zobah unto Hamath, as he went to stablish his dominion by the river
Euphrates.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C18V4">&nbsp;</a>And David took from him a thousand chariots, and seven thousand horsemen, and twenty thousand footmen:
David also houghed all the chariot
<span class="add">horses,</span> but reserved of them an hundred chariots.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C18V5">&nbsp;</a>And when the Syrians of Damascus came to help Hadarezer king of Zobah, David slew of the Syrians two
and twenty thousand men.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C18V6">&nbsp;</a>Then David put
<span class="add">garrisons</span> in Syria-damascus; and the Syrians became David’s servants,
<span class="add">and</span> brought gifts. Thus the LORD preserved David whithersoever he went.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C18V7">&nbsp;</a>And David took the shields of gold that were on the servants of Hadarezer, and brought them to Jerusalem.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C18V8">&nbsp;</a>Likewise from Tibhath, and from Chun, cities of Hadarezer, brought David very much brass, wherewith Solomon
made the brasen sea, and the pillars, and the vessels of brass.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C18V9">&nbsp;</a>Now when Tou king of Hamath heard how David had smitten all the host of Hadarezer king of Zobah;
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C18V10">&nbsp;</a>He sent Hadoram his son to king David, to enquire of his welfare, and to congratulate him, because he
had fought against Hadarezer, and smitten him; (for Hadarezer had war with Tou;) and
<span class="add">with him</span> all manner of vessels of gold and silver and brass.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C18V11">&nbsp;</a>Them also king David dedicated unto the LORD, with the silver and the gold that he brought from all
<span class="add">these</span> nations; from Edom, and from Moab, and from the children of Ammon, and from the Philistines, and from
Amalek.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C18V12">&nbsp;</a>Moreover Abishai the son of Zeruiah slew of the Edomites in the valley of salt eighteen thousand.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C18V13">&nbsp;</a>And he put garrisons in Edom; and all the Edomites became David’s servants. Thus the LORD preserved David
whithersoever he went.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C18V14">&nbsp;</a>So David reigned over all Israel, and executed judgment and justice among all his people.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C18V15">&nbsp;</a>And Joab the son Zeruiah was over the host; and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud, recorder.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C18V16">&nbsp;</a>And Zadok the son of Ahitub, and Abimelech the son of Abiathar,
<span class="add">were</span> the priests; and Shavsha was scribe;
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C18V17">&nbsp;</a>And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada
<span class="add">was</span> over the Cherethites and the Pelethites; and the sons of David
<span class="add">were</span> chief about the king.
