 <span class="verse" id="V1">1&nbsp;</span>Now Korah, the son of Izhar, the son of Kohath, the son of Levi, and Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, and On, the son of Peleth, sons of Reuben, took <span class='add'>men:</span>  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span>And they rose up before Moses, with certain of the children of Israel, two hundred and fifty princes of the assembly, famous in the congregation, men of renown:  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>And they gathered themselves together against Moses and against Aaron, and said unto them, <span class='add'>Ye take</span> too much upon you, seeing all the congregation <span class='add'>are</span> holy, every one of them, and the LORD <span class='add'>is</span> among them: wherefore then lift ye up yourselves above the congregation of the LORD?  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>And when Moses heard <span class='add'>it</span>, he fell upon his face:  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>And he spake unto Korah and unto all his company, saying, Even to morrow the LORD will shew who <span class='add'>are</span> his, and <span class='add'>who is</span> holy; and will cause <span class='add'>him</span> to come near unto him: even <span class='add'>him</span> whom he hath chosen will he cause to come near unto him.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>This do; Take you censers, Korah, and all his company;  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>And put fire therein, and put incense in them before the LORD to morrow: and it shall be <span class='add'>that</span> the man whom the LORD doth choose, he <span class='add'>shall be</span> holy: <span class='add'>ye take</span> too much upon you, ye sons of Levi.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>And Moses said unto Korah, Hear, I pray you, ye sons of Levi:  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span> <span class='add'>Seemeth it but</span> a small thing unto you, that the God of Israel hath separated you from the congregation of Israel, to bring you near to himself to do the service of the tabernacle of the LORD, and to stand before the congregation to minister unto them?  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>And he hath brought thee near <span class='add'>to him</span>, and all thy brethren the sons of Levi with thee: and seek ye the priesthood also?  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>For which cause <span class='add'>both</span> thou and all thy company <span class='add'>are</span> gathered together against the LORD: and what <span class='add'>is</span> Aaron, that ye murmur against him? </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>And Moses sent to call Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab: which said, We will not come up:  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span> <span class='add'>Is it</span> a small thing that thou hast brought us up out of a land that floweth with milk and honey, to kill us in the wilderness, except thou make thyself altogether a prince over us?  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>Moreover thou hast not brought us into a land that floweth with milk and honey, or given us inheritance of fields and vineyards: wilt thou put out the eyes of these men? we will not come up.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>And Moses was very wroth, and said unto the LORD, Respect not thou their offering: I have not taken one ass from them, neither have I hurt one of them.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>And Moses said unto Korah, Be thou and all thy company before the LORD, thou, and they, and Aaron, to morrow:  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>And take every man his censer, and put incense in them, and bring ye before the LORD every man his censer, two hundred and fifty censers; thou also, and Aaron, each <span class='add'>of you</span> his censer.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>And they took every man his censer, and put fire in them, and laid incense thereon, and stood in the door of the tabernacle of the congregation with Moses and Aaron.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>And Korah gathered all the congregation against them unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation: and the glory of the LORD appeared unto all the congregation.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>Separate yourselves from among this congregation, that I may consume them in a moment.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>And they fell upon their faces, and said, O God, the God of the spirits of all flesh, shall one man sin, and wilt thou be wroth with all the congregation?
