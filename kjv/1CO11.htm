<div class="chapterlabel"> 11</div><div class="p">
 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C11V1">&nbsp;</a>Be ye followers of me, even as I also
<span class="add">am</span> of Christ.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C11V2">&nbsp;</a>Now I praise you, brethren, that ye remember me in all things, and keep the ordinances, as I delivered
<span class="add">them</span> to you.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C11V3">&nbsp;</a>But I would have you know, that the head of every man is Christ; and the head of the woman
<span class="add">is</span> the man; and the head of Christ
<span class="add">is</span> God.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C11V4">&nbsp;</a>Every man praying or prophesying, having
<span class="add">his</span> head covered, dishonoureth his head.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C11V5">&nbsp;</a>But every woman that prayeth or prophesieth with
<span class="add">her</span> head uncovered dishonoureth her head: for that is even all one as if she were shaven.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C11V6">&nbsp;</a>For if the woman be not covered, let her also be shorn: but if it be a shame for a woman to be shorn
or shaven, let her be covered.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C11V7">&nbsp;</a>For a man indeed ought not to cover
<span class="add">his</span> head, forasmuch as he is the image and glory of God: but the woman is the glory of the man.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C11V8">&nbsp;</a>For the man is not of the woman; but the woman of the man.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C11V9">&nbsp;</a>Neither was the man created for the woman; but the woman for the man.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C11V10">&nbsp;</a>For this cause ought the woman to have power on
<span class="add">her</span> head because of the angels.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C11V11">&nbsp;</a>Nevertheless neither is the man without the woman, neither the woman without the man, in the Lord.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C11V12">&nbsp;</a>For as the woman
<span class="add">is</span> of the man, even so
<span class="add">is</span> the man also by the woman; but all things of God.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C11V13">&nbsp;</a>Judge in yourselves: is it comely that a woman pray unto God uncovered?
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C11V14">&nbsp;</a>Doth not even nature itself teach you, that, if a man have long hair, it is a shame unto him?
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C11V15">&nbsp;</a>But if a woman have long hair, it is a glory to her: for
<span class="add">her</span> hair is given her for a covering.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C11V16">&nbsp;</a>But if any man seem to be contentious, we have no such custom, neither the churches of God.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C11V17">&nbsp;</a>Now in this that I declare
<span class="add">unto you</span> I praise
<span class="add">you</span> not, that ye come together not for the better, but for the worse.
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C11V18">&nbsp;</a>For first of all, when ye come together in the church, I hear that there be divisions among you; and
I partly believe it.
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C11V19">&nbsp;</a>For there must be also heresies among you, that they which are approved may be made manifest among you.
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C11V20">&nbsp;</a>When ye come together therefore into one place,
<span class="add">this</span> is not to eat the Lord’s supper.
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C11V21">&nbsp;</a>For in eating every one taketh before
<span class="add">other</span> his own supper: and one is hungry, and another is drunken.
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C11V22">&nbsp;</a>What? have ye not houses to eat and to drink in? or despise ye the church of God, and shame them that
have not? What shall I say to you? shall I praise you in this? I praise
<span class="add">you</span> not.
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C11V23">&nbsp;</a>For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, That the Lord Jesus the
<span class="add">same</span> night in which he was betrayed took bread:
 <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C11V24">&nbsp;</a>And when he had given thanks, he brake
<span class="add">it,</span> and said,
<span class="wj">Take, eat: this is my body, which is broken for you: this do in remembrance of me.
</span> <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C11V25">&nbsp;</a>After the same manner also
<span class="add">he took</span> the cup, when he had supped, saying,
<span class="wj">This cup is the new testament in my blood: this do ye, as oft as ye drink
it, in remembrance of me.
</span> <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C11V26">&nbsp;</a>For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink
<span class="add">this</span> cup, ye do shew the Lord’s death till he come.
 <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C11V27">&nbsp;</a>Wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread, and drink this cup of the Lord, unworthily, shall be guilty
of the body and blood of the Lord.
 <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C11V28">&nbsp;</a>But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of
<span class="add">that</span> bread, and drink of
<span class="add">that</span> cup.
 <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C11V29">&nbsp;</a>For he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh damnation to himself, not discerning
the Lord’s body.
 <span class="verse"> 30</span><a name="C11V30">&nbsp;</a>For this cause many
<span class="add">are</span> weak and sickly among you, and many sleep.
 <span class="verse"> 31</span><a name="C11V31">&nbsp;</a>For if we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged.
 <span class="verse"> 32</span><a name="C11V32">&nbsp;</a>But when we are judged, we are chastened of the Lord, that we should not be condemned with the world.
 <span class="verse"> 33</span><a name="C11V33">&nbsp;</a>Wherefore, my brethren, when ye come together to eat, tarry one for another.
 <span class="verse"> 34</span><a name="C11V34">&nbsp;</a>And if any man hunger, let him eat at home; that ye come not together unto condemnation. And the rest
will I set in order when I come.
