 <span class="verse" id="V1">1&nbsp;</span>I made a covenant with mine eyes; why then should I think upon a maid?  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span>For what portion of God <span class='add'>is there</span> from above? and <span class='add'>what</span> inheritance of the Almighty from on high?  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span> <span class='add'>Is</span> not destruction to the wicked? and a strange <span class='add'>punishment</span> to the workers of iniquity?  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>Doth not he see my ways, and count all my steps?  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>If I have walked with vanity, or if my foot hath hasted to deceit;  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>Let me be weighed in an even balance, that God may know mine integrity.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>If my step hath turned out of the way, and mine heart walked after mine eyes, and if any blot hath cleaved to mine hands;  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span> <span class='add'>Then</span> let me sow, and let another eat; yea, let my offspring be rooted out.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>If mine heart have been deceived by a woman, or <span class='add'>if</span> I have laid wait at my neighbour’s door;  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span> <span class='add'>Then</span> let my wife grind unto another, and let others bow down upon her.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>For this <span class='add'>is</span> an heinous crime; yea, it <span class='add'>is</span> an iniquity <span class='add'>to be punished by</span> the judges.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>For it <span class='add'>is</span> a fire <span class='add'>that</span> consumeth to destruction, and would root out all mine increase.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>If I did despise the cause of my manservant or of my maidservant, when they contended with me;  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>What then shall I do when God riseth up? and when he visiteth, what shall I answer him?  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>Did not he that made me in the womb make him? and did not one fashion us in the womb?  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>If I have withheld the poor from <span class='add'>their</span> desire, or have caused the eyes of the widow to fail;  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>Or have eaten my morsel myself alone, and the fatherless hath not eaten thereof;  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>(For from my youth he was brought up with me, as <span class='add'>with</span> a father, and I have guided her from my mother’s womb;)  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>If I have seen any perish for want of clothing, or any poor without covering;  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>If his loins have not blessed me, and <span class='add'>if</span> he were <span class='add'>not</span> warmed with the fleece of my sheep;  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>If I have lifted up my hand against the fatherless, when I saw my help in the gate:  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span> <span class='add'>Then</span> let mine arm fall from my shoulder blade, and mine arm be broken from the bone.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>For destruction <span class='add'>from</span> God <span class='add'>was</span> a terror to me, and by reason of his highness I could not endure.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>If I have made gold my hope, or have said to the fine gold, <span class='add'>Thou art</span> my confidence;  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>If I rejoiced because my wealth <span class='add'>was</span> great, and because mine hand had gotten much;  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>If I beheld the sun when it shined, or the moon walking <span class='add'>in</span> brightness;  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>And my heart hath been secretly enticed, or my mouth hath kissed my hand:  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&nbsp;</span>This also <span class='add'>were</span> an iniquity <span class='add'>to be punished by</span> the judge: for I should have denied the God <span class='add'>that is</span> above.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&nbsp;</span>If I rejoiced at the destruction of him that hated me, or lifted up myself when evil found him:  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&nbsp;</span>Neither have I suffered my mouth to sin by wishing a curse to his soul.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&nbsp;</span>If the men of my tabernacle said not, Oh that we had of his flesh! we cannot be satisfied.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&nbsp;</span>The stranger did not lodge in the street: <span class='add'>but</span> I opened my doors to the traveller.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&nbsp;</span>If I covered my transgressions as Adam, by hiding mine iniquity in my bosom:  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&nbsp;</span>Did I fear a great multitude, or did the contempt of families terrify me, that I kept silence, <span class='add'>and</span> went not out of the door?  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&nbsp;</span>Oh that one would hear me! behold, my desire <span class='add'>is, that</span> the Almighty would answer me, and <span class='add'>that</span> mine adversary had written a book.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&nbsp;</span>Surely I would take it upon my shoulder, <span class='add'>and</span> bind it <span class='add'>as</span> a crown to me.  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&nbsp;</span>I would declare unto him the number of my steps; as a prince would I go near unto him.  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&nbsp;</span>If my land cry against me, or that the furrows likewise thereof complain;  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&nbsp;</span>If I have eaten the fruits thereof without money, or have caused the owners thereof to lose their life:  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&nbsp;</span>Let thistles grow instead of wheat, and cockle instead of barley.
