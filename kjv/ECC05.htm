 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C5V1">&nbsp;</a>Keep thy foot when thou goest to the house of God, and be more ready to hear, than to give the sacrifice
of fools: for they consider not that they do evil.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C5V2">&nbsp;</a>Be not rash with thy mouth, and let not thine heart be hasty to utter
<span class="add">any</span> thing before God: for God
<span class="add">is</span> in heaven, and thou upon earth: therefore let thy words be few.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C5V3">&nbsp;</a>For a dream cometh through the multitude of business; and a fool’s voice
<span class="add">is known</span> by multitude of words.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C5V4">&nbsp;</a>When thou vowest a vow unto God, defer not to pay it; for
<span class="add">he hath</span> no pleasure in fools: pay that which thou hast vowed.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C5V5">&nbsp;</a>Better
<span class="add">is it</span> that thou shouldest not vow, than that thou shouldest vow and not pay.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C5V6">&nbsp;</a>Suffer not thy mouth to cause thy flesh to sin; neither say thou before the angel, that it
<span class="add">was</span> an error: wherefore should God be angry at thy voice, and destroy the work of thine hands?
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C5V7">&nbsp;</a>For in the multitude of dreams and many words
<span class="add">there are</span> also
<span class="add">divers</span> vanities: but fear thou God.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C5V8">&nbsp;</a>If thou seest the oppression of the poor, and violent perverting of judgment and justice in a province,
marvel not at the matter: for
<span class="add">he that is</span> higher than the highest regardeth; and
<span class="add">there be</span> higher than they.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C5V9">&nbsp;</a>Moreover the profit of the earth is for all: the king
<span class="add">himself</span> is served by the field.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C5V10">&nbsp;</a>He that loveth silver shall not be satisfied with silver; nor he that loveth abundance with increase:
this
<span class="add">is</span> also vanity.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C5V11">&nbsp;</a>When goods increase, they are increased that eat them: and what good
<span class="add">is there</span> to the owners thereof, saving the beholding
<span class="add">of them</span> with their eyes?
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C5V12">&nbsp;</a>The sleep of a labouring man
<span class="add">is</span> sweet, whether he eat little or much: but the abundance of the rich will not suffer him to sleep.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C5V13">&nbsp;</a>There is a sore evil
<span class="add">which</span> I have seen under the sun,
<span class="add">namely,</span> riches kept for the owners thereof to their hurt.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C5V14">&nbsp;</a>But those riches perish by evil travail: and he begetteth a son, and
<span class="add">there is</span> nothing in his hand.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C5V15">&nbsp;</a>As he came forth of his mother’s womb, naked shall he return to go as he came, and shall take nothing
of his labour, which he may carry away in his hand.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C5V16">&nbsp;</a>And this also
<span class="add">is</span> a sore evil,
<span class="add">that</span> in all points as he came, so shall he go: and what profit hath he that hath laboured for the wind?
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C5V17">&nbsp;</a>All his days also he eateth in darkness, and
<span class="add">he hath</span> much sorrow and wrath with his sickness.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C5V18">&nbsp;</a>Behold
<span class="add">that</span> which I have seen:
<span class="add">it is</span> good and comely
<span class="add">for one</span> to eat and to drink, and to enjoy the good of all his labour that he taketh under the sun all the days
of his life, which God giveth him: for it
<span class="add">is</span> his portion.
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C5V19">&nbsp;</a>Every man also to whom God hath given riches and wealth, and hath given him power to eat thereof, and
to take his portion, and to rejoice in his labour; this
<span class="add">is</span> the gift of God.
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C5V20">&nbsp;</a>For he shall not much remember the days of his life; because God answereth
<span class="add">him</span> in the joy of his heart.
