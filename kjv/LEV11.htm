<span class="add">it be,</span> wherein
<span class="add">any</span> work is done, it must be put into water, and it shall be unclean until the even; so it shall be cleansed.

 <span class="verse"> 43</span><a name="C11V43">&nbsp;</a>Ye shall not make yourselves abominable with any creeping thing that creepeth, neither shall ye make
yourselves unclean with them, that ye should be defiled thereby.
 <span class="verse"> 44</span><a name="C11V44">&nbsp;</a>For I
<span class="add">am</span> the LORD your God: ye shall therefore sanctify yourselves, and ye shall be holy; for I
<span class="add">am</span> holy: neither shall ye defile yourselves with any manner of creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.
 <span class="verse"> 45</span><a name="C11V45">&nbsp;</a>For I
<span class="add">am</span> the LORD that bringeth you up out of the land of Egypt, to be your God: ye shall therefore be holy,
