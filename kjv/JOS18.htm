 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C18V1">&nbsp;</a>And the whole congregation of the children of Israel assembled together at Shiloh, and set up the tabernacle
of the congregation there. And the land was subdued before them.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C18V2">&nbsp;</a>And there remained among the children of Israel seven tribes, which had not yet received their inheritance.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C18V3">&nbsp;</a>And Joshua said unto the children of Israel, How long
<span class="add">are
</span> ye slack to go to possess the land, which the LORD God of your fathers hath given you?
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C18V4">&nbsp;</a>Give out from among you three men for
<span class="add">each</span> tribe: and I will send them, and they shall rise, and go through the land, and describe it according
to the inheritance of them; and they shall come
<span class="add">again
</span> to me.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C18V5">&nbsp;</a>And they shall divide it into seven parts: Judah shall abide in their coast on the south, and the house
of Joseph shall abide in their coasts on the north.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C18V6">&nbsp;</a>Ye shall therefore describe the land
<span class="add">into</span> seven parts, and bring
<span class="add">the description</span> hither to me, that I may cast lots for you here before the LORD our God.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C18V7">&nbsp;</a>But the Levites have no part among you; for the priesthood of the LORD is their inheritance: and Gad,
and Reuben, and half the tribe of Manasseh, have received their inheritance beyond Jordan on the east,
which Moses the servant of the LORD gave them.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C18V8">&nbsp;</a>And the men arose, and went away: and Joshua charged them that went to describe the land, saying, Go
and walk through the land, and describe it, and come again to me, that I may here cast lots for you before
the LORD in Shiloh.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C18V9">&nbsp;</a>And the men went and passed through the land, and described it by cities into seven parts in a book,
and came
<span class="add">again</span> to Joshua to the host at Shiloh.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C18V10">&nbsp;</a>And Joshua cast lots for them in Shiloh before the LORD: and there Joshua divided the land unto the children
of Israel according to their divisions.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C18V11">&nbsp;</a>And the lot of the tribe of the children of Benjamin came up according to their families: and the coast
of their lot came forth between the children of Judah and the children of Joseph.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C18V12">&nbsp;</a>And their border on the north side was from Jordan; and the border went up to the side of Jericho on
the north side, and went up through the mountains westward; and the goings out thereof were at the wilderness
of Beth-aven.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C18V13">&nbsp;</a>And the border went over from thence toward Luz, to the side of Luz, which is Bethel, southward; and
the border descended to Ataroth-adar, near the hill that
<span class="add">lieth</span> on the south side of the nether Beth-horon.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C18V14">&nbsp;</a>And the border was drawn
<span class="add">thence,</span> and compassed the corner of the sea southward, from the hill that
<span class="add">lieth</span> before Beth- horon southward; and the goings out thereof were at Kirjath-baal, which
<span class="add">is
</span> Kirjath- jearim, a city of the children of Judah: this
<span class="add">was
</span> the west quarter.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C18V15">&nbsp;</a>And the south quarter
<span class="add">was</span> from the end of Kirjath-jearim, and the border went out on the west, and went out to the well of waters
of Nephtoah:
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C18V16">&nbsp;</a>And the border came down to the end of the mountain that
<span class="add">lieth
</span> before the valley of the son of Hinnom,
<span class="add">and</span> which
<span class="add">is
</span> in the valley of the giants on the north, and descended to the valley of Hinnom, to the side of Jebusi
on the south, and descended to En-rogel,
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C18V17">&nbsp;</a>And was drawn from the north, and went forth to En-shemesh, and went forth toward Geliloth, which
<span class="add">is</span> over against the going up of Adummim, and descended to the stone of Bohan the son of Reuben,
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C18V18">&nbsp;</a>And passed along toward the side over against Arabah northward, and went down unto Arabah:
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C18V19">&nbsp;</a>And the border passed along to the side of Beth-hoglah northward: and the outgoings of the border were
at the north bay of the salt sea at the south end of Jordan: this
<span class="add">was</span> the south coast.
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C18V20">&nbsp;</a>And Jordan was the border of it on the east side. This
<span class="add">was
</span> the inheritance of the children of Benjamin, by the coasts thereof round about, according to their families.
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C18V21">&nbsp;</a>Now the cities of the tribe of the children of Benjamin according to their families were Jericho, and
Beth-hoglah, and the valley of Keziz,
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C18V22">&nbsp;</a>And Beth-arabah, and Zemaraim, and Bethel,
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C18V23">&nbsp;</a>And Avim, and Parah, and Ophrah,
 <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C18V24">&nbsp;</a>And Chephar-haammonai, and Ophni, and Gaba; twelve cities with their villages:
 <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C18V25">&nbsp;</a>Gibeon, and Ramah, and Beeroth,
 <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C18V26">&nbsp;</a>And Mizpeh, and Chephirah, and Mozah,
 <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C18V27">&nbsp;</a>And Rekem, and Irpeel, and Taralah,
 <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C18V28">&nbsp;</a>And Zelah, Eleph, and Jebusi, which
<span class="add">is</span> Jerusalem, Gibeath,
<span class="add">and</span> Kirjath; fourteen cities with their villages. This
<span class="add">is
</span> the inheritance of the children of Benjamin according to their families.
