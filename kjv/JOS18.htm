 <span class="verse" id="V1">1&nbsp;</span>And the whole congregation of the children of Israel assembled together at Shiloh, and set up the tabernacle of the congregation there. And the land was subdued before them.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span>And there remained among the children of Israel seven tribes, which had not yet received their inheritance.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>And Joshua said unto the children of Israel, How long <span class='add'>are</span> ye slack to go to possess the land, which the LORD God of your fathers hath given you?  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>Give out from among you three men for <span class='add'>each</span> tribe: and I will send them, and they shall rise, and go through the land, and describe it according to the inheritance of them; and they shall come <span class='add'>again</span> to me.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>And they shall divide it into seven parts: Judah shall abide in their coast on the south, and the house of Joseph shall abide in their coasts on the north.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>Ye shall therefore describe the land <span class='add'>into</span> seven parts, and bring <span class='add'>the description</span> hither to me, that I may cast lots for you here before the LORD our God.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>But the Levites have no part among you; for the priesthood of the LORD is their inheritance: and Gad, and Reuben, and half the tribe of Manasseh, have received their inheritance beyond Jordan on the east, which Moses the servant of the LORD gave them. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>And the men arose, and went away: and Joshua charged them that went to describe the land, saying, Go and walk through the land, and describe it, and come again to me, that I may here cast lots for you before the LORD in Shiloh.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>And the men went and passed through the land, and described it by cities into seven parts in a book, and came <span class='add'>again</span> to Joshua to the host at Shiloh. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>And Joshua cast lots for them in Shiloh before the LORD: and there Joshua divided the land unto the children of Israel according to their divisions. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>And the lot of the tribe of the children of Benjamin came up according to their families: and the coast of their lot came forth between the children of Judah and the children of Joseph.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>And their border on the north side was from Jordan; and the border went up to the side of Jericho on the north side, and went up through the mountains westward; and the goings out thereof were at the wilderness of Beth-aven.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>And the border went over from thence toward Luz, to the side of Luz, which is Beth-el, southward; and the border descended to Ataroth-adar, near the hill that <span class='add'>lieth</span> on the south side of the nether Beth-horon.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>And the border was drawn <span class='add'>thence</span>, and compassed the corner of the sea southward, from the hill that <span class='add'>lieth</span> before Beth-horon southward; and the goings out thereof were at Kirjath-baal, which <span class='add'>is</span> Kirjath-jearim, a city of the children of Judah: this <span class='add'>was</span> the west quarter.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>And the south quarter <span class='add'>was</span> from the end of Kirjath-jearim, and the border went out on the west, and went out to the well of waters of Nephtoah:  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>And the border came down to the end of the mountain that <span class='add'>lieth</span> before the valley of the son of Hinnom, <span class='add'>and</span> which <span class='add'>is</span> in the valley of the giants on the north, and descended to the valley of Hinnom, to the side of Jebusi on the south, and descended to En-rogel,  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>And was drawn from the north, and went forth to En-shemesh, and went forth toward Geliloth, which <span class='add'>is</span> over against the going up of Adummim, and descended to the stone of Bohan the son of Reuben,  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>And passed along toward the side over against Arabah northward, and went down unto Arabah:  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>And the border passed along to the side of Beth-hoglah northward: and the outgoings of the border were at the north bay of the salt sea at the south end of Jordan: this <span class='add'>was</span> the south coast.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>And Jordan was the border of it on the east side.
