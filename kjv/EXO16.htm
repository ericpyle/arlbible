 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C16V1">&nbsp;</a>And they took their journey from Elim, and all the congregation of the children of Israel came unto the
wilderness of Sin, which
<span class="add">is</span> between Elim and Sinai, on the fifteenth day of the second month after their departing out of the land
of Egypt.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C16V2">&nbsp;</a>And the whole congregation of the children of Israel murmured against Moses and Aaron in the wilderness:
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C16V3">&nbsp;</a>And the children of Israel said unto them, Would to God we had died by the hand of the LORD in the land
of Egypt, when we sat by the flesh pots,
<span class="add">and</span> when we did eat bread to the full; for ye have brought us forth into this wilderness, to kill this whole
assembly with hunger.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C16V4">&nbsp;</a>Then said the LORD unto Moses, Behold, I will rain bread from heaven for you; and the people shall go
out and gather a certain rate every day, that I may prove them, whether they will walk in my law, or
no.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C16V5">&nbsp;</a>And it shall come to pass, that on the sixth day they shall prepare
<span class="add">that</span> which they bring in; and it shall be twice as much as they gather daily.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C16V6">&nbsp;</a>And Moses and Aaron said unto all the children of Israel, At even, then ye shall know that the LORD hath
brought you out from the land of Egypt:
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C16V7">&nbsp;</a>And in the morning, then ye shall see the glory of the LORD; for that he heareth your murmurings against
the LORD: and what
<span class="add">are</span> we, that ye murmur against us?
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C16V8">&nbsp;</a>And Moses said,
<span class="add">This shall be,</span> when the LORD shall give you in the evening flesh to eat, and in the morning bread to the full; for
that the LORD heareth your murmurings which ye murmur against him: and what
<span class="add">are
</span> we? your murmurings
<span class="add">are</span> not against us, but against the LORD.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C16V9">&nbsp;</a>And Moses spake unto Aaron, Say unto all the congregation of the children of Israel, Come near before
the LORD: for he hath heard your murmurings.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C16V10">&nbsp;</a>And it came to pass, as Aaron spake unto the whole congregation of the children of Israel, that they
looked toward the wilderness, and, behold, the glory of the LORD appeared in the cloud.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C16V11">&nbsp;</a>And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C16V12">&nbsp;</a>I have heard the murmurings of the children of Israel: speak unto them, saying, At even ye shall eat
flesh, and in the morning ye shall be filled with bread; and ye shall know that I
<span class="add">am</span> the LORD your God.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C16V13">&nbsp;</a>And it came to pass, that at even the quails came up, and covered the camp: and in the morning the dew
lay round about the host.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C16V14">&nbsp;</a>And when the dew that lay was gone up, behold, upon the face of the wilderness
<span class="add">there lay</span> a small round thing,
<span class="add">as</span> small as the hoar frost on the ground.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C16V15">&nbsp;</a>And when the children of Israel saw
<span class="add">it,</span> they said one to another, It
<span class="add">is</span> manna: for they wist not what it
<span class="add">was.
</span> And Moses said unto them, This
<span class="add">is</span> the bread which the LORD hath given you to eat.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C16V16">&nbsp;</a>This
<span class="add">is</span> the thing which the LORD hath commanded, Gather of it every man
<span class="add">according to</span> his eating, an omer for every man, according to the number of your persons; take ye every man for
<span class="add">them</span> which
<span class="add">are</span> in his tents.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C16V17">&nbsp;</a>And the children of Israel did so, and gathered, some more, some less.
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C16V18">&nbsp;</a>And when they did mete
<span class="add">it</span> with an omer, he that gathered much had nothing over, and he that gathered little had no lack; they
gathered every man according to his eating.
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C16V19">&nbsp;</a>And Moses said, Let no man leave of it till the morning.
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C16V20">&nbsp;</a>Notwithstanding they hearkened not unto Moses; but some of them left of it until the morning, and it
bred worms, and stank: and Moses was wroth with them.
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C16V21">&nbsp;</a>And they gathered it every morning, every man according to his eating: and when the sun waxed hot, it
melted.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C16V22">&nbsp;</a>And it came to pass,
<span class="add">that</span> on the sixth day they gathered twice as much bread, two omers for one
<span class="add">man:</span> and all the rulers of the congregation came and told Moses.
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C16V23">&nbsp;</a>And he said unto them, This
<span class="add">is that</span> which the LORD hath said, To morrow
<span class="add">is</span> the rest of the holy sabbath unto the LORD: bake
<span class="add">that</span> which ye will bake
<span class="add">to day,</span> and seethe that ye will seethe; and that which remaineth over lay up for you to be kept until the morning.
 <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C16V24">&nbsp;</a>And they laid it up till the morning, as Moses bade: and it did not stink, neither was there any worm
therein.
 <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C16V25">&nbsp;</a>And Moses said, Eat that to day; for to day
<span class="add">is</span> a sabbath unto the LORD: to day ye shall not find it in the field.
 <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C16V26">&nbsp;</a>Six days ye shall gather it; but on the seventh day,
<span class="add">which is
</span> the sabbath, in it there shall be none.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C16V27">&nbsp;</a>And it came to pass,
<span class="add">that</span> there went out
<span class="add">some</span> of the people on the seventh day for to gather, and they found none.
 <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C16V28">&nbsp;</a>And the LORD said unto Moses, How long refuse ye to keep my commandments and my laws?
 <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C16V29">&nbsp;</a>See, for that the LORD hath given you the sabbath, therefore he giveth you on the sixth day the bread
of two days; abide ye every man in his place, let no man go out of his place on the seventh day.
 <span class="verse"> 30</span><a name="C16V30">&nbsp;</a>So the people rested on the seventh day.
 <span class="verse"> 31</span><a name="C16V31">&nbsp;</a>And the house of Israel called the name thereof Manna: and it
<span class="add">was</span> like coriander seed, white; and the taste of it
<span class="add">was
</span> like wafers
<span class="add">made</span> with honey.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 32</span><a name="C16V32">&nbsp;</a>And Moses said, This
<span class="add">is</span> the thing which the LORD commandeth, Fill an omer of it to be kept for your generations; that they may
see the bread wherewith I have fed you in the wilderness, when I brought you forth from the land of Egypt.
 <span class="verse"> 33</span><a name="C16V33">&nbsp;</a>And Moses said unto Aaron, Take a pot, and put an omer full of manna therein, and lay it up before the
LORD, to be kept for your generations.
 <span class="verse"> 34</span><a name="C16V34">&nbsp;</a>As the LORD commanded Moses, so Aaron laid it up before the Testimony, to be kept.
 <span class="verse"> 35</span><a name="C16V35">&nbsp;</a>And the children of Israel did eat manna forty years, until they came to a land inhabited; they did eat
manna, until they came unto the borders of the land of Canaan.
 <span class="verse"> 36</span><a name="C16V36">&nbsp;</a>Now an omer
<span class="add">is</span> the tenth
<span class="add">part</span> of an ephah.
