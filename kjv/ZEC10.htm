 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C10V1">&nbsp;</a>Ask ye of the LORD rain in the time of the latter rain;
<span class="add">so</span> the LORD shall make bright clouds, and give them showers of rain, to every one grass in the field.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C10V2">&nbsp;</a>For the idols have spoken vanity, and the diviners have seen a lie, and have told false dreams; they
comfort in vain: therefore they went their way as a flock, they were troubled, because
<span class="add">there was</span> no shepherd.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C10V3">&nbsp;</a>Mine anger was kindled against the shepherds, and I punished the goats: for the LORD of hosts hath visited
his flock the house of Judah, and hath made them as his goodly horse in the battle.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C10V4">&nbsp;</a>Out of him came forth the corner, out of him the nail, out of him the battle bow, out of him every oppressor
together.

<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C10V5">&nbsp;</a>And they shall be as mighty
<span class="add">men,</span> which tread down
<span class="add">their enemies</span> in the mire of the streets in the battle: and they shall fight, because the LORD
<span class="add">is</span> with them, and the riders on horses shall be confounded.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C10V6">&nbsp;</a>And I will strengthen the house of Judah, and I will save the house of Joseph, and I will bring them
again to place them; for I have mercy upon them: and they shall be as though I had not cast them off:
for I
<span class="add">am</span> the LORD their God, and will hear them.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C10V7">&nbsp;</a>And
<span class="add">they of</span> Ephraim shall be like a mighty
<span class="add">man,</span> and their heart shall rejoice as through wine: yea, their children shall see
<span class="add">it,</span> and be glad; their heart shall rejoice in the LORD.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C10V8">&nbsp;</a>I will hiss for them, and gather them; for I have redeemed them: and they shall increase as they have
increased.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C10V9">&nbsp;</a>And I will sow them among the people: and they shall remember me in far countries; and they shall live
with their children, and turn again.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C10V10">&nbsp;</a>I will bring them again also out of the land of Egypt, and gather them out of Assyria; and I will bring
them into the land of Gilead and Lebanon; and
<span class="add">place</span> shall not be found for them.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C10V11">&nbsp;</a>And he shall pass through the sea with affliction, and shall smite the waves in the sea, and all the
deeps of the river shall dry up: and the pride of Assyria shall be brought down, and the sceptre of Egypt
shall depart away.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C10V12">&nbsp;</a>And I will strengthen them in the LORD; and they shall walk up and down in his name, saith the LORD.
