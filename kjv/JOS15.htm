 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C15V1">&nbsp;</a><span class="add">This</span> then was the lot of the tribe of the children of Judah by their families;
<span class="add">even</span> to the border of Edom the wilderness of Zin southward
<span class="add">was</span> the uttermost part of the south coast.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C15V2">&nbsp;</a>And their south border was from the shore of the salt sea, from the bay that looketh southward:
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C15V3">&nbsp;</a>And it went out to the south side to Maaleh-acrabbim, and passed along to Zin, and ascended up on the
south side unto Kadesh-barnea, and passed along to Hezron, and went up to Adar, and fetched a compass
to Karkaa:
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C15V4">&nbsp;</a><span class="add">From thence</span> it passed toward Azmon, and went out unto the river of Egypt; and the goings out of that coast were
at the sea: this shall be your south coast.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C15V5">&nbsp;</a>And the east border
<span class="add">was</span> the salt sea,
<span class="add">even</span> unto the end of Jordan. And
<span class="add">their</span> border in the north quarter
<span class="add">was</span> from the bay of the sea at the uttermost part of Jordan:
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C15V6">&nbsp;</a>And the border went up to Beth-hogla, and passed along by the north of Beth-arabah; and the border went
up to the stone of Bohan the son of Reuben:
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C15V7">&nbsp;</a>And the border went up toward Debir from the valley of Achor, and so northward, looking toward Gilgal,
<span class="add">that is</span> before the going up to Adummim, which
<span class="add">is</span> on the south side of the river: and the border passed toward the waters of En-shemesh, and the goings
out thereof were at En-rogel:
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C15V8">&nbsp;</a>And the border went up by the valley of the son of Hinnom unto the south side of the Jebusite; the same
<span class="add">is</span> Jerusalem: and the border went up to the top of the mountain that
<span class="add">lieth</span> before the valley of Hinnom westward, which
<span class="add">is</span> at the end of the valley of the giants northward:
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C15V9">&nbsp;</a>And the border was drawn from the top of the hill unto the fountain of the water of Nephtoah, and went
out to the cities of mount Ephron; and the border was drawn to Baalah, which
<span class="add">is</span> Kirjath-jearim:
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C15V10">&nbsp;</a>And the border compassed from Baalah westward unto mount Seir, and passed along unto the side of mount
Jearim, which
<span class="add">is</span> Chesalon, on the north side, and went down to Beth-shemesh, and passed on to Timnah:
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C15V11">&nbsp;</a>And the border went out unto the side of Ekron northward: and the border was drawn to Shicron, and passed
along to mount Baalah, and went out unto Jabneel; and the goings out of the border were at the sea.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C15V12">&nbsp;</a>And the west border
<span class="add">was</span> to the great sea, and the coast
<span class="add">thereof.</span> This
<span class="add">is</span> the coast of the children of Judah round about according to their families.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C15V13">&nbsp;</a>And unto Caleb the son of Jephunneh he gave a part among the children of Judah, according to the commandment
of the LORD to Joshua,
<span class="add">even</span> the city of Arba the father of Anak, which
<span class="add">city is</span> Hebron.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C15V14">&nbsp;</a>And Caleb drove thence the three sons of Anak, Sheshai, and Ahiman, and Talmai, the children of Anak.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C15V15">&nbsp;</a>And he went up thence to the inhabitants of Debir: and the name of Debir before
<span class="add">was</span> Kirjath-sepher.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C15V16">&nbsp;</a>And Caleb said, He that smiteth Kirjath-sepher, and taketh it, to him will I give Achsah my daughter
to wife.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C15V17">&nbsp;</a>And Othniel the son of Kenaz, the brother of Caleb, took it: and he gave him Achsah his daughter to wife.
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C15V18">&nbsp;</a>And it came to pass, as she came
<span class="add">unto him,</span> that she moved him to ask of her father a field: and she lighted off
<span class="add">her</span> ass; and Caleb said unto her, What wouldest thou?
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C15V19">&nbsp;</a>Who answered, Give me a blessing; for thou hast given me a south land; give me also springs of water.
And he gave her the upper springs, and the nether springs.
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C15V20">&nbsp;</a>This
