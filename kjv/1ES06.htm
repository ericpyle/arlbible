<div class="chapterlabel"> 6</div><div class="p">
 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C6V1">&nbsp;</a>Now in the second year of the reign of Darius Aggeus and Zacharias the son of Addo, the prophets, prophesied
unto the Jews in Jewry and Jerusalem in the name of the Lord God of Israel, which was upon them.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C6V2">&nbsp;</a>Then stood up Zorobabel the son of Salatiel, and Jesus the son of Josedec, and began to build the house
of the Lord at Jerusalem, the prophets of the Lord being with them, and helping them.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C6V3">&nbsp;</a>At the same time came unto them Sisinnes the governor of Syria and Phenice, with Sathrabuzanes and his
companions, and said unto them,
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C6V4">&nbsp;</a>By whose appointment do ye build this house and this roof, and perform all the other things? and who
are the workmen that perform these things?
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C6V5">&nbsp;</a>Nevertheless the elders of the Jews obtained favour, because the Lord had visited the captivity;
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C6V6">&nbsp;</a>And they were not hindered from building, until such time as signification was given unto Darius concerning
them, and an answer received.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C6V7">&nbsp;</a>The copy of the letters which Sisinnes, governor of Syria and Phenice, and Sathrabuzanes, with their
companions, rulers in Syria and Phenice, wrote and sent unto Darius; To king Darius, greeting:
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C6V8">&nbsp;</a>Let all things be known unto our lord the king, that being come into the country of Judea, and entered
into the city of Jerusalem we found in the city of Jerusalem the ancients of the Jews that were of the
captivity
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C6V9">&nbsp;</a>Building an house unto the Lord, great and new, of hewn and costly stones, and the timber already laid
upon the walls.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C6V10">&nbsp;</a>And those works are done with great speed, and the work goeth on prosperously in their hands, and with
all glory and diligence is it made.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C6V11">&nbsp;</a>Then asked we these elders, saying, By whose commandment build ye this house, and lay the foundations
of these works?
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C6V12">&nbsp;</a>Therefore to the intent that we might give knowledge unto thee by writing, we demanded of them who were
the chief doers, and we required of them the names in writing of their principal men.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C6V13">&nbsp;</a>So they gave us this answer, We are the servants of the Lord which made heaven and earth.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C6V14">&nbsp;</a>And as for this house, it was builded many years ago by a king of Israel great and strong, and was finished.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C6V15">&nbsp;</a>But when our fathers provoked God unto wrath, and sinned against the Lord of Israel which is in heaven,
he gave them over into the power of Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon, of the Chaldees;
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C6V16">&nbsp;</a>Who pulled down the house, and burned it, and carried away the people captives unto Babylon.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C6V17">&nbsp;</a>But in the first year that king Cyrus reigned over the country of Babylon Cyrus the king wrote to build
up this house.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C6V18">&nbsp;</a>And the holy vessels of gold and of silver, that Nabuchodonosor had carried away out of the house at
Jerusalem, and had set them in his own temple those Cyrus the king brought forth again out of the temple
at Babylon, and they were delivered to Zorobabel and to Sanabassarus the ruler,
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C6V19">&nbsp;</a>With commandment that he should carry away the same vessels, and put them in the temple at Jerusalem;
and that the temple of the Lord should be built in his place.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C6V20">&nbsp;</a>Then the same Sanabassarus, being come hither, laid the foundations of the house of the Lord at Jerusalem;
and from that time to this being still a building, it is not yet fully ended.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C6V21">&nbsp;</a>Now therefore, if it seem good unto the king, let search be made among the records of king Cyrus:
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C6V22">&nbsp;</a>And if it be found that the building of the house of the Lord at Jerusalem hath been done with the consent
of king Cyrus, and if our lord the king be so minded, let him signify unto us thereof.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C6V23">&nbsp;</a>Then commanded king Darius to seek among the records at Babylon: and so at Ecbatane the palace, which
is in the country of Media, there was found a roll wherein these things were recorded.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C6V24">&nbsp;</a>In the first year of the reign of Cyrus king Cyrus commanded that the house of the Lord at Jerusalem
should be built again, where they do sacrifice with continual fire:
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C6V25">&nbsp;</a>Whose height shall be sixty cubits and the breadth sixty cubits, with three rows of hewn stones, and
one row of new wood of that country; and the expences thereof to be given out of the house of king Cyrus:
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C6V26">&nbsp;</a>And that the holy vessels of the house of the Lord, both of gold and silver, that Nabuchodonosor took
out of the house at Jerusalem, and brought to Babylon, should be restored to the house at Jerusalem,
and be set in the place where they were before.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C6V27">&nbsp;</a>And also he commanded that Sisinnes the governor of Syria and Phenice, and Sathrabuzanes, and their companions,
and those which were appointed rulers in Syria and Phenice, should be careful not to meddle with the
place, but suffer Zorobabel, the servant of the Lord, and governor of Judea, and the elders of the Jews,
to build the house of the Lord in that place.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C6V28">&nbsp;</a>I have commanded also to have it built up whole again; and that they look diligently to help those that
be of the captivity of the Jews, till the house of the Lord be finished:
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C6V29">&nbsp;</a>And out of the tribute of Celosyria and Phenice a portion carefully to be given these men for the sacrifices
of the Lord, that is, to Zorobabel the governor, for bullocks, and rams, and lambs;
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 30</span><a name="C6V30">&nbsp;</a>And also corn, salt, wine, and oil, and that continually every year without further question, according
as the priests that be in Jerusalem shall signify to be daily spent:
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 31</span><a name="C6V31">&nbsp;</a>That offerings may be made to the most high God for the king and for his children, and that they may
pray for their lives.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 32</span><a name="C6V32">&nbsp;</a>And he commanded that whosoever should transgress, yea, or make light of any thing afore spoken or written,
out of his own house should a tree be taken, and he thereon be hanged, and all his goods seized for the
king.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 33</span><a name="C6V33">&nbsp;</a>The Lord therefore, whose name is there called upon, utterly destroy every king and nation, that stretcheth
out his hand to hinder or endamage that house of the Lord in Jerusalem.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 34</span><a name="C6V34">&nbsp;</a>I Darius the king have ordained that according unto these things it be done with diligence.
