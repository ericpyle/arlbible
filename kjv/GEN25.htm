 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C25V1">&nbsp;</a>Then again Abraham took a wife, and her name
<span class="add">was</span> Keturah.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C25V2">&nbsp;</a>And she bare him Zimran, and Jokshan, and Medan, and Midian, and Ishbak, and Shuah.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C25V3">&nbsp;</a>And Jokshan begat Sheba, and Dedan. And the sons of Dedan were Asshurim, and Letushim, and Leummim.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C25V4">&nbsp;</a>And the sons of Midian; Ephah, and Epher, and Hanoch, and Abidah, and Eldaah. All these
<span class="add">were</span> the children of Keturah.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C25V5">&nbsp;</a>And Abraham gave all that he had unto Isaac.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C25V6">&nbsp;</a>But unto the sons of the concubines, which Abraham had, Abraham gave gifts, and sent them away from Isaac
his son, while he yet lived, eastward, unto the east country.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C25V7">&nbsp;</a>And these
<span class="add">are</span> the days of the years of Abraham’s life which he lived, an hundred threescore and fifteen years.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C25V8">&nbsp;</a>Then Abraham gave up the ghost, and died in a good old age, an old man, and full
<span class="add">of years;</span> and was gathered to his people.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C25V9">&nbsp;</a>And his sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave of Machpelah, in the field of Ephron the son of
Zohar the Hittite, which
<span class="add">is</span> before Mamre;
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C25V10">&nbsp;</a>The field which Abraham purchased of the sons of Heth: there was Abraham buried, and Sarah his wife.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C25V11">&nbsp;</a>And it came to pass after the death of Abraham, that God blessed his son Isaac; and Isaac dwelt by the
well Lahai-roi.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C25V12">&nbsp;</a>Now these
<span class="add">are</span> the generations of Ishmael, Abraham’s son, whom Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah’s handmaid, bare unto Abraham:
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C25V13">&nbsp;</a>And these
<span class="add">are</span> the names of the sons of Ishmael, by their names, according to their generations: the firstborn of Ishmael,
Nebajoth; and Kedar, and Adbeel, and Mibsam,
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C25V14">&nbsp;</a>And Mishma, and Dumah, and Massa,
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C25V15">&nbsp;</a>Hadar, and Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah:
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C25V16">&nbsp;</a>These
<span class="add">are</span> the sons of Ishmael, and these
<span class="add">are</span> their names, by their towns, and by their castles; twelve princes according to their nations.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C25V17">&nbsp;</a>And these
<span class="add">are</span> the years of the life of Ishmael, an hundred and thirty and seven years: and he gave up the ghost and
died; and was gathered unto his people.
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C25V18">&nbsp;</a>And they dwelt from Havilah unto Shur, that
<span class="add">is</span> before Egypt, as thou goest toward Assyria:
<span class="add">and</span> he died in the presence of all his brethren.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C25V19">&nbsp;</a>And these
<span class="add">are</span> the generations of Isaac, Abraham’s son: Abraham begat Isaac:
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C25V20">&nbsp;</a>And Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah to wife, the daughter of Bethuel the Syrian of Padan-aram,
the sister to Laban the Syrian.
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C25V21">&nbsp;</a>And Isaac intreated the LORD for his wife, because she
<span class="add">was
</span> barren: and the LORD was intreated of him, and Rebekah his wife conceived.
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C25V22">&nbsp;</a>And the children struggled together within her; and she said, If
<span class="add">it be</span> so, why
<span class="add">am</span> I thus? And she went to enquire of the LORD.
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C25V23">&nbsp;</a>And the LORD said unto her, Two nations
<span class="add">are</span> in thy womb, and two manner of people shall be separated from thy bowels; and
<span class="add">the one
</span> people shall be stronger than
<span class="add">the other</span> people; and the elder shall serve the younger.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C25V24">&nbsp;</a>And when her days to be delivered were fulfilled, behold,
<span class="add">there were</span> twins in her womb.
 <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C25V25">&nbsp;</a>And the first came out red, all over like an hairy garment; and they called his name Esau.
 <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C25V26">&nbsp;</a>And after that came his brother out, and his hand took hold on Esau’s heel; and his name was called Jacob:
and Isaac
<span class="add">was</span> threescore years old when she bare them.
 <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C25V27">&nbsp;</a>And the boys grew: and Esau was a cunning hunter, a man of the field; and Jacob
<span class="add">was</span> a plain man, dwelling in tents.
 <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C25V28">&nbsp;</a>And Isaac loved Esau, because he did eat of
<span class="add">his</span> venison: but Rebekah loved Jacob.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C25V29">&nbsp;</a>And Jacob sod pottage: and Esau came from the field, and he
<span class="add">was
</span> faint:
 <span class="verse"> 30</span><a name="C25V30">&nbsp;</a>And Esau said to Jacob, Feed me, I pray thee, with that same red
<span class="add">pottage;</span> for I
<span class="add">am</span> faint: therefore was his name called Edom.
 <span class="verse"> 31</span><a name="C25V31">&nbsp;</a>And Jacob said, Sell me this day thy birthright.
 <span class="verse"> 32</span><a name="C25V32">&nbsp;</a>And Esau said, Behold, I
<span class="add">am</span> at the point to die: and what profit shall this birthright do to me?
 <span class="verse"> 33</span><a name="C25V33">&nbsp;</a>And Jacob said, Swear to me this day; and he sware unto him: and he sold his birthright unto Jacob.
 <span class="verse"> 34</span><a name="C25V34">&nbsp;</a>Then Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage of lentiles; and he did eat and drink, and rose up, and went his
way: thus Esau despised
<span class="add">his</span> birthright.
