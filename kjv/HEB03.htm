 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C3V1">&nbsp;</a>Wherefore, holy brethren, partakers of the heavenly calling, consider the Apostle and High Priest of
our profession, Christ Jesus;
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C3V2">&nbsp;</a>Who was faithful to him that appointed him, as also Moses
<span class="add">was faithful</span> in all his house.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C3V3">&nbsp;</a>For this
<span class="add">man</span> was counted worthy of more glory than Moses, inasmuch as he who hath builded the house hath more honour
than the house.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C3V4">&nbsp;</a>For every house is builded by some
<span class="add">man;</span> but he that built all things
<span class="add">is</span> God.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C3V5">&nbsp;</a>And Moses verily
<span class="add">was</span> faithful in all his house, as a servant, for a testimony of those things which were to be spoken after;
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C3V6">&nbsp;</a>But Christ as a son over his own house; whose house are we, if we hold fast the confidence and the rejoicing
of the hope firm unto the end.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C3V7">&nbsp;</a>Wherefore (as the Holy Ghost saith, To day if ye will hear his voice,
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C3V8">&nbsp;</a>Harden not your hearts, as in the provocation, in the day of temptation in the wilderness:
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C3V9">&nbsp;</a>When your fathers tempted me, proved me, and saw my works forty years.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C3V10">&nbsp;</a>Wherefore I was grieved with that generation, and said, They do alway err in
<span class="add">their</span> heart; and they have not known my ways.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C3V11">&nbsp;</a>So I sware in my wrath, They shall not enter into my rest.)
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C3V12">&nbsp;</a>Take heed, brethren, lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief, in departing from the living
God.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C3V13">&nbsp;</a>But exhort one another daily, while it is called To day; lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness
of sin.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C3V14">&nbsp;</a>For we are made partakers of Christ, if we hold the beginning of our confidence stedfast unto the end;
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C3V15">&nbsp;</a>While it is said, To day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts, as in the provocation.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C3V16">&nbsp;</a>For some, when they had heard, did provoke: howbeit not all that came out of Egypt by Moses.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C3V17">&nbsp;</a>But with whom was he grieved forty years?
<span class="add">was it</span> not with them that had sinned, whose carcases fell in the wilderness?
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C3V18">&nbsp;</a>And to whom sware he that they should not enter into his rest, but to them that believed not?
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C3V19">&nbsp;</a>So we see that they could not enter in because of unbelief.
