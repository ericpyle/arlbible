 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C4V1">&nbsp;</a>But it displeased Jonah exceedingly, and he was very angry.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C4V2">&nbsp;</a>And he prayed unto the LORD, and said, I pray thee, O LORD,
<span class="add">was</span> not this my saying, when I was yet in my country? Therefore I fled before unto Tarshish: for I knew
that thou
<span class="add">art</span> a gracious God, and merciful, slow to anger, and of great kindness, and repentest thee of the evil.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C4V3">&nbsp;</a>Therefore now, O LORD, take, I beseech thee, my life from me; for
<span class="add">it is</span> better for me to die than to live.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C4V4">&nbsp;</a>Then said the LORD, Doest thou well to be angry?
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C4V5">&nbsp;</a>So Jonah went out of the city, and sat on the east side of the city, and there made him a booth, and
sat under it in the shadow, till he might see what would become of the city.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C4V6">&nbsp;</a>And the LORD God prepared a gourd, and made
<span class="add">it</span> to come up over Jonah, that it might be a shadow over his head, to deliver him from his grief. So Jonah
was exceeding glad of the gourd.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C4V7">&nbsp;</a>But God prepared a worm when the morning rose the next day, and it smote the gourd that it withered.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C4V8">&nbsp;</a>And it came to pass, when the sun did arise, that God prepared a vehement east wind; and the sun beat
upon the head of Jonah, that he fainted, and wished in himself to die, and said,
<span class="add">It is</span> better for me to die than to live.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C4V9">&nbsp;</a>And God said to Jonah, Doest thou well to be angry for the gourd? And he said, I do well to be angry,
<span class="add">even</span> unto death.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C4V10">&nbsp;</a>Then said the LORD, Thou hast had pity on the gourd, for the which thou hast not laboured, neither madest
it grow; which came up in a night, and perished in a night:
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C4V11">&nbsp;</a>And should not I spare Nineveh, that great city, wherein are more than sixscore thousand persons that
cannot discern between their right hand and their left hand; and
<span class="add">also</span> much cattle?
