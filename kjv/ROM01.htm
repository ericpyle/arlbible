<div class="mt1">The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans
</div>
<div class="chapterlabel"> 1</div><div class="p">
 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C1V1">&nbsp;</a>Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, called
<span class="add">to be</span> an apostle, separated unto the gospel of God,
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C1V2">&nbsp;</a>(Which he had promised afore by his prophets in the holy scriptures,)
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C1V3">&nbsp;</a>Concerning his Son Jesus Christ our Lord, which was made of the seed of David according to the flesh;
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C1V4">&nbsp;</a>And declared
<span class="add">to be</span> the Son of God with power, according to the spirit of holiness, by the resurrection from the dead:
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C1V5">&nbsp;</a>By whom we have received grace and apostleship, for obedience to the faith among all nations, for his
name:
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C1V6">&nbsp;</a>Among whom are ye also the called of Jesus Christ:
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C1V7">&nbsp;</a>To all that be in Rome, beloved of God, called
<span class="add">to be</span> saints: Grace to you and peace from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C1V8">&nbsp;</a>First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for you all, that your faith is spoken of throughout the whole
world.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C1V9">&nbsp;</a>For God is my witness, whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel of his Son, that without ceasing I make
mention of you always in my prayers;
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C1V10">&nbsp;</a>Making request, if by any means now at length I might have a prosperous journey by the will of God to
come unto you.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C1V11">&nbsp;</a>For I long to see you, that I may impart unto you some spiritual gift, to the end ye may be established;
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C1V12">&nbsp;</a>That is, that I may be comforted together with you by the mutual faith both of you and me.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C1V13">&nbsp;</a>Now I would not have you ignorant, brethren, that oftentimes I purposed to come unto you, (but was let
hitherto,) that I might have some fruit among you also, even as among other Gentiles.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C1V14">&nbsp;</a>I am debtor both to the Greeks, and to the Barbarians; both to the wise, and to the unwise.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C1V15">&nbsp;</a>So, as much as in me is, I am ready to preach the gospel to you that are at Rome also.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C1V16">&nbsp;</a>For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one
that believeth; to the Jew first, and also to the Greek.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C1V17">&nbsp;</a>For therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith: as it is written, The just shall
live by faith.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C1V18">&nbsp;</a>For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who
hold the truth in unrighteousness;
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C1V19">&nbsp;</a>Because that which may be known of God is manifest in them; for God hath shewed
<span class="add">it</span> unto them.
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C1V20">&nbsp;</a>For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by
the things that are made,
<span class="add">even
</span> his eternal power and Godhead; so that they are without excuse:
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C1V21">&nbsp;</a>Because that, when they knew God, they glorified
<span class="add">him</span> not as God, neither were thankful; but became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was
darkened.
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C1V22">&nbsp;</a>Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools,
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C1V23">&nbsp;</a>And changed the glory of the uncorruptible God into an image made like to corruptible man, and to birds,
and fourfooted beasts, and creeping things.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C1V24">&nbsp;</a>Wherefore God also gave them up to uncleanness through the lusts of their own hearts, to dishonour their
own bodies between themselves:
 <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C1V25">&nbsp;</a>Who changed the truth of God into a lie, and worshipped and served the creature more than the Creator,
who is blessed for ever. Amen.
 <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C1V26">&nbsp;</a>For this cause God gave them up unto vile affections: for even their women did change the natural use
into that which is against nature:
 <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C1V27">&nbsp;</a>And likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one toward another;
men with men working that which is unseemly, and receiving in themselves that recompence of their error
which was meet.
 <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C1V28">&nbsp;</a>And even as they did not like to retain God in
<span class="add">their</span> knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate mind, to do those things which are not convenient;
 <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C1V29">&nbsp;</a>Being filled with all unrighteousness, fornication, wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness; full of
envy, murder, debate, deceit, malignity; whisperers,
 <span class="verse"> 30</span><a name="C1V30">&nbsp;</a>Backbiters, haters of God, despiteful, proud, boasters, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents,
 <span class="verse"> 31</span><a name="C1V31">&nbsp;</a>Without understanding, covenantbreakers, without natural affection, implacable, unmerciful:
 <span class="verse"> 32</span><a name="C1V32">&nbsp;</a>Who knowing the judgment of God, that they which commit such things are worthy of death, not only do
the same, but have pleasure in them that do them.
