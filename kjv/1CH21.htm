 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C21V1">&nbsp;</a>And Satan stood up against Israel, and provoked David to number Israel.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C21V2">&nbsp;</a>And David said to Joab and to the rulers of the people, Go, number Israel from Beer-sheba even to Dan;
and bring the number of them to me, that I may know
<span class="add">it.
</span> <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C21V3">&nbsp;</a>And Joab answered, The LORD make his people an hundred times so many more as they
<span class="add">be:</span> but, my lord the king,
<span class="add">are</span> they not all my lord’s servants? why then doth my lord require this thing? why will he be a cause of
trespass to Israel?
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C21V4">&nbsp;</a>Nevertheless the king’s word prevailed against Joab. Wherefore Joab departed, and went throughout all
Israel, and came to Jerusalem.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C21V5">&nbsp;</a>And Joab gave the sum of the number of the people unto David. And all
<span class="add">they of</span> Israel were a thousand thousand and an hundred thousand men that drew sword: and Judah
<span class="add">was</span> four hundred threescore and ten thousand men that drew sword.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C21V6">&nbsp;</a>But Levi and Benjamin counted he not among them: for the king’s word was abominable to Joab.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C21V7">&nbsp;</a>And God was displeased with this thing; therefore he smote Israel.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C21V8">&nbsp;</a>And David said unto God, I have sinned greatly, because I have done this thing: but now, I beseech thee,
do away the iniquity of thy servant; for I have done very foolishly.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C21V9">&nbsp;</a>And the LORD spake unto Gad, David’s seer, saying,
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C21V10">&nbsp;</a>Go and tell David, saying, Thus saith the LORD, I offer thee three
<span class="add">things:</span> choose thee one of them, that I may do
<span class="add">it</span> unto thee.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C21V11">&nbsp;</a>So Gad came to David, and said unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Choose thee
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C21V12">&nbsp;</a>Either three years’ famine; or three months to be destroyed before thy foes, while that the sword of
thine enemies overtaketh
<span class="add">thee;</span> or else three days the sword of the LORD, even the pestilence, in the land, and the angel of the LORD
destroying throughout all the coasts of Israel. Now therefore advise thyself what word I shall bring
again to him that sent me.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C21V13">&nbsp;</a>And David said unto Gad, I am in a great strait: let me fall now into the hand of the LORD; for very
great
<span class="add">are</span> his mercies: but let me not fall into the hand of man.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C21V14">&nbsp;</a>So the LORD sent pestilence upon Israel: and there fell of Israel seventy thousand men.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C21V15">&nbsp;</a>And God sent an angel unto Jerusalem to destroy it: and as he was destroying, the LORD beheld, and he
repented him of the evil, and said to the angel that destroyed, It is enough, stay now thine hand. And
the angel of the LORD stood by the threshingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C21V16">&nbsp;</a>And David lifted up his eyes, and saw the angel of the LORD stand between the earth and the heaven, having
a drawn sword in his hand stretched out over Jerusalem. Then David and the elders
<span class="add">of Israel, who were</span> clothed in sackcloth, fell upon their faces.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C21V17">&nbsp;</a>And David said unto God,
<span class="add">Is it</span> not I
<span class="add">that</span> commanded the people to be numbered? even I it is that have sinned and done evil indeed; but
<span class="add">as for</span> these sheep, what have they done? let thine hand, I pray thee, O LORD my God, be on me, and on my father’s
house; but not on thy people, that they should be plagued.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C21V18">&nbsp;</a>Then the angel of the LORD commanded Gad to say to David, that David should go up, and set up an altar
unto the LORD in the threshingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite.
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C21V19">&nbsp;</a>And David went up at the saying of Gad, which he spake in the name of the LORD.
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C21V20">&nbsp;</a>And Ornan turned back, and saw the angel; and his four sons with him hid themselves. Now Ornan was threshing
wheat.
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C21V21">&nbsp;</a>And as David came to Ornan, Ornan looked and saw David, and went out of the threshingfloor, and bowed
himself to David with
<span class="add">his</span> face to the ground.
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C21V22">&nbsp;</a>Then David said to Ornan, Grant me the place of
<span class="add">this</span> threshingfloor, that I may build an altar therein unto the LORD: thou shalt grant it me for the full
price: that the plague may be stayed from the people.
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C21V23">&nbsp;</a>And Ornan said unto David, Take
<span class="add">it</span> to thee, and let my lord the king do
<span class="add">that which is</span> good in his eyes: lo, I give
<span class="add">thee</span> the oxen
<span class="add">also</span> for burnt offerings, and the threshing instruments for wood, and the wheat for the meat offering; I
give it all.
 <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C21V24">&nbsp;</a>And king David said to Ornan, Nay; but I will verily buy it for the full price: for I will not take
<span class="add">that</span> which
<span class="add">is</span> thine for the LORD, nor offer burnt offerings without cost.
 <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C21V25">&nbsp;</a>So David gave to Ornan for the place six hundred shekels of gold by weight.
 <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C21V26">&nbsp;</a>And David built there an altar unto the LORD, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings, and called
upon the LORD; and he answered him from heaven by fire upon the altar of burnt offering.
 <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C21V27">&nbsp;</a>And the LORD commanded the angel; and he put up his sword again into the sheath thereof.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C21V28">&nbsp;</a>At that time when David saw that the LORD had answered him in the threshingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite,
then he sacrificed there.
 <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C21V29">&nbsp;</a>For the tabernacle of the LORD, which Moses made in the wilderness, and the altar of the burnt offering,
<span class="add">were</span> at that season in the high place at Gibeon.
 <span class="verse"> 30</span><a name="C21V30">&nbsp;</a>But David could not go before it to enquire of God: for he was afraid because of the sword of the angel
of the LORD.
