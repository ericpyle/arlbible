 <span class="verse" id="V1">1&nbsp;</span>The word of the LORD came again unto me, saying,  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span>Now, thou son of man, take up a lamentation for Tyrus;  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>And say unto Tyrus, O thou that art situate at the entry of the sea, <span class='add'>which art</span> a merchant of the people for many isles, Thus saith the Lord GOD; O Tyrus, thou hast said, I <span class='add'>am</span> of perfect beauty.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>Thy borders <span class='add'>are</span> in the midst of the seas, thy builders have perfected thy beauty.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>They have made all thy <span class='add'>ship</span> boards of fir trees of Senir: they have taken cedars from Lebanon to make masts for thee.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span> <span class='add'>Of</span> the oaks of Bashan have they made thine oars; the company of the Ashurites have made thy benches <span class='add'>of</span> ivory, <span class='add'>brought</span> out of the isles of Chittim.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>Fine linen with broidered work from Egypt was that which thou spreadest forth to be thy sail; blue and purple from the isles of Elishah was that which covered thee.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>The inhabitants of Zidon and Arvad were thy mariners: thy wise <span class='add'>men</span>, O Tyrus, <span class='add'>that</span> were in thee, were thy pilots.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>The ancients of Gebal and the wise <span class='add'>men</span> thereof were in thee thy calkers: all the ships of the sea with their mariners were in thee to occupy thy merchandise.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>They of Persia and of Lud and of Phut were in thine army, thy men of war: they hanged the shield and helmet in thee; they set forth thy comeliness.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>The men of Arvad with thine army <span class='add'>were</span> upon thy walls round about, and the Gammadims were in thy towers: they hanged their shields upon thy walls round about; they have made thy beauty perfect.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>Tarshish <span class='add'>was</span> thy merchant by reason of the multitude of all <span class='add'>kind of</span> riches; with silver, iron, tin, and lead, they traded in thy fairs.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>Javan, Tubal, and Meshech, they <span class='add'>were</span> thy merchants: they traded the persons of men and vessels of brass in thy market.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>They of the house of Togarmah traded in thy fairs with horses and horsemen and mules.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>The men of Dedan <span class='add'>were</span> thy merchants; many isles <span class='add'>were</span> the merchandise of thine hand: they brought thee <span class='add'>for</span> a present horns of ivory and ebony.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>Syria <span class='add'>was</span> thy merchant by reason of the multitude of the wares of thy making: they occupied in thy fairs with emeralds, purple, and broidered work, and fine linen, and coral, and agate.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>Judah, and the land of Israel, they <span class='add'>were</span> thy merchants: they traded in thy market wheat of Minnith, and Pannag, and honey, and oil, and balm.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>Damascus <span class='add'>was</span> thy merchant in the multitude of the wares of thy making, for the multitude of all riches; in the wine of Helbon, and white wool.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>Dan also and Javan going to and fro occupied in thy fairs: bright iron, cassia, and calamus, were in thy market.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>Dedan <span class='add'>was</span> thy merchant in precious clothes for chariots.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>Arabia, and all the princes of Kedar, they occupied with thee in lambs, and rams, and goats: in these <span class='add'>were they</span> thy merchants.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>The merchants of Sheba and Raamah, they <span class='add'>were</span> thy merchants: they occupied in thy fairs with chief of all spices, and with all precious stones, and gold.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>Haran, and Canneh, and Eden, the merchants of Sheba, Asshur, <span class='add'>and</span> Chilmad, <span class='add'>were</span> thy merchants.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>These <span class='add'>were</span> thy merchants in all sorts <span class='add'>of things</span>, in blue clothes, and broidered work, and in chests of rich apparel, bound with cords, and made of cedar, among thy merchandise.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>The ships of Tarshish did sing of thee in thy market: and thou wast replenished, and made very glorious in the midst of the seas.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>Thy rowers have brought thee into great waters: the east wind hath broken thee in the midst of the seas.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>Thy riches, and thy fairs, thy merchandise, thy mariners, and thy pilots, thy calkers, and the occupiers of thy merchandise, and all thy men of war, that <span class='add'>are</span> in thee, and in all thy company which <span class='add'>is</span> in the midst of thee, shall fall into the midst of the seas in the day of thy ruin.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&nbsp;</span>The suburbs shall shake at the sound of the cry of thy pilots.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&nbsp;</span>And all that handle the oar, the mariners, <span class='add'>and</span> all the pilots of the sea, shall come down from their ships, they shall stand upon the land;  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&nbsp;</span>And shall cause their voice to be heard against thee, and shall cry bitterly, and shall cast up dust upon their heads, they shall wallow themselves in the ashes:  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&nbsp;</span>And they shall make themselves utterly bald for thee, and gird them with sackcloth, and they shall weep for thee with bitterness of heart <span class='add'>and</span> bitter wailing.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&nbsp;</span>And in their wailing they shall take up a lamentation for thee, and lament over thee, <span class='add'>saying</span>, What <span class='add'>city is</span> like Tyrus, like the destroyed in the midst of the sea?  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&nbsp;</span>When thy wares went forth out of the seas, thou filledst many people; thou didst enrich the kings of the earth with the multitude of thy riches and of thy merchandise.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&nbsp;</span>In the time <span class='add'>when</span> thou shalt be broken by the seas in the depths of the waters thy merchandise and all thy company in the midst of thee shall fall.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&nbsp;</span>All the inhabitants of the isles shall be astonished at thee, and their kings shall be sore afraid, they shall be troubled in <span class='add'>their</span> countenance.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&nbsp;</span>The merchants among the people shall hiss at thee; thou <span class='add'>shalt be</span> a terror, and never shalt be any more. </div><ul class='tnav'>
