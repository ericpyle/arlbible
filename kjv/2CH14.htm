 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C14V1">&nbsp;</a>So Abijah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city of David: and Asa his son reigned in
his stead. In his days the land was quiet ten years.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C14V2">&nbsp;</a>And Asa did
<span class="add">that which was</span> good and right in the eyes of the LORD his God:
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C14V3">&nbsp;</a>For he took away the altars of the strange
<span class="add">gods,</span> and the high places, and brake down the images, and cut down the groves:
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C14V4">&nbsp;</a>And commanded Judah to seek the LORD God of their fathers, and to do the law and the commandment.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C14V5">&nbsp;</a>Also he took away out of all the cities of Judah the high places and the images: and the kingdom was
quiet before him.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C14V6">&nbsp;</a>And he built fenced cities in Judah: for the land had rest, and he had no war in those years; because
the LORD had given him rest.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C14V7">&nbsp;</a>Therefore he said unto Judah, Let us build these cities, and make about
<span class="add">them</span> walls, and towers, gates, and bars,
<span class="add">while</span> the land
<span class="add">is</span> yet before us; because we have sought the LORD our God, we have sought
<span class="add">him,</span> and he hath given us rest on every side. So they built and prospered.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C14V8">&nbsp;</a>And Asa had an army
<span class="add">of men</span> that bare targets and spears, out of Judah three hundred thousand; and out of Benjamin, that bare shields
and drew bows, two hundred and fourscore thousand: all these
<span class="add">were</span> mighty men of valour.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C14V9">&nbsp;</a>And there came out against them Zerah the Ethiopian with an host of a thousand thousand, and three hundred
chariots; and came unto Mareshah.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C14V10">&nbsp;</a>Then Asa went out against him, and they set the battle in array in the valley of Zephathah at Mareshah.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C14V11">&nbsp;</a>And Asa cried unto the LORD his God, and said, LORD,
<span class="add">it is
</span> nothing with thee to help, whether with many, or with them that have no power: help us, O LORD our God;
for we rest on thee, and in thy name we go against this multitude. O LORD, thou
<span class="add">art</span> our God; let not man prevail against thee.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C14V12">&nbsp;</a>So the LORD smote the Ethiopians before Asa and before Judah; and the Ethiopians fled.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C14V13">&nbsp;</a>And Asa and the people that
<span class="add">were</span> with him pursued them unto Gerar: and the Ethiopians were overthrown, that they could not recover themselves;
for they were destroyed before the LORD, and before his host; and they carried away very much spoil.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C14V14">&nbsp;</a>And they smote all the cities round about Gerar; for the fear of the LORD came upon them: and they spoiled
all the cities; for there was exceeding much spoil in them.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C14V15">&nbsp;</a>They smote also the tents of cattle, and carried away sheep and camels in abundance, and returned to
Jerusalem.
