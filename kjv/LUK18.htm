 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C18V1">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And he spake a parable unto them
</span><span class="add">to this end,</span><span class="wj"> that men ought always to pray, and not to faint;
</span> <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C18V2">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Saying, There was in a city a judge, which feared not God, neither regarded man:
</span> <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C18V3">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And there was a widow in that city; and she came unto him, saying, Avenge me of mine adversary.
</span> <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C18V4">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And he would not for a while: but afterward he said within himself, Though I fear not God, nor regard
man;
</span> <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C18V5">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Yet because this widow troubleth me, I will avenge her, lest by her continual coming she weary me.
</span> <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C18V6">&nbsp;</a>And the Lord said,
<span class="wj">Hear what the unjust judge saith.
</span> <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C18V7">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And shall not God avenge his own elect, which cry day and night unto him, though he bear long with them?
</span> <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C18V8">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">I tell you that he will avenge them speedily. Nevertheless when the Son of man cometh, shall he find
faith on the earth?
</span> <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C18V9">&nbsp;</a>And he spake this parable unto certain which trusted in themselves that they were righteous, and despised
others:
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C18V10">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Two men went up into the temple to pray; the one a Pharisee, and the other a publican.
</span> <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C18V11">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">The Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself, God, I thank thee, that I am not as other men
</span><span class="add">are,</span><span class="wj"> extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even as this publican.
</span> <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C18V12">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">I fast twice in the week, I give tithes of all that I possess.
</span> <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C18V13">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And the publican, standing afar off, would not lift up so much as
</span><span class="add">his</span><span class="wj"> eyes unto heaven, but smote upon his breast, saying, God be merciful to me a sinner.
</span> <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C18V14">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">I tell you, this man went down to his house justified
</span><span class="add">rather
</span><span class="wj"> than the other: for every one that exalteth himself shall be abased; and he that humbleth himself shall
be exalted.
</span> <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C18V15">&nbsp;</a>And they brought unto him also infants, that he would touch them: but when
<span class="add">his</span> disciples saw
<span class="add">it,</span> they rebuked them.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C18V16">&nbsp;</a>But Jesus called them
<span class="add">unto him,</span> and said,
<span class="wj">Suffer little children to come unto me, and forbid them not: for of such is the kingdom of God.
</span> <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C18V17">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Verily I say unto you, Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child shall in no wise
enter therein.
</span> <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C18V18">&nbsp;</a>And a certain ruler asked him, saying, Good Master, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C18V19">&nbsp;</a>And Jesus said unto him,
<span class="wj">Why callest thou me good? none
</span><span class="add">is
</span><span class="wj"> good, save one,
</span><span class="add">that is,</span><span class="wj"> God.
</span> <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C18V20">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Thou knowest the commandments, Do not commit adultery, Do not kill, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness,
Honour thy father and thy mother.
</span> <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C18V21">&nbsp;</a>And he said, All these have I kept from my youth up.
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C18V22">&nbsp;</a>Now when Jesus heard these things, he said unto him,
<span class="wj">Yet lackest thou one thing: sell all that thou hast, and distribute unto the poor, and thou shalt have
treasure in heaven: and come, follow me.
</span> <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C18V23">&nbsp;</a>And when he heard this, he was very sorrowful: for he was very rich.
 <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C18V24">&nbsp;</a>And when Jesus saw that he was very sorrowful, he said,
<span class="wj">How hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God!
</span> <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C18V25">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">For it is easier for a camel to go through a needle’s eye, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom
of God.
</span> <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C18V26">&nbsp;</a>And they that heard
<span class="add">it</span> said, Who then can be saved?
 <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C18V27">&nbsp;</a>And he said,
<span class="wj">The things which are impossible with men are possible with God.
</span> <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C18V28">&nbsp;</a>Then Peter said, Lo, we have left all, and followed thee.
 <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C18V29">&nbsp;</a>And he said unto them,
<span class="wj">Verily I say unto you, There is no man that hath left house, or parents, or brethren, or wife, or children,
for the kingdom of God’s sake,
</span> <span class="verse"> 30</span><a name="C18V30">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Who shall not receive manifold more in this present time, and in the world to come life everlasting.</span></div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 31</span><a name="C18V31">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Then he took
</span><span class="add">unto him</span><span class="wj"> the twelve, and said unto them, Behold, we go up to Jerusalem, and all things that are written by the
prophets concerning the Son of man shall be accomplished.
</span> <span class="verse"> 32</span><a name="C18V32">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">For he shall be delivered unto the Gentiles, and shall be mocked, and spitefully entreated, and spitted
on:
</span> <span class="verse"> 33</span><a name="C18V33">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And they shall scourge
</span><span class="add">him,</span><span class="wj"> and put him to death: and the third day he shall rise again.
</span> <span class="verse"> 34</span><a name="C18V34">&nbsp;</a>And they understood none of these things: and this saying was hid from them, neither knew they the things
which were spoken.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 35</span><a name="C18V35">&nbsp;</a>And it came to pass, that as he was come nigh unto Jericho, a certain blind man sat by the way side begging:
 <span class="verse"> 36</span><a name="C18V36">&nbsp;</a>And hearing the multitude pass by, he asked what it meant.
 <span class="verse"> 37</span><a name="C18V37">&nbsp;</a>And they told him, that Jesus of Nazareth passeth by.
 <span class="verse"> 38</span><a name="C18V38">&nbsp;</a>And he cried, saying, Jesus,
<span class="add">thou</span> Son of David, have mercy on me.
 <span class="verse"> 39</span><a name="C18V39">&nbsp;</a>And they which went before rebuked him, that he should hold his peace: but he cried so much the more,
<span class="add">Thou</span> Son of David, have mercy on me.
 <span class="verse"> 40</span><a name="C18V40">&nbsp;</a>And Jesus stood, and commanded him to be brought unto him: and when he was come near, he asked him,
 <span class="verse"> 41</span><a name="C18V41">&nbsp;</a>Saying,
<span class="wj">What wilt thou that I shall do unto thee?</span> And he said, Lord, that I may receive my sight.
 <span class="verse"> 42</span><a name="C18V42">&nbsp;</a>And Jesus said unto him,
<span class="wj">Receive thy sight: thy faith hath saved thee.
</span> <span class="verse"> 43</span><a name="C18V43">&nbsp;</a>And immediately he received his sight, and followed him, glorifying God: and all the people, when they
saw
<span class="add">it,</span> gave praise unto God.
