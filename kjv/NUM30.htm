 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C30V1">&nbsp;</a>And Moses spake unto the heads of the tribes concerning the children of Israel, saying, This is the thing
which the LORD hath commanded.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C30V2">&nbsp;</a>If a man vow a vow unto the LORD, or swear an oath to bind his soul with a bond; he shall not break his
word, he shall do according to all that proceedeth out of his mouth.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C30V3">&nbsp;</a>If a woman also vow a vow unto the LORD, and bind
<span class="add">herself
</span> by a bond,
<span class="add">being</span> in her father’s house in her youth;
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C30V4">&nbsp;</a>And her father hear her vow, and her bond wherewith she hath bound her soul, and her father shall hold
his peace at her: then all her vows shall stand, and every bond wherewith she hath bound her soul shall
stand.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C30V5">&nbsp;</a>But if her father disallow her in the day that he heareth; not any of her vows, or of her bonds wherewith
she hath bound her soul, shall stand: and the LORD shall forgive her, because her father disallowed her.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C30V6">&nbsp;</a>And if she had at all an husband, when she vowed, or uttered ought out of her lips, wherewith she bound
her soul;
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C30V7">&nbsp;</a>And her husband heard
<span class="add">it,</span> and held his peace at her in the day that he heard
<span class="add">it:</span> then her vows shall stand, and her bonds wherewith she bound her soul shall stand.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C30V8">&nbsp;</a>But if her husband disallowed her on the day that he heard
<span class="add">it;
</span> then he shall make her vow which she vowed, and that which she uttered with her lips, wherewith she
bound her soul, of none effect: and the LORD shall forgive her.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C30V9">&nbsp;</a>But every vow of a widow, and of her that is divorced, wherewith they have bound their souls, shall stand
against her.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C30V10">&nbsp;</a>And if she vowed in her husband’s house, or bound her soul by a bond with an oath;
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C30V11">&nbsp;</a>And her husband heard
<span class="add">it,</span> and held his peace at her,
<span class="add">and</span> disallowed her not: then all her vows shall stand, and every bond wherewith she bound her soul shall
stand.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C30V12">&nbsp;</a>But if her husband hath utterly made them void on the day he heard
<span class="add">them; then</span> whatsoever proceeded out of her lips concerning her vows, or concerning the bond of her soul, shall
not stand: her husband hath made them void; and the LORD shall forgive her.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C30V13">&nbsp;</a>Every vow, and every binding oath to afflict the soul, her husband may establish it, or her husband may
make it void.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C30V14">&nbsp;</a>But if her husband altogether hold his peace at her from day to day; then he establisheth all her vows,
or all her bonds, which
<span class="add">are
</span> upon her: he confirmeth them, because he held his peace at her in the day that he heard
<span class="add">them.
</span> <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C30V15">&nbsp;</a>But if he shall any ways make them void after that he hath heard
<span class="add">them;</span> then he shall bear her iniquity.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C30V16">&nbsp;</a>These
<span class="add">are</span> the statutes, which the LORD commanded Moses, between a man and his wife, between the father and his
daughter,
<span class="add">being yet</span> in her youth in her father’s house.
