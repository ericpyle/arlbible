 <span class="verse" id="V1">1&nbsp;</span>And Moses spake unto the heads of the tribes concerning the children of Israel, saying, This is the thing which the LORD hath commanded.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span>If a man vow a vow unto the LORD, or swear an oath to bind his soul with a bond; he shall not break his word, he shall do according to all that proceedeth out of his mouth.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>If a woman also vow a vow unto the LORD, and bind <span class='add'>herself</span> by a bond, <span class='add'>being</span> in her father’s house in her youth;  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>And her father hear her vow, and her bond wherewith she hath bound her soul, and her father shall hold his peace at her: then all her vows shall stand, and every bond wherewith she hath bound her soul shall stand.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>But if her father disallow her in the day that he heareth; not any of her vows, or of her bonds wherewith she hath bound her soul, shall stand: and the LORD shall forgive her, because her father disallowed her.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>And if she had at all an husband, when she vowed, or uttered ought out of her lips, wherewith she bound her soul;  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>And her husband heard <span class='add'>it</span>, and held his peace at her in the day that he heard <span class='add'>it:</span> then her vows shall stand, and her bonds wherewith she bound her soul shall stand.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>But if her husband disallowed her on the day that he heard <span class='add'>it;</span> then he shall make her vow which she vowed, and that which she uttered with her lips, wherewith she bound her soul, of none effect: and the LORD shall forgive her.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>But every vow of a widow, and of her that is divorced, wherewith they have bound their souls, shall stand against her.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>And if she vowed in her husband’s house, or bound her soul by a bond with an oath;  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>And her husband heard <span class='add'>it</span>, and held his peace at her, <span class='add'>and</span> disallowed her not: then all her vows shall stand, and every bond wherewith she bound her soul shall stand.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>But if her husband hath utterly made them void on the day he heard <span class='add'>them; then</span> whatsoever proceeded out of her lips concerning her vows, or concerning the bond of her soul, shall not stand: her husband hath made them void; and the LORD shall forgive her.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>Every vow, and every binding oath to afflict the soul, her husband may establish it, or her husband may make it void.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>But if her husband altogether hold his peace at her from day to day; then he establisheth all her vows, or all her bonds, which <span class='add'>are</span> upon her: he confirmeth them, because he held his peace at her in the day that he heard <span class='add'>them</span>.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>But if he shall any ways make them void after that he hath heard <span class='add'>them;</span> then he shall bear her iniquity.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>These <span class='add'>are</span> the statutes, which the LORD commanded Moses, between a man and his wife, between the father and his daughter, <span class='add'>being yet</span> in her youth in her father’s house. </div><ul class='tnav'>
