<div class="chapterlabel"> 4</div><div class="p">
 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C4V1">&nbsp;</a>Better it is to have no children, and to have virtue: for the memorial thereof is immortal: because it
is known with God, and with men.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C4V2">&nbsp;</a>When it is present, men take example at it; and when it is gone, they desire it: it weareth a crown,
and triumpheth for ever, having gotten the victory, striving for undefiled rewards.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C4V3">&nbsp;</a>But the multiplying brood of the ungodly shall not thrive, nor take deep rooting from bastard slips,
nor lay any fast foundation.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C4V4">&nbsp;</a>For though they flourish in branches for a time; yet standing not last, they shall be shaken with the
wind, and through the force of winds they shall be rooted out.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C4V5">&nbsp;</a>The imperfect branches shall be broken off, their fruit unprofitable, not ripe to eat, yea, meet for
nothing.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C4V6">&nbsp;</a>For children begotten of unlawful beds are witnesses of wickedness against their parents in their trial.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C4V7">&nbsp;</a>But though the righteous be prevented with death, yet shall he be in rest.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C4V8">&nbsp;</a>For honourable age is not that which standeth in length of time, nor that is measured by number of years.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C4V9">&nbsp;</a>But wisdom is the gray hair unto men, and an unspotted life is old age.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C4V10">&nbsp;</a>He pleased God, and was beloved of him: so that living among sinners he was translated.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C4V11">&nbsp;</a>Yea speedily was he taken away, lest that wickedness should alter his understanding, or deceit beguile
his soul.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C4V12">&nbsp;</a>For the bewitching of naughtiness doth obscure things that are honest; and the wandering of concupiscence
doth undermine the simple mind.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C4V13">&nbsp;</a>He, being made perfect in a short time, fulfilled a long time:
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C4V14">&nbsp;</a>For his soul pleased the Lord: therefore hasted he to take him away from among the wicked.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C4V15">&nbsp;</a>This the people saw, and understood it not, neither laid they up this in their minds, That his grace
and mercy is with his saints, and that he hath respect unto his chosen.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C4V16">&nbsp;</a>Thus the righteous that is dead shall condemn the ungodly which are living; and youth that is soon perfected
the many years and old age of the unrighteous.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C4V17">&nbsp;</a>For they shall see the end of the wise, and shall not understand what God in his counsel hath decreed
of him, and to what end the Lord hath set him in safety.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C4V18">&nbsp;</a>They shall see him, and despise him; but God shall laugh them to scorn: and they shall hereafter be a
vile carcase, and a reproach among the dead for evermore.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C4V19">&nbsp;</a>For he shall rend them, and cast them down headlong, that they shall be speechless; and he shall shake
them from the foundation; and they shall be utterly laid waste, and be in sorrow; and their memorial
shall perish.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C4V20">&nbsp;</a>And when they cast up the accounts of their sins, they shall come with fear: and their own iniquities
shall convince them to their face.
