 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C7V1">&nbsp;</a>Likewise this
<span class="add">is</span> the law of the trespass offering: it
<span class="add">is</span> most holy.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C7V2">&nbsp;</a>In the place where they kill the burnt offering shall they kill the trespass offering: and the blood
thereof shall he sprinkle round about upon the altar.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C7V3">&nbsp;</a>And he shall offer of it all the fat thereof; the rump, and the fat that covereth the inwards,
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C7V4">&nbsp;</a>And the two kidneys, and the fat that
<span class="add">is</span> on them, which
<span class="add">is</span> by the flanks, and the caul
<span class="add">that is</span> above the liver, with the kidneys, it shall he take away:
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C7V5">&nbsp;</a>And the priest shall burn them upon the altar
<span class="add">for</span> an offering made by fire unto the LORD: it
<span class="add">is</span> a trespass offering.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C7V6">&nbsp;</a>Every male among the priests shall eat thereof: it shall be eaten in the holy place: it
<span class="add">is</span> most holy.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C7V7">&nbsp;</a>As the sin offering
<span class="add">is,</span> so
<span class="add">is</span> the trespass offering:
<span class="add">there is</span> one law for them: the priest that maketh atonement therewith shall have
<span class="add">it.
</span> <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C7V8">&nbsp;</a>And the priest that offereth any man’s burnt offering,
<span class="add">even
</span> the priest shall have to himself the skin of the burnt offering which he hath offered.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C7V9">&nbsp;</a>And all the meat offering that is baken in the oven, and all that is dressed in the fryingpan, and in
the pan, shall be the priest’s that offereth it.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C7V10">&nbsp;</a>And every meat offering, mingled with oil, and dry, shall all the sons of Aaron have, one
<span class="add">as much</span> as another.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C7V11">&nbsp;</a>And this
<span class="add">is</span> the law of the sacrifice of peace offerings, which he shall offer unto the LORD.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C7V12">&nbsp;</a>If he offer it for a thanksgiving, then he shall offer with the sacrifice of thanksgiving unleavened
cakes mingled with oil, and unleavened wafers anointed with oil, and cakes mingled with oil, of fine
flour, fried.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C7V13">&nbsp;</a>Besides the cakes, he shall offer
<span class="add">for</span> his offering leavened bread with the sacrifice of thanksgiving of his peace offerings.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C7V14">&nbsp;</a>And of it he shall offer one out of the whole oblation
<span class="add">for
</span> an heave offering unto the LORD,
<span class="add">and</span> it shall be the priest’s that sprinkleth the blood of the peace offerings.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C7V15">&nbsp;</a>And the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace offerings for thanksgiving shall be eaten the same day that
it is offered; he shall not leave any of it until the morning.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C7V16">&nbsp;</a>But if the sacrifice of his offering
<span class="add">be</span> a vow, or a voluntary offering, it shall be eaten the same day that he offereth his sacrifice: and on
the morrow also the remainder of it shall be eaten:
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C7V17">&nbsp;</a>But the remainder of the flesh of the sacrifice on the third day shall be burnt with fire.
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C7V18">&nbsp;</a>And if
<span class="add">any</span> of the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace offerings be eaten at all on the third day, it shall not
be accepted, neither shall it be imputed unto him that offereth it: it shall be an abomination, and the
soul that eateth of it shall bear his iniquity.
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C7V19">&nbsp;</a>And the flesh that toucheth any unclean
<span class="add">thing</span> shall not be eaten; it shall be burnt with fire: and as for the flesh, all that be clean shall eat thereof.
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C7V20">&nbsp;</a>But the soul that eateth
<span class="add">of</span> the flesh of the sacrifice of peace offerings, that
<span class="add">pertain</span> unto the LORD, having his uncleanness upon him, even that soul shall be cut off from his people.
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C7V21">&nbsp;</a>Moreover the soul that shall touch any unclean
<span class="add">thing, as
</span> the uncleanness of man, or
<span class="add">any</span> unclean beast, or any abominable unclean
<span class="add">thing,</span> and eat of the flesh of the sacrifice of peace offerings, which
<span class="add">pertain</span> unto the LORD, even that soul shall be cut off from his people.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C7V22">&nbsp;</a>And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C7V23">&nbsp;</a>Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, Ye shall eat no manner of fat, of ox, or of sheep, or of goat.
 <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C7V24">&nbsp;</a>And the fat of the beast that dieth of itself, and the fat of that which is torn with beasts, may be
used in any other use: but ye shall in no wise eat of it.
 <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C7V25">&nbsp;</a>For whosoever eateth the fat of the beast, of which men offer an offering made by fire unto the LORD,
even the soul that eateth
<span class="add">it
</span> shall be cut off from his people.
 <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C7V26">&nbsp;</a>Moreover ye shall eat no manner of blood,
<span class="add">whether it be</span> of fowl or of beast, in any of your dwellings.
 <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C7V27">&nbsp;</a>Whatsoever soul
<span class="add">it be</span> that eateth any manner of blood, even that soul shall be cut off from his people.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C7V28">&nbsp;</a>And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,
 <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C7V29">&nbsp;</a>Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, He that offereth the sacrifice of his peace offerings unto
the LORD shall bring his oblation unto the LORD of the sacrifice of his peace offerings.
 <span class="verse"> 30</span><a name="C7V30">&nbsp;</a>His own hands shall bring the offerings of the LORD made by fire, the fat with the breast, it shall he
bring, that the breast may be waved
<span class="add">for</span> a wave offering before the LORD.
 <span class="verse"> 31</span><a name="C7V31">&nbsp;</a>And the priest shall burn the fat upon the altar: but the breast shall be Aaron’s and his sons’.
 <span class="verse"> 32</span><a name="C7V32">&nbsp;</a>And the right shoulder shall ye give unto the priest
<span class="add">for
</span> an heave offering of the sacrifices of your peace offerings.
 <span class="verse"> 33</span><a name="C7V33">&nbsp;</a>He among the sons of Aaron, that offereth the blood of the peace offerings, and the fat, shall have the
right shoulder for
<span class="add">his</span> part.
 <span class="verse"> 34</span><a name="C7V34">&nbsp;</a>For the wave breast and the heave shoulder have I taken of the children of Israel from off the sacrifices
of their peace offerings, and have given them unto Aaron the priest and unto his sons by a statute for
ever from among the children of Israel.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 35</span><a name="C7V35">&nbsp;</a>This
<span class="add">is the portion</span> of the anointing of Aaron, and of the anointing of his sons, out of the offerings of the LORD made by
fire, in the day
<span class="add">when</span> he presented them to minister unto the LORD in the priest’s office;
 <span class="verse"> 36</span><a name="C7V36">&nbsp;</a>Which the LORD commanded to be given them of the children of Israel, in the day that he anointed them,
<span class="add">by</span> a statute for ever throughout their generations.
 <span class="verse"> 37</span><a name="C7V37">&nbsp;</a>This
<span class="add">is</span> the law of the burnt offering, of the meat offering, and of the sin offering, and of the trespass offering,
and of the consecrations, and of the sacrifice of the peace offerings;
 <span class="verse"> 38</span><a name="C7V38">&nbsp;</a>Which the LORD commanded Moses in mount Sinai, in the day that he commanded the children of Israel to
offer their oblations unto the LORD, in the wilderness of Sinai.
