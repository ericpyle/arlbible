 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C2V1">&nbsp;</a>I will stand upon my watch, and set me upon the tower, and will watch to see what he will say unto me,
and what I shall answer when I am reproved.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C2V2">&nbsp;</a>And the LORD answered me, and said, Write the vision, and make
<span class="add">it</span> plain upon tables, that he may run that readeth it.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C2V3">&nbsp;</a>For the vision
<span class="add">is</span> yet for an appointed time, but at the end it shall speak, and not lie: though it tarry, wait for it;
because it will surely come, it will not tarry.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C2V4">&nbsp;</a>Behold, his soul
<span class="add">which</span> is lifted up is not upright in him: but the just shall live by his faith.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C2V5">&nbsp;</a>Yea also, because he transgresseth by wine,
<span class="add">he is</span> a proud man, neither keepeth at home, who enlargeth his desire as hell, and
<span class="add">is
</span> as death, and cannot be satisfied, but gathereth unto him all nations, and heapeth unto him all people:
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C2V6">&nbsp;</a>Shall not all these take up a parable against him, and a taunting proverb against him, and say, Woe to
him that increaseth
<span class="add">that which is
</span> not his! how long? and to him that ladeth himself with thick clay!
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C2V7">&nbsp;</a>Shall they not rise up suddenly that shall bite thee, and awake that shall vex thee, and thou shalt be
for booties unto them?
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C2V8">&nbsp;</a>Because thou hast spoiled many nations, all the remnant of the people shall spoil thee; because of men’s
blood, and
<span class="add">for</span> the violence of the land, of the city, and of all that dwell therein.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C2V9">&nbsp;</a>Woe to him that coveteth an evil covetousness to his house, that he may set his nest on high, that he
may be delivered from the power of evil!
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C2V10">&nbsp;</a>Thou hast consulted shame to thy house by cutting off many people, and hast sinned
<span class="add">against</span> thy soul.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C2V11">&nbsp;</a>For the stone shall cry out of the wall, and the beam out of the timber shall answer it.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C2V12">&nbsp;</a>Woe to him that buildeth a town with blood, and stablisheth a city by iniquity!
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C2V13">&nbsp;</a>Behold,
<span class="add">is it</span> not of the LORD of hosts that the people shall labour in the very fire, and the people shall weary themselves
for very vanity?
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C2V14">&nbsp;</a>For the earth shall be filled with the knowledge of the glory of the LORD, as the waters cover the sea.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C2V15">&nbsp;</a>Woe unto him that giveth his neighbour drink, that puttest thy bottle to
<span class="add">him,</span> and makest
<span class="add">him</span> drunken also, that thou mayest look on their nakedness!
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C2V16">&nbsp;</a>Thou art filled with shame for glory: drink thou also, and let thy foreskin be uncovered: the cup of
the LORD’S right hand shall be turned unto thee, and shameful spewing
<span class="add">shall be</span> on thy glory.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C2V17">&nbsp;</a>For the violence of Lebanon shall cover thee, and the spoil of beasts,
<span class="add">which</span> made them afraid, because of men’s blood, and for the violence of the land, of the city, and of all
that dwell therein.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C2V18">&nbsp;</a>What profiteth the graven image that the maker thereof hath graven it; the molten image, and a teacher
of lies, that the maker of his work trusteth therein, to make dumb idols?
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C2V19">&nbsp;</a>Woe unto him that saith to the wood, Awake; to the dumb stone, Arise, it shall teach! Behold, it
<span class="add">is</span> laid over with gold and silver, and
<span class="add">there is</span> no breath at all in the midst of it.
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C2V20">&nbsp;</a>But the LORD
<span class="add">is</span> in his holy temple: let all the earth keep silence before him.
