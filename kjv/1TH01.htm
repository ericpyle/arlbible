 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C1V1">&nbsp;</a>Paul, and Silvanus, and Timotheus, unto the church of the Thessalonians
<span class="add">which is</span> in God the Father and
<span class="add">in</span> the Lord Jesus Christ: Grace
<span class="add">be</span> unto you, and peace, from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C1V2">&nbsp;</a>We give thanks to God always for you all, making mention of you in our prayers;
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C1V3">&nbsp;</a>Remembering without ceasing your work of faith, and labour of love, and patience of hope in our Lord
Jesus Christ, in the sight of God and our Father;
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C1V4">&nbsp;</a>Knowing, brethren beloved, your election of God.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C1V5">&nbsp;</a>For our gospel came not unto you in word only, but also in power, and in the Holy Ghost, and in much
assurance; as ye know what manner of men we were among you for your sake.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C1V6">&nbsp;</a>And ye became followers of us, and of the Lord, having received the word in much affliction, with joy
of the Holy Ghost:
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C1V7">&nbsp;</a>So that ye were ensamples to all that believe in Macedonia and Achaia.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C1V8">&nbsp;</a>For from you sounded out the word of the Lord not only in Macedonia and Achaia, but also in every place
your faith to God-ward is spread abroad; so that we need not to speak any thing.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C1V9">&nbsp;</a>For they themselves shew of us what manner of entering in we had unto you, and how ye turned to God from
idols to serve the living and true God;
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C1V10">&nbsp;</a>And to wait for his Son from heaven, whom he raised from the dead,
<span class="add">even</span> Jesus, which delivered us from the wrath to come.
