 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C30V1">&nbsp;</a>And it came to pass, when David and his men were come to Ziklag on the third day, that the Amalekites
had invaded the south, and Ziklag, and smitten Ziklag, and burned it with fire;
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C30V2">&nbsp;</a>And had taken the women captives, that
<span class="add">were</span> therein: they slew not any, either great or small, but carried
<span class="add">them</span> away, and went on their way.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C30V3">&nbsp;</a>So David and his men came to the city, and, behold, it was burned with fire; and their wives, and their
sons, and their daughters, were taken captives.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C30V4">&nbsp;</a>Then David and the people that
<span class="add">were</span> with him lifted up their voice and wept, until they had no more power to weep.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C30V5">&nbsp;</a>And David’s two wives were taken captives, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail the wife of Nabal the
Carmelite.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C30V6">&nbsp;</a>And David was greatly distressed; for the people spake of stoning him, because the soul of all the people
was grieved, every man for his sons and for his daughters: but David encouraged himself in the LORD his
God.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C30V7">&nbsp;</a>And David said to Abiathar the priest, Ahimelech’s son, I pray thee, bring me hither the ephod. And Abiathar
brought thither the ephod to David.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C30V8">&nbsp;</a>And David enquired at the LORD, saying, Shall I pursue after this troop? shall I overtake them? And he
answered him, Pursue: for thou shalt surely overtake
<span class="add">them,</span> and without fail recover
<span class="add">all.
</span> <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C30V9">&nbsp;</a>So David went, he and the six hundred men that
<span class="add">were</span> with him, and came to the brook Besor, where those that were left behind stayed.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C30V10">&nbsp;</a>But David pursued, he and four hundred men: for two hundred abode behind, which were so faint that they
could not go over the brook Besor.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C30V11">&nbsp;</a>And they found an Egyptian in the field, and brought him to David, and gave him bread, and he did eat;
and they made him drink water;
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C30V12">&nbsp;</a>And they gave him a piece of a cake of figs, and two clusters of raisins: and when he had eaten, his
spirit came again to him: for he had eaten no bread, nor drunk
<span class="add">any</span> water, three days and three nights.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C30V13">&nbsp;</a>And David said unto him, To whom
<span class="add">belongest</span> thou? and whence art thou? And he said, I
<span class="add">am</span> a young man of Egypt, servant to an Amalekite; and my master left me, because three days agone I fell
sick.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C30V14">&nbsp;</a>We made an invasion
<span class="add">upon</span> the south of the Cherethites, and upon
<span class="add">the coast</span> which
<span class="add">belongeth</span> to Judah, and upon the south of Caleb; and we burned Ziklag with fire.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C30V15">&nbsp;</a>And David said to him, Canst thou bring me down to this company? And he said, Swear unto me by God, that
thou wilt neither kill me, nor deliver me into the hands of my master, and I will bring thee down to
this company.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C30V16">&nbsp;</a>And when he had brought him down, behold,
<span class="add">they were</span> spread abroad upon all the earth, eating and drinking, and dancing, because of all the great spoil that
they had taken out of the land of the Philistines, and out of the land of Judah.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C30V17">&nbsp;</a>And David smote them from the twilight even unto the evening of the next day: and there escaped not a
man of them, save four hundred young men, which rode upon camels, and fled.
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C30V18">&nbsp;</a>And David recovered all that the Amalekites had carried away: and David rescued his two wives.
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C30V19">&nbsp;</a>And there was nothing lacking to them, neither small nor great, neither sons nor daughters, neither spoil,
nor any
<span class="add">thing</span> that they had taken to them: David recovered all.
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C30V20">&nbsp;</a>And David took all the flocks and the herds,
<span class="add">which</span> they drave before those
<span class="add">other</span> cattle, and said, This
<span class="add">is</span> David’s spoil.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C30V21">&nbsp;</a>And David came to the two hundred men, which were so faint that they could not follow David, whom they
had made also to abide at the brook Besor: and they went forth to meet David, and to meet the people
that
<span class="add">were
</span> with him: and when David came near to the people, he saluted them.
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C30V22">&nbsp;</a>Then answered all the wicked men and
<span class="add">men</span> of Belial, of those that went with David, and said, Because they went not with us, we will not give
them
<span class="add">ought</span> of the spoil that we have recovered, save to every man his wife and his children, that they may lead
<span class="add">them</span> away, and depart.
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C30V23">&nbsp;</a>Then said David, Ye shall not do so, my brethren, with that which the LORD hath given us, who hath preserved
us, and delivered the company that came against us into our hand.
 <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C30V24">&nbsp;</a>For who will hearken unto you in this matter? but as his part
<span class="add">is</span> that goeth down to the battle, so
<span class="add">shall</span> his part
<span class="add">be</span> that tarrieth by the stuff: they shall part alike.
 <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C30V25">&nbsp;</a>And it was
<span class="add">so</span> from that day forward, that he made it a statute and an ordinance for Israel unto this day.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C30V26">&nbsp;</a>And when David came to Ziklag, he sent of the spoil unto the elders of Judah,
<span class="add">even</span> to his friends, saying, Behold a present for you of the spoil of the enemies of the LORD;
 <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C30V27">&nbsp;</a>To
<span class="add">them</span> which
<span class="add">were</span> in Bethel, and to
<span class="add">them
</span> which
<span class="add">were</span> in south Ramoth, and to
<span class="add">them</span> which
<span class="add">were</span> in Jattir,
 <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C30V28">&nbsp;</a>And to
<span class="add">them</span> which
<span class="add">were</span> in Aroer, and to
<span class="add">them
</span> which
<span class="add">were</span> in Siphmoth, and to
<span class="add">them</span> which
<span class="add">were</span> in Eshtemoa,
 <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C30V29">&nbsp;</a>And to
<span class="add">them</span> which
<span class="add">were</span> in Rachal, and to
<span class="add">them
</span> which
<span class="add">were</span> in the cities of the Jerahmeelites, and to
<span class="add">them</span> which
<span class="add">were</span> in the cities of the Kenites,
 <span class="verse"> 30</span><a name="C30V30">&nbsp;</a>And to
<span class="add">them</span> which
<span class="add">were</span> in Hormah, and to
<span class="add">them
</span> which
<span class="add">were</span> in Chor-ashan, and to
<span class="add">them</span> which
<span class="add">were</span> in Athach,
 <span class="verse"> 31</span><a name="C30V31">&nbsp;</a>And to
<span class="add">them</span> which
<span class="add">were</span> in Hebron, and to all the places where David himself and his men were wont to haunt.
