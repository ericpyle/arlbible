 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C22V1">&nbsp;</a>Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C22V2">&nbsp;</a>Now, thou son of man, wilt thou judge, wilt thou judge the bloody city? yea, thou shalt shew her all
her abominations.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C22V3">&nbsp;</a>Then say thou, Thus saith the Lord GOD, The city sheddeth blood in the midst of it, that her time may
come, and maketh idols against herself to defile herself.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C22V4">&nbsp;</a>Thou art become guilty in thy blood that thou hast shed; and hast defiled thyself in thine idols which
thou hast made; and thou hast caused thy days to draw near, and art come
<span class="add">even</span> unto thy years: therefore have I made thee a reproach unto the heathen, and a mocking to all countries.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C22V5">&nbsp;</a><span class="add">Those that be</span> near, and
<span class="add">those that be</span> far from thee, shall mock thee,
<span class="add">which art</span> infamous
<span class="add">and</span> much vexed.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C22V6">&nbsp;</a>Behold, the princes of Israel, every one were in thee to their power to shed blood.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C22V7">&nbsp;</a>In thee have they set light by father and mother: in the midst of thee have they dealt by oppression
with the stranger: in thee have they vexed the fatherless and the widow.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C22V8">&nbsp;</a>Thou hast despised mine holy things, and hast profaned my sabbaths.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C22V9">&nbsp;</a>In thee are men that carry tales to shed blood: and in thee they eat upon the mountains: in the midst
of thee they commit lewdness.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C22V10">&nbsp;</a>In thee have they discovered their fathers’ nakedness: in thee have they humbled her that was set apart
for pollution.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C22V11">&nbsp;</a>And one hath committed abomination with his neighbour’s wife; and another hath lewdly defiled his daughter
in law; and another in thee hath humbled his sister, his father’s daughter.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C22V12">&nbsp;</a>In thee have they taken gifts to shed blood; thou hast taken usury and increase, and thou hast greedily
gained of thy neighbours by extortion, and hast forgotten me, saith the Lord GOD.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C22V13">&nbsp;</a>Behold, therefore I have smitten mine hand at thy dishonest gain which thou hast made, and at thy blood
which hath been in the midst of thee.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C22V14">&nbsp;</a>Can thine heart endure, or can thine hands be strong, in the days that I shall deal with thee? I the
LORD have spoken
<span class="add">it,</span> and will do
<span class="add">it.
</span> <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C22V15">&nbsp;</a>And I will scatter thee among the heathen, and disperse thee in the countries, and will consume thy filthiness
out of thee.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C22V16">&nbsp;</a>And thou shalt take thine inheritance in thyself in the sight of the heathen, and thou shalt know that
I
<span class="add">am</span> the LORD.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C22V17">&nbsp;</a>And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C22V18">&nbsp;</a>Son of man, the house of Israel is to me become dross: all they
<span class="add">are</span> brass, and tin, and iron, and lead, in the midst of the furnace; they are
<span class="add">even</span> the dross of silver.
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C22V19">&nbsp;</a>Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Because ye are all become dross, behold, therefore I will gather you
into the midst of Jerusalem.
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C22V20">&nbsp;</a><span class="add">As</span> they gather silver, and brass, and iron, and lead, and tin, into the midst of the furnace, to blow the
fire upon it, to melt
<span class="add">it;</span> so will I gather
<span class="add">you</span> in mine anger and in my fury, and I will leave
<span class="add">you there,</span> and melt you.
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C22V21">&nbsp;</a>Yea, I will gather you, and blow upon you in the fire of my wrath, and ye shall be melted in the midst
thereof.
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C22V22">&nbsp;</a>As silver is melted in the midst of the furnace, so shall ye be melted in the midst thereof; and ye shall
know that I the LORD have poured out my fury upon you.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C22V23">&nbsp;</a>And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,
 <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C22V24">&nbsp;</a>Son of man, say unto her, Thou
<span class="add">art</span> the land that is not cleansed, nor rained upon in the day of indignation.
 <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C22V25">&nbsp;</a><span class="add">There is</span> a conspiracy of her prophets in the midst thereof, like a roaring lion ravening the prey; they have
devoured souls; they have taken the treasure and precious things; they have made her many widows in the
midst thereof.
 <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C22V26">&nbsp;</a>Her priests have violated my law, and have profaned mine holy things: they have put no difference between
the holy and profane, neither have they shewed
<span class="add">difference</span> between the unclean and the clean, and have hid their eyes from my sabbaths, and I am profaned among
them.
 <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C22V27">&nbsp;</a>Her princes in the midst thereof
<span class="add">are</span> like wolves ravening the prey, to shed blood,
<span class="add">and</span> to destroy souls, to get dishonest gain.
 <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C22V28">&nbsp;</a>And her prophets have daubed them with untempered
<span class="add">morter,</span> seeing vanity, and divining lies unto them, saying, Thus saith the Lord GOD, when the LORD hath not
spoken.
 <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C22V29">&nbsp;</a>The people of the land have used oppression, and exercised robbery, and have vexed the poor and needy:
yea, they have oppressed the stranger wrongfully.
 <span class="verse"> 30</span><a name="C22V30">&nbsp;</a>And I sought for a man among them, that should make up the hedge, and stand in the gap before me for
the land, that I should not destroy it: but I found none.
 <span class="verse"> 31</span><a name="C22V31">&nbsp;</a>Therefore have I poured out mine indignation upon them; I have consumed them with the fire of my wrath:
their own way have I recompensed upon their heads, saith the Lord GOD.
