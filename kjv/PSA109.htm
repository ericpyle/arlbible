 <span class="verse" id="V1">1&nbsp;</span>Hold not thy peace, O God of my praise; </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span>For the mouth of the wicked and the mouth of the deceitful are opened against me: they have spoken against me with a lying tongue. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>They compassed me about also with words of hatred; and fought against me without a cause. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>For my love they are my adversaries: but I <span class='add'>give myself unto</span> prayer. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>And they have rewarded me evil for good, and hatred for my love. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>Set thou a wicked man over him: and let Satan stand at his right hand. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>When he shall be judged, let him be condemned: and let his prayer become sin. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>Let his days be few; <span class='add'>and</span> let another take his office. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>Let his children be fatherless, and his wife a widow. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>Let his children be continually vagabonds, and beg: let them seek <span class='add'>their bread</span> also out of their desolate places. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>Let the extortioner catch all that he hath; and let the strangers spoil his labour. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>Let there be none to extend mercy unto him: neither let there be any to favour his fatherless children. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>Let his posterity be cut off; <span class='add'>and</span> in the generation following let their name be blotted out. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>Let the iniquity of his fathers be remembered with the LORD; and let not the sin of his mother be blotted out. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>Let them be before the LORD continually, that he may cut off the memory of them from the earth. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>Because that he remembered not to shew mercy, but persecuted the poor and needy man, that he might even slay the broken in heart. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>As he loved cursing, so let it come unto him: as he delighted not in blessing, so let it be far from him. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>As he clothed himself with cursing like as with his garment, so let it come into his bowels like water, and like oil into his bones. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>Let it be unto him as the garment <span class='add'>which</span> covereth him, and for a girdle wherewith he is girded continually. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span> <span class='add'>Let</span> this <span class='add'>be</span> the reward of mine adversaries from the LORD, and of them that speak evil against my soul. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>But do thou for me, O GOD the Lord, for thy name’s sake: because thy mercy <span class='add'>is</span> good, deliver thou me. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>For I <span class='add'>am</span> poor and needy, and my heart is wounded within me. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>I am gone like the shadow when it declineth: I am tossed up and down as the locust. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>My knees are weak through fasting; and my flesh faileth of fatness. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>I became also a reproach unto them: <span class='add'>when</span> they looked upon me they shaked their heads. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>Help me, O LORD my God: O save me according to thy mercy: </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>That they may know that this <span class='add'>is</span> thy hand; <span class='add'>that</span> thou, LORD, hast done it. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V28">28&nbsp;</span>Let them curse, but bless thou: when they arise, let them be ashamed; but let thy servant rejoice. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V29">29&nbsp;</span>Let mine adversaries be clothed with shame, and let them cover themselves with their own confusion, as with a mantle. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V30">30&nbsp;</span>I will greatly praise the LORD with my mouth; yea, I will praise him among the multitude. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V31">31&nbsp;</span>For he shall stand at the right hand of the poor, to save <span class='add'>him</span> from those that condemn his soul. </div><ul class='tnav'>
