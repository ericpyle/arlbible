 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C28V1">&nbsp;</a>In the end of the sabbath, as it began to dawn toward the first
<span class="add">day</span> of the week, came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary to see the sepulchre.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C28V2">&nbsp;</a>And, behold, there was a great earthquake: for the angel of the Lord descended from heaven, and came
and rolled back the stone from the door, and sat upon it.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C28V3">&nbsp;</a>His countenance was like lightning, and his raiment white as snow:
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C28V4">&nbsp;</a>And for fear of him the keepers did shake, and became as dead
<span class="add">men.
</span> <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C28V5">&nbsp;</a>And the angel answered and said unto the women, Fear not ye: for I know that ye seek Jesus, which was
crucified.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C28V6">&nbsp;</a>He is not here: for he is risen, as he said. Come, see the place where the Lord lay.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C28V7">&nbsp;</a>And go quickly, and tell his disciples that he is risen from the dead; and, behold, he goeth before you
into Galilee; there shall ye see him: lo, I have told you.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C28V8">&nbsp;</a>And they departed quickly from the sepulchre with fear and great joy; and did run to bring his disciples
word.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C28V9">&nbsp;</a>And as they went to tell his disciples, behold, Jesus met them, saying,
<span class="wj">All hail.</span> And they came and held him by the feet, and worshipped him.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C28V10">&nbsp;</a>Then said Jesus unto them,
<span class="wj">Be not afraid: go tell my brethren that they go into Galilee, and there shall they see me.</span></div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C28V11">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Now when they were going, behold, some of the watch came into the city, and shewed unto the chief priests
all the things that were done.
</span> <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C28V12">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And when they were assembled with the elders, and had taken counsel, they gave large money unto the soldiers,
</span> <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C28V13">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Saying, Say ye, His disciples came by night, and stole him
</span><span class="add">away</span><span class="wj"> while we slept.
</span> <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C28V14">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And if this come to the governor’s ears, we will persuade him, and secure you.
</span> <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C28V15">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">So they took the money, and did as they were taught: and this saying is commonly reported among the Jews
until this day.</span></div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C28V16">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Then the eleven disciples went away into Galilee, into a mountain where Jesus had appointed them.
</span> <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C28V17">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And when they saw him, they worshipped him: but some doubted.
</span> <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C28V18">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And Jesus came and spake unto them, saying, All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth.
</span> <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C28V19">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and
of the Holy Ghost:
</span> <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C28V20">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and, lo, I am with you alway,
</span><span class="add">even</span><span class="wj"> unto the end of the world. Amen.</span></div>
