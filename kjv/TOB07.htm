<div class="chapterlabel"> 7</div><div class="p">
 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C7V1">&nbsp;</a>And when they were come to Ecbatane, they came to the house of Raguel, and Sara met them: and after they
had saluted one another, she brought them into the house.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C7V2">&nbsp;</a>Then said Raguel to Edna his wife, How like is this young man to Tobit my cousin!
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C7V3">&nbsp;</a>And Raguel asked them, From whence are ye, brethren? To whom they said, We are of the sons of Nephthalim,
which are captives in Nineve.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C7V4">&nbsp;</a>Then he said to them, Do ye know Tobit our kinsman? And they said, We know him. Then said he, Is he in
good health?
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C7V5">&nbsp;</a>And they said, He is both alive, and in good health: and Tobias said, He is my father.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C7V6">&nbsp;</a>Then Raguel leaped up, and kissed him, and wept,
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C7V7">&nbsp;</a>And blessed him, and said unto him, Thou art the son of an honest and good man. But when he had heard
that Tobit was blind, he was sorrowful, and wept.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C7V8">&nbsp;</a>And likewise Edna his wife and Sara his daughter wept. Moreover they entertained them cheerfully; and
after that they had killed a ram of the flock, they set store of meat on the table. Then said Tobias
to Raphael, Brother Azarias, speak of those things of which thou didst talk in the way, and let this
business be dispatched.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C7V9">&nbsp;</a>So he communicated the matter with Raguel: and Raguel said to Tobias, Eat and drink, and make merry:
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C7V10">&nbsp;</a>For it is meet that thou shouldest marry my daughter: nevertheless I will declare unto thee the truth.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C7V11">&nbsp;</a>I have given my daughter in marriage to seven men, who died that night they came in unto her: nevertheless
for the present be merry. But Tobias said, I will eat nothing here, till we agree and swear one to another.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C7V12">&nbsp;</a>Raguel said, Then take her from henceforth according to the manner, for thou art her cousin, and she
is thine, and the merciful God give you good success in all things.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C7V13">&nbsp;</a>Then he called his daughter Sara, and she came to her father, and he took her by the hand, and gave her
to be wife to Tobias, saying, Behold, take her after the law of Moses, and lead her away to thy father.
And he blessed them;
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C7V14">&nbsp;</a>And called Edna his wife, and took paper, and did write an instrument of covenants, and sealed it.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C7V15">&nbsp;</a>Then they began to eat.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C7V16">&nbsp;</a>After Raguel called his wife Edna, and said unto her, Sister, prepare another chamber, and bring her
in thither.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C7V17">&nbsp;</a>Which when she had done as he had bidden her, she brought her thither: and she wept, and she received
the tears of her daughter, and said unto her,
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C7V18">&nbsp;</a>Be of good comfort, my daughter; the Lord of heaven and earth give thee joy for this thy sorrow: be of
good comfort, my daughter.
