 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C11V1">&nbsp;</a>Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C11V2">&nbsp;</a>For by it the elders obtained a good report.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C11V3">&nbsp;</a>Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God, so that things which are
seen were not made of things which do appear.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C11V4">&nbsp;</a>By faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain, by which he obtained witness that
he was righteous, God testifying of his gifts: and by it he being dead yet speaketh.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C11V5">&nbsp;</a>By faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death; and was not found, because God had translated
him: for before his translation he had this testimony, that he pleased God.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C11V6">&nbsp;</a>But without faith
<span class="add">it is</span> impossible to please
<span class="add">him:
</span> for he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and
<span class="add">that
</span> he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C11V7">&nbsp;</a>By faith Noah, being warned of God of things not seen as yet, moved with fear, prepared an ark to the
saving of his house; by the which he condemned the world, and became heir of the righteousness which
is by faith.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C11V8">&nbsp;</a>By faith Abraham, when he was called to go out into a place which he should after receive for an inheritance,
obeyed; and he went out, not knowing whither he went.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C11V9">&nbsp;</a>By faith he sojourned in the land of promise, as
<span class="add">in</span> a strange country, dwelling in tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob, the heirs with him of the same promise:
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C11V10">&nbsp;</a>For he looked for a city which hath foundations, whose builder and maker
<span class="add">is</span> God.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C11V11">&nbsp;</a>Through faith also Sara herself received strength to conceive seed, and was delivered of a child when
she was past age, because she judged him faithful who had promised.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C11V12">&nbsp;</a>Therefore sprang there even of one, and him as good as dead,
<span class="add">so many</span> as the stars of the sky in multitude, and as the sand which is by the sea shore innumerable.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C11V13">&nbsp;</a>These all died in faith, not having received the promises, but having seen them afar off, and were persuaded
of
<span class="add">them,</span> and embraced
<span class="add">them,</span> and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C11V14">&nbsp;</a>For they that say such things declare plainly that they seek a country.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C11V15">&nbsp;</a>And truly, if they had been mindful of that
<span class="add">country</span> from whence they came out, they might have had opportunity to have returned.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C11V16">&nbsp;</a>But now they desire a better
<span class="add">country,</span> that is, an heavenly: wherefore God is not ashamed to be called their God: for he hath prepared for
them a city.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C11V17">&nbsp;</a>By faith Abraham, when he was tried, offered up Isaac: and he that had received the promises offered
up his only begotten
<span class="add">son,
</span> <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C11V18">&nbsp;</a>Of whom it was said, That in Isaac shall thy seed be called:
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C11V19">&nbsp;</a>Accounting that God
<span class="add">was</span> able to raise
<span class="add">him</span> up, even from the dead; from whence also he received him in a figure.
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C11V20">&nbsp;</a>By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau concerning things to come.
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C11V21">&nbsp;</a>By faith Jacob, when he was a dying, blessed both the sons of Joseph; and worshipped,
<span class="add">leaning</span> upon the top of his staff.
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C11V22">&nbsp;</a>By faith Joseph, when he died, made mention of the departing of the children of Israel; and gave commandment
concerning his bones.
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C11V23">&nbsp;</a>By faith Moses, when he was born, was hid three months of his parents, because they saw
<span class="add">he was</span> a proper child; and they were not afraid of the king’s commandment.
 <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C11V24">&nbsp;</a>By faith Moses, when he was come to years, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh’s daughter;
 <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C11V25">&nbsp;</a>Choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of God, than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a
season;
 <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C11V26">&nbsp;</a>Esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures in Egypt: for he had respect unto
the recompence of the reward.
 <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C11V27">&nbsp;</a>By faith he forsook Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king: for he endured, as seeing him who is invisible.
 <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C11V28">&nbsp;</a>Through faith he kept the passover, and the sprinkling of blood, lest he that destroyed the firstborn
should touch them.
 <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C11V29">&nbsp;</a>By faith they passed through the Red sea as by dry
<span class="add">land:
</span> which the Egyptians assaying to do were drowned.
 <span class="verse"> 30</span><a name="C11V30">&nbsp;</a>By faith the walls of Jericho fell down, after they were compassed about seven days.
 <span class="verse"> 31</span><a name="C11V31">&nbsp;</a>By faith the harlot Rahab perished not with them that believed not, when she had received the spies with
peace.
 <span class="verse"> 32</span><a name="C11V32">&nbsp;</a>And what shall I more say? for the time would fail me to tell of Gedeon, and
<span class="add">of</span> Barak, and
<span class="add">of</span> Samson, and
<span class="add">of</span> Jephthae;
<span class="add">of</span> David also, and Samuel, and
<span class="add">of</span> the prophets:
 <span class="verse"> 33</span><a name="C11V33">&nbsp;</a>Who through faith subdued kingdoms, wrought righteousness, obtained promises, stopped the mouths of lions,
 <span class="verse"> 34</span><a name="C11V34">&nbsp;</a>Quenched the violence of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, out of weakness were made strong, waxed
valiant in fight, turned to flight the armies of the aliens.
 <span class="verse"> 35</span><a name="C11V35">&nbsp;</a>Women received their dead raised to life again: and others were tortured, not accepting deliverance;
that they might obtain a better resurrection:
 <span class="verse"> 36</span><a name="C11V36">&nbsp;</a>And others had trial of
<span class="add">cruel</span> mockings and scourgings, yea, moreover of bonds and imprisonment:
 <span class="verse"> 37</span><a name="C11V37">&nbsp;</a>They were stoned, they were sawn asunder, were tempted, were slain with the sword: they wandered about
in sheepskins and goatskins; being destitute, afflicted, tormented;
 <span class="verse"> 38</span><a name="C11V38">&nbsp;</a>(Of whom the world was not worthy:) they wandered in deserts, and
<span class="add">in</span> mountains, and
<span class="add">in</span> dens and caves of the earth.
 <span class="verse"> 39</span><a name="C11V39">&nbsp;</a>And these all, having obtained a good report through faith, received not the promise:
 <span class="verse"> 40</span><a name="C11V40">&nbsp;</a>God having provided some better thing for us, that they without us should not be made perfect.
