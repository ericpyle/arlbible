 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C2V1">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Unto the angel of the church of Ephesus write; These things saith he that holdeth the seven stars in
his right hand, who walketh in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks;
</span> <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C2V2">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">I know thy works, and thy labour, and thy patience, and how thou canst not bear them which are evil:
and thou hast tried them which say they are apostles, and are not, and hast found them liars:
</span> <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C2V3">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And hast borne, and hast patience, and for my name’s sake hast laboured, and hast not fainted.
</span> <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C2V4">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Nevertheless I have
</span><span class="add">somewhat</span><span class="wj"> against thee, because thou hast left thy first love.
</span> <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C2V5">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Remember therefore from whence thou art fallen, and repent, and do the first works; or else I will come
unto thee quickly, and will remove thy candlestick out of his place, except thou repent.
</span> <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C2V6">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">But this thou hast, that thou hatest the deeds of the Nicolaitanes, which I also hate.
</span> <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C2V7">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches; To him that overcometh will
I give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the midst of the paradise of God.</span></div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C2V8">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And unto the angel of the church in Smyrna write; These things saith the first and the last, which was
dead, and is alive;
</span> <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C2V9">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">I know thy works, and tribulation, and poverty, (but thou art rich) and
</span><span class="add">I know</span><span class="wj"> the blasphemy of them which say they are Jews, and are not, but
</span><span class="add">are</span><span class="wj"> the synagogue of Satan.
</span> <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C2V10">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Fear none of those things which thou shalt suffer: behold, the devil shall cast
</span><span class="add">some</span><span class="wj"> of you into prison, that ye may be tried; and ye shall have tribulation ten days: be thou faithful unto
death, and I will give thee a crown of life.
</span> <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C2V11">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches; He that overcometh shall not
be hurt of the second death.</span></div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C2V12">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And to the angel of the church in Pergamos write; These things saith he which hath the sharp sword with
two edges;
</span> <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C2V13">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">I know thy works, and where thou dwellest,
</span><span class="add">even</span><span class="wj"> where Satan’s seat
</span><span class="add">is:</span><span class="wj"> and thou holdest fast my name, and hast not denied my faith, even in those days wherein Antipas
</span><span class="add">was
</span><span class="wj"> my faithful martyr, who was slain among you, where Satan dwelleth.
</span> <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C2V14">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">But I have a few things against thee, because thou hast there them that hold the doctrine of Balaam,
who taught Balac to cast a stumblingblock before the children of Israel, to eat things sacrificed unto
idols, and to commit fornication.
</span> <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C2V15">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">So hast thou also them that hold the doctrine of the Nicolaitanes, which thing I hate.
</span> <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C2V16">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Repent; or else I will come unto thee quickly, and will fight against them with the sword of my mouth.
</span> <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C2V17">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches; To him that overcometh will
I give to eat of the hidden manna, and will give him a white stone, and in the stone a new name written,
which no man knoweth saving he that receiveth
</span><span class="add">it.</span></div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C2V18">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And unto the angel of the church in Thyatira write; These things saith the Son of God, who hath his eyes
like unto a flame of fire, and his feet
</span><span class="add">are</span><span class="wj"> like fine brass;
</span> <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C2V19">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">I know thy works, and charity, and service, and faith, and thy patience, and thy works; and the last
</span><span class="add">to be</span><span class="wj"> more than the first.
</span> <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C2V20">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Notwithstanding I have a few things against thee, because thou sufferest that woman Jezebel, which calleth
herself a prophetess, to teach and to seduce my servants to commit fornication, and to eat things sacrificed
unto idols.
</span> <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C2V21">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And I gave her space to repent of her fornication; and she repented not.
</span> <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C2V22">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Behold, I will cast her into a bed, and them that commit adultery with her into great tribulation, except
they repent of their deeds.
</span> <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C2V23">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And I will kill her children with death; and all the churches shall know that I am he which searcheth
the reins and hearts: and I will give unto every one of you according to your works.
</span> <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C2V24">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">But unto you I say, and unto the rest in Thyatira, as many as have not this doctrine, and which have
not known the depths of Satan, as they speak; I will put upon you none other burden.
</span> <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C2V25">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">But that which ye have
</span><span class="add">already</span><span class="wj"> hold fast till I come.
</span> <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C2V26">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And he that overcometh, and keepeth my works unto the end, to him will I give power over the nations:
</span> <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C2V27">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And he shall rule them with a rod of iron; as the vessels of a potter shall they be broken to shivers:
even as I received of my Father.
</span> <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C2V28">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And I will give him the morning star.
</span> <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C2V29">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches.</span></div>
