<div class="chapterlabel"> 12</div><div class="p">
 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C12V1">&nbsp;</a>For thine incorruptible Spirit is in all things.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C12V2">&nbsp;</a>Therefore chastenest thou them by little and little that offend, and warnest them by putting them in
remembrance wherein they have offended, that leaving their wickedness they may believe on thee, O Lord.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C12V3">&nbsp;</a>For it was thy will to destroy by the hands of our fathers both those old inhabitants of thy holy land,
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C12V4">&nbsp;</a>Whom thou hatedst for doing most odious works of witchcrafts, and wicked sacrifices;
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C12V5">&nbsp;</a>And also those merciless murderers of children, and devourers of man’s flesh, and the feasts of blood,
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C12V6">&nbsp;</a>With their priests out of the midst of their idolatrous crew, and the parents, that killed with their
own hands souls destitute of help:
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C12V7">&nbsp;</a>That the land, which thou esteemedst above all other, might receive a worthy colony of God’s children.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C12V8">&nbsp;</a>Nevertheless even those thou sparedst as men, and didst send wasps, forerunners of thine host, to destroy
them by little and little.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C12V9">&nbsp;</a>Not that thou wast unable to bring the ungodly under the hand of the righteous in battle, or to destroy
them at once with cruel beasts, or with one rough word:
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C12V10">&nbsp;</a>But executing thy judgments upon them by little and little, thou gavest them place of repentance, not
being ignorant that they were a naughty generation, and that their malice was bred in them, and that
their cogitation would never be changed.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C12V11">&nbsp;</a>For it was a cursed seed from the beginning; neither didst thou for fear of any man give them pardon
for those things wherein they sinned.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C12V12">&nbsp;</a>For who shall say, What hast thou done? or who shall withstand thy judgment? or who shall accuse thee
for the nations that perish, whom thou made? or who shall come to stand against thee, to be revenged
for the unrighteous men?
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C12V13">&nbsp;</a>For neither is there any God but thou that careth for all, to whom thou mightest shew that thy judgment
is not unright.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C12V14">&nbsp;</a>Neither shall king or tyrant be able to set his face against thee for any whom thou hast punished.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C12V15">&nbsp;</a>Forsomuch then as thou art righteous thyself, thou orderest all things righteously: thinking it not agreeable
with thy power to condemn him that hath not deserved to be punished.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C12V16">&nbsp;</a>For thy power is the beginning of righteousness, and because thou art the Lord of all, it maketh thee
to be gracious unto all.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C12V17">&nbsp;</a>For when men will not believe that thou art of a full power, thou shewest thy strength, and among them
that know it thou makest their boldness manifest.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C12V18">&nbsp;</a>But thou, mastering thy power, judgest with equity, and orderest us with great favour: for thou mayest
use power when thou wilt.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C12V19">&nbsp;</a>But by such works hast thou taught thy people that the just man should be merciful, and hast made thy
children to be of a good hope that thou givest repentance for sins.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C12V20">&nbsp;</a>For if thou didst punish the enemies of thy children, and the condemned to death, with such deliberation,
giving them time and place, whereby they might be delivered from their malice:
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C12V21">&nbsp;</a>With how great circumspection didst thou judge thine own sons, unto whose fathers thou hast sworn, and
made covenants of good promises?
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C12V22">&nbsp;</a>Therefore, whereas thou dost chasten us, thou scourgest our enemies a thousand times more, to the intent
that, when we judge, we should carefully think of thy goodness, and when we ourselves are judged, we
should look for mercy.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C12V23">&nbsp;</a>Wherefore, whereas men have lived dissolutely and unrighteously, thou hast tormented them with their
own abominations.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C12V24">&nbsp;</a>For they went astray very far in the ways of error, and held them for gods, which even among the beasts
of their enemies were despised, being deceived, as children of no understanding.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C12V25">&nbsp;</a>Therefore unto them, as to children without the use of reason, thou didst send a judgment to mock them.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C12V26">&nbsp;</a>But they that would not be reformed by that correction, wherein he dallied with them, shall feel a judgment
worthy of God.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C12V27">&nbsp;</a>For, look, for what things they grudged, when they were punished, that is, for them whom they thought
to be gods;
<span class="add">now</span> being punished in them, when they saw it, they acknowledged him to be the true God, whom before they
denied to know: and therefore came extreme damnation upon them.
