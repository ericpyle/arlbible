 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C2V1">&nbsp;</a>I said in mine heart, Go to now, I will prove thee with mirth, therefore enjoy pleasure: and, behold,
this also
<span class="add">is</span> vanity.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C2V2">&nbsp;</a>I said of laughter,
<span class="add">It is</span> mad: and of mirth, What doeth it?
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C2V3">&nbsp;</a>I sought in mine heart to give myself unto wine, yet acquainting mine heart with wisdom; and to lay hold
on folly, till I might see what
<span class="add">was</span> that good for the sons of men, which they should do under the heaven all the days of their life.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C2V4">&nbsp;</a>I made me great works; I builded me houses; I planted me vineyards:
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C2V5">&nbsp;</a>I made me gardens and orchards, and I planted trees in them of all
<span class="add">kind of</span> fruits:
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C2V6">&nbsp;</a>I made me pools of water, to water therewith the wood that bringeth forth trees:
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C2V7">&nbsp;</a>I got
<span class="add">me</span> servants and maidens, and had servants born in my house; also I had great possessions of great and small
cattle above all that were in Jerusalem before me:
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C2V8">&nbsp;</a>I gathered me also silver and gold, and the peculiar treasure of kings and of the provinces: I gat me
men singers and women singers, and the delights of the sons of men,
<span class="add">as</span> musical instruments, and that of all sorts.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C2V9">&nbsp;</a>So I was great, and increased more than all that were before me in Jerusalem: also my wisdom remained
with me.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C2V10">&nbsp;</a>And whatsoever mine eyes desired I kept not from them, I withheld not my heart from any joy; for my heart
rejoiced in all my labour: and this was my portion of all my labour.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C2V11">&nbsp;</a>Then I looked on all the works that my hands had wrought, and on the labour that I had laboured to do:
and, behold, all
<span class="add">was</span> vanity and vexation of spirit, and
<span class="add">there was</span> no profit under the sun.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C2V12">&nbsp;</a>And I turned myself to behold wisdom, and madness, and folly: for what
<span class="add">can</span> the man
<span class="add">do</span> that cometh after the king?
<span class="add">even</span> that which hath been already done.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C2V13">&nbsp;</a>Then I saw that wisdom excelleth folly, as far as light excelleth darkness.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C2V14">&nbsp;</a>The wise man’s eyes
<span class="add">are</span> in his head; but the fool walketh in darkness: and I myself perceived also that one event happeneth
to them all.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C2V15">&nbsp;</a>Then said I in my heart, As it happeneth to the fool, so it happeneth even to me; and why was I then
more wise? Then I said in my heart, that this also
<span class="add">is</span> vanity.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C2V16">&nbsp;</a>For
<span class="add">there is</span> no remembrance of the wise more than of the fool for ever; seeing that which now
<span class="add">is</span> in the days to come shall all be forgotten. And how dieth the wise
<span class="add">man?</span> as the fool.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C2V17">&nbsp;</a>Therefore I hated life; because the work that is wrought under the sun is grievous unto me: for all
<span class="add">is</span> vanity and vexation of spirit.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C2V18">&nbsp;</a>Yea, I hated all my labour which I had taken under the sun: because I should leave it unto the man that
shall be after me.
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C2V19">&nbsp;</a>And who knoweth whether he shall be a wise
<span class="add">man</span> or a fool? yet shall he have rule over all my labour wherein I have laboured, and wherein I have shewed
myself wise under the sun. This
<span class="add">is</span> also vanity.
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C2V20">&nbsp;</a>Therefore I went about to cause my heart to despair of all the labour which I took under the sun.
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C2V21">&nbsp;</a>For there is a man whose labour
<span class="add">is</span> in wisdom, and in knowledge, and in equity; yet to a man that hath not laboured therein shall he leave
it
<span class="add">for</span> his portion. This also
<span class="add">is</span> vanity and a great evil.
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C2V22">&nbsp;</a>For what hath man of all his labour, and of the vexation of his heart, wherein he hath laboured under
the sun?
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C2V23">&nbsp;</a>For all his days
<span class="add">are</span> sorrows, and his travail grief; yea, his heart taketh not rest in the night. This is also vanity.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C2V24">&nbsp;</a><span class="add">There is</span> nothing better for a man,
<span class="add">than</span> that he should eat and drink, and
<span class="add">that</span> he should make his soul enjoy good in his labour. This also I saw, that it
<span class="add">was</span> from the hand of God.
 <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C2V25">&nbsp;</a>For who can eat, or who else can hasten
<span class="add">hereunto,</span> more than I?
 <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C2V26">&nbsp;</a>For
<span class="add">God</span> giveth to a man that
<span class="add">is</span> good in his sight wisdom, and knowledge, and joy: but to the sinner he giveth travail, to gather and
to heap up, that he may give to
<span class="add">him that is</span> good before God. This also
<span class="add">is</span> vanity and vexation of spirit.
