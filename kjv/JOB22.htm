 <span class="verse" id="V1">1&nbsp;</span>Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said,  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span>Can a man be profitable unto God, as he that is wise may be profitable unto himself?  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span> <span class='add'>Is it</span> any pleasure to the Almighty, that thou art righteous? or <span class='add'>is it</span> gain <span class='add'>to him</span> that thou makest thy ways perfect?  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>Will he reprove thee for fear of thee? will he enter with thee into judgment?  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span> <span class='add'>Is</span> not thy wickedness great? and thine iniquities infinite?  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>For thou hast taken a pledge from thy brother for nought, and stripped the naked of their clothing.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>Thou hast not given water to the weary to drink, and thou hast withholden bread from the hungry.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>But <span class='add'>as for</span> the mighty man, he had the earth; and the honourable man dwelt in it.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>Thou hast sent widows away empty, and the arms of the fatherless have been broken.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>Therefore snares <span class='add'>are</span> round about thee, and sudden fear troubleth thee;  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>Or darkness, <span class='add'>that</span> thou canst not see; and abundance of waters cover thee.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span> <span class='add'>Is</span> not God in the height of heaven? and behold the height of the stars, how high they are!  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>And thou sayest, How doth God know? can he judge through the dark cloud?  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>Thick clouds <span class='add'>are</span> a covering to him, that he seeth not; and he walketh in the circuit of heaven.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>Hast thou marked the old way which wicked men have trodden?  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>Which were cut down out of time, whose foundation was overflown with a flood:  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>Which said unto God, Depart from us: and what can the Almighty do for them?  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>Yet he filled their houses with good <span class='add'>things:</span> but the counsel of the wicked is far from me.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>The righteous see <span class='add'>it</span>, and are glad: and the innocent laugh them to scorn.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>Whereas our substance is not cut down, but the remnant of them the fire consumeth.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>Acquaint now thyself with him, and be at peace: thereby good shall come unto thee.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>Receive, I pray thee, the law from his mouth, and lay up his words in thine heart.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>If thou return to the Almighty, thou shalt be built up, thou shalt put away iniquity far from thy tabernacles.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>Then shalt thou lay up gold as dust, and the <span class='add'>gold</span> of Ophir as the stones of the brooks.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>Yea, the Almighty shall be thy defence, and thou shalt have plenty of silver.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>For then shalt thou have thy delight in the Almighty, and shalt lift up thy face unto God.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>Thou shalt make thy prayer unto him, and he shall hear thee, and thou shalt pay thy vows.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&nbsp;</span>Thou shalt also decree a thing, and it shall be established unto thee: and the light shall shine upon thy ways.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&nbsp;</span>When <span class='add'>men</span> are cast down, then thou shalt say, <span class='add'>There is</span> lifting up; and he shall save the humble person.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&nbsp;</span>He shall deliver the island of the innocent: and it is delivered by the pureness of thine hands. </div><ul class='tnav'>
