 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C3V1">&nbsp;</a>There was a man of the Pharisees, named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews:
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C3V2">&nbsp;</a>The same came to Jesus by night, and said unto him, Rabbi, we know that thou art a teacher come from
God: for no man can do these miracles that thou doest, except God be with him.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C3V3">&nbsp;</a>Jesus answered and said unto him,
<span class="wj">Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.
</span> <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C3V4">&nbsp;</a>Nicodemus saith unto him, How can a man be born when he is old? can he enter the second time into his
mother’s womb, and be born?
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C3V5">&nbsp;</a>Jesus answered,
<span class="wj">Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born of water and
</span><span class="add">of</span><span class="wj"> the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.
</span> <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C3V6">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.
</span> <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C3V7">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Marvel not that I said unto thee, Ye must be born again.
</span> <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C3V8">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">The wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the sound thereof, but canst not tell whence it cometh,
and whither it goeth: so is every one that is born of the Spirit.
</span> <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C3V9">&nbsp;</a>Nicodemus answered and said unto him, How can these things be?
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C3V10">&nbsp;</a>Jesus answered and said unto him,
<span class="wj">Art thou a master of Israel, and knowest not these things?
</span> <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C3V11">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Verily, verily, I say unto thee, We speak that we do know, and testify that we have seen; and ye receive
not our witness.
</span> <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C3V12">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">If I have told you earthly things, and ye believe not, how shall ye believe, if I tell you
</span><span class="add">of</span><span class="wj"> heavenly things?
</span> <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C3V13">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And no man hath ascended up to heaven, but he that came down from heaven,
</span><span class="add">even</span><span class="wj"> the Son of man which is in heaven.</span></div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C3V14">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of man be lifted up:
</span> <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C3V15">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">That whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have eternal life.</span></div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C3V16">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should
not perish, but have everlasting life.
</span> <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C3V17">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be
saved.</span></div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C3V18">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he
hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.
</span> <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C3V19">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light,
because their deeds were evil.
</span> <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C3V20">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">For every one that doeth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, lest his deeds should be
reproved.
</span> <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C3V21">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">But he that doeth truth cometh to the light, that his deeds may be made manifest, that they are wrought
in God.</span></div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C3V22">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">After these things came Jesus and his disciples into the land of Judaea; and there he tarried with them,
and baptized.</span></div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C3V23">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And John also was baptizing in Aenon near to Salim, because there was much water there: and they came,
and were baptized.
</span> <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C3V24">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">For John was not yet cast into prison.</span></div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C3V25">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Then there arose a question between
</span><span class="add">some</span><span class="wj"> of John’s disciples and the Jews about purifying.
</span> <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C3V26">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And they came unto John, and said unto him, Rabbi, he that was with thee beyond Jordan, to whom thou
barest witness, behold, the same baptizeth, and all
</span><span class="add">men</span><span class="wj"> come to him.
</span> <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C3V27">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">John answered and said, A man can receive nothing, except it be given him from heaven.
</span> <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C3V28">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Ye yourselves bear me witness, that I said, I am not the Christ, but that I am sent before him.
</span> <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C3V29">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">He that hath the bride is the bridegroom: but the friend of the bridegroom, which standeth and heareth
him, rejoiceth greatly because of the bridegroom’s voice: this my joy therefore is fulfilled.
</span> <span class="verse"> 30</span><a name="C3V30">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">He must increase, but I
</span><span class="add">must</span><span class="wj"> decrease.
</span> <span class="verse"> 31</span><a name="C3V31">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">He that cometh from above is above all: he that is of the earth is earthly, and speaketh of the earth:
he that cometh from heaven is above all.
</span> <span class="verse"> 32</span><a name="C3V32">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And what he hath seen and heard, that he testifieth; and no man receiveth his testimony.
</span> <span class="verse"> 33</span><a name="C3V33">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">He that hath received his testimony hath set to his seal that God is true.
</span> <span class="verse"> 34</span><a name="C3V34">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">For he whom God hath sent speaketh the words of God: for God giveth not the Spirit by measure
</span><span class="add">unto him.
</span> <span class="verse"> 35</span><a name="C3V35">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">The Father loveth the Son, and hath given all things into his hand.
</span> <span class="verse"> 36</span><a name="C3V36">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life: and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life;
but the wrath of God abideth on him.</span></div>
