 <span class="verse" id="V1">1&nbsp;</span>O give thanks unto the LORD; call upon his name: make known his deeds among the people. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span>Sing unto him, sing psalms unto him: talk ye of all his wondrous works. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>Glory ye in his holy name: let the heart of them rejoice that seek the LORD. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>Seek the LORD, and his strength: seek his face evermore. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>Remember his marvellous works that he hath done; his wonders, and the judgments of his mouth; </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>O ye seed of Abraham his servant, ye children of Jacob his chosen. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>He <span class='add'>is</span> the LORD our God: his judgments <span class='add'>are</span> in all the earth. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>He hath remembered his covenant for ever, the word <span class='add'>which</span> he commanded to a thousand generations. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>Which <span class='add'>covenant</span> he made with Abraham, and his oath unto Isaac;
