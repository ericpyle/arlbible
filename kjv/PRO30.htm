 <span class="verse" id="V1">1&nbsp;</span>The words of Agur the son of Jakeh, <span class='add'>even</span> the prophecy: the man spake unto Ithiel, even unto Ithiel and Ucal,  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span>Surely I <span class='add'>am</span> more brutish than <span class='add'>any</span> man, and have not the understanding of a man.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>I neither learned wisdom, nor have the knowledge of the holy.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>Who hath ascended up into heaven, or descended? who hath gathered the wind in his fists? who hath bound the waters in a garment? who hath established all the ends of the earth? what <span class='add'>is</span> his name, and what <span class='add'>is</span> his son’s name, if thou canst tell?  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>Every word of God <span class='add'>is</span> pure: he <span class='add'>is</span> a shield unto them that put their trust in him.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>Add thou not unto his words, lest he reprove thee, and thou be found a liar.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>Two <span class='add'>things</span> have I required of thee; deny me <span class='add'>them</span> not before I die:  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>Remove far from me vanity and lies: give me neither poverty nor riches; feed me with food convenient for me:  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>Lest I be full, and deny <span class='add'>thee</span>, and say, Who <span class='add'>is</span> the LORD? or lest I be poor, and steal, and take the name of my God <span class='add'>in vain</span>.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>Accuse not a servant unto his master, lest he curse thee, and thou be found guilty.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span> <span class='add'>There is</span> a generation <span class='add'>that</span> curseth their father, and doth not bless their mother.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span> <span class='add'>There is</span> a generation <span class='add'>that are</span> pure in their own eyes, and <span class='add'>yet</span> is not washed from their filthiness.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span> <span class='add'>There is</span> a generation, O how lofty are their eyes! and their eyelids are lifted up.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span> <span class='add'>There is</span> a generation, whose teeth <span class='add'>are as</span> swords, and their jaw teeth <span class='add'>as</span> knives, to devour the poor from off the earth, and the needy from <span class='add'>among</span> men.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>The horseleach hath two daughters, <span class='add'>crying</span>, Give, give. There are three <span class='add'>things that are</span> never satisfied, <span class='add'>yea</span>, four <span class='add'>things</span> say not, <span class='add'>It is</span> enough:  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>The grave; and the barren womb; the earth <span class='add'>that</span> is not filled with water; and the fire <span class='add'>that</span> saith not, <span class='add'>It is</span> enough.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>The eye <span class='add'>that</span> mocketh at <span class='add'>his</span> father, and despiseth to obey <span class='add'>his</span> mother, the ravens of the valley shall pick it out, and the young eagles shall eat it.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>There be three <span class='add'>things which</span> are too wonderful for me, yea, four which I know not:  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>The way of an eagle in the air; the way of a serpent upon a rock; the way of a ship in the midst of the sea; and the way of a man with a maid.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>Such <span class='add'>is</span> the way of an adulterous woman; she eateth, and wipeth her mouth, and saith, I have done no wickedness.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>For three <span class='add'>things</span> the earth is disquieted, and for four <span class='add'>which</span> it cannot bear:  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>For a servant when he reigneth; and a fool when he is filled with meat;  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>For an odious <span class='add'>woman</span> when she is married; and an handmaid that is heir to her mistress.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>There be four <span class='add'>things which are</span> little upon the earth, but they <span class='add'>are</span> exceeding wise:  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>The ants <span class='add'>are</span> a people not strong, yet they prepare their meat in the summer;  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>The conies <span class='add'>are but</span> a feeble folk, yet make they their houses in the rocks;  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>The locusts have no king, yet go they forth all of them by bands;  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&nbsp;</span>The spider taketh hold with her hands, and is in kings’ palaces.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&nbsp;</span>There be three <span class='add'>things</span> which go well, yea, four are comely in going:  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&nbsp;</span>A lion <span class='add'>which is</span> strongest among beasts, and turneth not away for any;  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&nbsp;</span>A greyhound; an he goat also; and a king, against whom <span class='add'>there is</span> no rising up.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&nbsp;</span>If thou hast done foolishly in lifting up thyself, or if thou hast thought evil, <span class='add'>lay</span> thine hand upon thy mouth.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&nbsp;</span>Surely the churning of milk bringeth forth butter, and the wringing of the nose bringeth forth blood: so the forcing of wrath bringeth forth strife. </div><ul class='tnav'>
