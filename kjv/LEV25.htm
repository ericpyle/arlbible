 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C25V1">&nbsp;</a>And the LORD spake unto Moses in mount Sinai, saying,
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C25V2">&nbsp;</a>Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye come into the land which I give you, then
shall the land keep a sabbath unto the LORD.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C25V3">&nbsp;</a>Six years thou shalt sow thy field, and six years thou shalt prune thy vineyard, and gather in the fruit
thereof;
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C25V4">&nbsp;</a>But in the seventh year shall be a sabbath of rest unto the land, a sabbath for the LORD: thou shalt
neither sow thy field, nor prune thy vineyard.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C25V5">&nbsp;</a>That which groweth of its own accord of thy harvest thou shalt not reap, neither gather the grapes of
thy vine undressed:
<span class="add">for</span> it is a year of rest unto the land.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C25V6">&nbsp;</a>And the sabbath of the land shall be meat for you; for thee, and for thy servant, and for thy maid, and
for thy hired servant, and for thy stranger that sojourneth with thee,
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C25V7">&nbsp;</a>And for thy cattle, and for the beast that
<span class="add">are</span> in thy land, shall all the increase thereof be meat.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C25V8">&nbsp;</a>And thou shalt number seven sabbaths of years unto thee, seven times seven years; and the space of the
seven sabbaths of years shall be unto thee forty and nine years.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C25V9">&nbsp;</a>Then shalt thou cause the trumpet of the jubile to sound on the tenth
<span class="add">day</span> of the seventh month, in the day of atonement shall ye make the trumpet sound throughout all your land.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C25V10">&nbsp;</a>And ye shall hallow the fiftieth year, and proclaim liberty throughout
<span class="add">all</span> the land unto all the inhabitants thereof: it shall be a jubile unto you; and ye shall return every
man unto his possession, and ye shall return every man unto his family.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C25V11">&nbsp;</a>A jubile shall that fiftieth year be unto you: ye shall not sow, neither reap that which groweth of itself
in it, nor gather
<span class="add">the grapes
</span> in it of thy vine undressed.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C25V12">&nbsp;</a>For it
<span class="add">is</span> the jubile; it shall be holy unto you: ye shall eat the increase thereof out of the field.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C25V13">&nbsp;</a>In the year of this jubile ye shall return every man unto his possession.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C25V14">&nbsp;</a>And if thou sell
<span class="add">ought</span> unto thy neighbour, or buyest ought of thy neighbour’s hand, ye shall not oppress one another:
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C25V15">&nbsp;</a>According to the number of years after the jubile thou shalt buy of thy neighbour,
<span class="add">and</span> according unto the number of years of the fruits he shall sell unto thee:
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C25V16">&nbsp;</a>According to the multitude of years thou shalt increase the price thereof, and according to the fewness
of years thou shalt diminish the price of it: for
<span class="add">according</span> to the number
<span class="add">of the years</span> of the fruits doth he sell unto thee.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C25V17">&nbsp;</a>Ye shall not therefore oppress one another; but thou shalt fear thy God: for I
<span class="add">am</span> the LORD your God.

<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C25V18">&nbsp;</a>Wherefore ye shall do my statutes, and keep my judgments, and do them; and ye shall dwell in the land
in safety.

 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C25V20">&nbsp;</a>And if ye shall say, What shall we eat the seventh year? behold, we shall not sow, nor gather in our
increase:
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C25V21">&nbsp;</a>Then I will command my blessing upon you in the sixth year, and it shall bring forth fruit for three
years.
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C25V22">&nbsp;</a>And ye shall sow the eighth year, and eat
<span class="add">yet</span> of old fruit until the ninth year; until her fruits come in ye shall eat

</span> the old
<span class="add">store.</span></div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C25V23">&nbsp;</a>The land shall not be sold for ever: for the land

sold.
 <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C25V26">&nbsp;</a>And if the man have none to redeem it, and himself be able to redeem it;
 <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C25V27">&nbsp;</a>Then let him count the years of the sale thereof, and restore the overplus unto the man to whom he sold
it; that he may return unto his possession.
 <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C25V28">&nbsp;</a>But if he be not able to restore
<span class="add">it</span> to him, then that which is sold shall remain in the hand of him that hath bought it until the year of
jubile: and in the jubile it shall go out, and he shall return unto his possession.
 <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C25V29">&nbsp;</a>And if a man sell a dwelling house in a walled city, then he may redeem it within a whole year after
it is sold;
<span class="add">within</span> a full year may he redeem it.
 <span class="verse"> 30</span><a name="C25V30">&nbsp;</a>And if it be not redeemed within the space of a full year, then the house that
<span class="add">is</span> in the walled city shall be established for ever to him that bought it throughout his generations: it
shall not go out in the jubile.
 <span class="verse"> 31</span><a name="C25V31">&nbsp;</a>But the houses of the villages which have no wall round about them shall be counted as the fields of
the country: they may be redeemed, and they shall go out in the jubile.
 <span class="verse"> 32</span><a name="C25V32">&nbsp;</a>Notwithstanding the cities of the Levites,
<span class="add">and</span> the houses of the cities of their possession, may the Levites redeem at any time.
 <span class="verse"> 33</span><a name="C25V33">&nbsp;</a>And if a man purchase of the Levites, then the house that was sold, and the city of his possession, shall
go out in
<span class="add">the year of</span> jubile: for the houses of the cities of the Levites
<span class="add">are</span> their possession among the children of Israel.
 <span class="verse"> 34</span><a name="C25V34">&nbsp;</a>But the field of the suburbs of their cities may not be sold; for it is their perpetual possession.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 35</span><a name="C25V35">&nbsp;</a>And if thy brother be waxen poor, and fallen in decay with thee; then thou shalt relieve him:
<span class="add">yea, though he be</span> a stranger, or a sojourner; that he may live with thee.
 <span class="verse"> 36</span><a name="C25V36">&nbsp;</a>Take thou no usury of him, or increase: but fear thy God; that thy brother may live with thee.
 <span class="verse"> 37</span><a name="C25V37">&nbsp;</a>Thou shalt not give him thy money upon usury, nor lend him thy victuals for increase.
 <span class="verse"> 38</span><a name="C25V38">&nbsp;</a>I
<span class="add">am</span> the LORD your God, which brought you forth out of the land of Egypt, to give you the land of Canaan,

<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 39</span><a name="C25V39">&nbsp;</a>And if thy brother

 <span class="verse"> 40</span><a name="C25V40">&nbsp;</a><span class="add">But</span> as an hired servant,
<span class="add">and</span> as a sojourner, he shall be with thee,
<span class="add">and</span> shall serve thee unto the year of jubile:

<span class="add">then</span> shall he depart from thee,
<span class="add">both</span> he and his children with him, and shall return unto his own family, and unto the possession of his fathers
shall he return.
 <span class="verse"> 42</span><a name="C25V42">&nbsp;</a>For they
<span class="add">are</span> my servants, which I brought forth out of the land of Egypt: they shall not be sold as bondmen.
 <span class="verse"> 43</span><a name="C25V43">&nbsp;</a>Thou shalt not rule over him with rigour; but shalt fear thy God.
 <span class="verse"> 44</span><a name="C25V44">&nbsp;</a>Both thy bondmen, and thy bondmaids, which thou shalt have,
<span class="add">shall be</span> of the heathen that are round about you; of them shall ye buy bondmen and bondmaids.
 <span class="verse"> 45</span><a name="C25V45">&nbsp;</a>Moreover of the children of the strangers that do sojourn among you, of them shall ye buy, and of their
families that
<span class="add">are</span> with you, which they begat in your land: and they shall be your possession.
 <span class="verse"> 46</span><a name="C25V46">&nbsp;</a>And ye shall take them as an inheritance for your children after you, to inherit
<span class="add">them for</span> a possession; they shall be your bondmen for ever: but over your brethren the children of Israel, ye
shall not rule one over another with rigour.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 47</span><a name="C25V47">&nbsp;</a>And if a sojourner or stranger wax rich by thee, and thy brother
<span class="add">that dwelleth</span> by him wax poor, and sell himself unto the stranger
<span class="add">or</span> sojourner by thee, or to the stock of the stranger’s family:
 <span class="verse"> 48</span><a name="C25V48">&nbsp;</a>After that he is sold he may be redeemed again; one of his brethren may redeem him:
 <span class="verse"> 49</span><a name="C25V49">&nbsp;</a>Either his uncle, or his uncle’s son, may redeem him, or
<span class="add">any
</span> that is nigh of kin unto him of his family may redeem him; or if he be able, he may redeem himself.
 <span class="verse"> 50</span><a name="C25V50">&nbsp;</a>And he shall reckon with him that bought him from the year that he was sold to him unto the year of jubile:
and the price of his sale shall be according unto the number of years, according to the time of an hired
servant shall it be with him.
 <span class="verse"> 51</span><a name="C25V51">&nbsp;</a>If
<span class="add">there be</span> yet many years
<span class="add">behind,</span> according unto them he shall give again the price of his redemption out of the money that he was bought
for.
 <span class="verse"> 52</span><a name="C25V52">&nbsp;</a>And if there remain but few years unto the year of jubile, then he shall count with him,
<span class="add">and</span> according unto his years shall he give him again the price of his redemption.
 <span class="verse"> 53</span><a name="C25V53">&nbsp;</a><span class="add">And</span> as a yearly hired servant shall he be with him:
<span class="add">and the other</span> shall not rule with rigour over him in thy sight.
 <span class="verse"> 54</span><a name="C25V54">&nbsp;</a>And if he be not redeemed in these
<span class="add">years,</span> then he shall go out in the year of jubile,
<span class="add">both</span> he, and his children with him.
 <span class="verse"> 55</span><a name="C25V55">&nbsp;</a>For unto me the children of Israel
<span class="add">are</span> servants; they
<span class="add">are</span> my servants whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt: I
<span class="add">am</span> the LORD your God.
