 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C3V1">&nbsp;</a>But the souls of the righteous are in the hand of God, and there shall no torment touch them.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C3V2">&nbsp;</a>In the sight of the unwise they seemed to die: and their departure is taken for misery,
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C3V3">&nbsp;</a>And their going from us to be utter destruction: but they are in peace.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C3V4">&nbsp;</a>For though they be punished in the sight of men, yet is their hope full of immortality.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C3V5">&nbsp;</a>And having been a little chastised, they shall be greatly rewarded: for God proved them, and found them
worthy for himself.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C3V6">&nbsp;</a>As gold in the furnace hath he tried them, and received them as a burnt offering.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C3V7">&nbsp;</a>And in the time of their visitation they shall shine, and run to and fro like sparks among the stubble.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C3V8">&nbsp;</a>They shall judge the nations, and have dominion over the people, and their Lord shall reign for ever.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C3V9">&nbsp;</a>They that put their trust in him shall understand the truth: and such as be faithful in love shall abide
with him: for grace and mercy is to his saints, and he hath care for his elect.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C3V10">&nbsp;</a>But the ungodly shall be punished according to their own imaginations, which have neglected the righteous,
and forsaken the Lord.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C3V11">&nbsp;</a>For whoso despiseth wisdom and nurture, he is miserable, and their hope is vain, their labours unfruitful,
and their works unprofitable:
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C3V12">&nbsp;</a>Their wives are foolish, and their children wicked:
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C3V13">&nbsp;</a>Their offspring is cursed. Wherefore blessed is the barren that is undefiled, which hath not known the
sinful bed: she shall have fruit in the visitation of souls.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C3V14">&nbsp;</a>And blessed is the eunuch, which with his hands hath wrought no iniquity, nor imagined wicked things
against God: for unto him shall be given the special gift of faith, and an inheritance in the temple
of the Lord more acceptable to his mind.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C3V15">&nbsp;</a>For glorious is the fruit of good labours: and the root of wisdom shall never fall away.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C3V16">&nbsp;</a>As for the children of adulterers, they shall not come to their perfection, and the seed of an unrighteous
bed shall be rooted out.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C3V17">&nbsp;</a>For though they live long, yet shall they be nothing regarded: and their last age shall be without honour.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C3V18">&nbsp;</a>Or, if they die quickly, they have no hope, neither comfort in the day of trial.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C3V19">&nbsp;</a>For horrible is the end of the unrighteous generation.
