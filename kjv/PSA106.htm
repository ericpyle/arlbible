 <span class="verse" id="V1">1&nbsp;</span>Praise ye the LORD. O give thanks unto the LORD; for <span class='add'>he is</span> good: for his mercy <span class='add'>endureth</span> for ever. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span>Who can utter the mighty acts of the LORD? <span class='add'>who</span> can shew forth all his praise? </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>Blessed <span class='add'>are</span> they that keep judgment, <span class='add'>and</span> he that doeth righteousness at all times. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>Remember me, O LORD, with the favour <span class='add'>that thou bearest unto</span> thy people: O visit me with thy salvation; </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>That I may see the good of thy chosen, that I may rejoice in the gladness of thy nation, that I may glory with thine inheritance. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>We have sinned with our fathers, we have committed iniquity, we have done wickedly. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>Our fathers understood not thy wonders in Egypt; they remembered not the multitude of thy mercies; but provoked <span class='add'>him</span> at the sea, <span class='add'>even</span> at the Red sea. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>Nevertheless he saved them for his name’s sake, that he might make his mighty power to be known. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>He rebuked the Red sea also, and it was dried up: so he led them through the depths, as through the wilderness. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>And he saved them from the hand of him that hated <span class='add'>them</span>, and redeemed them from the hand of the enemy. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>And the waters covered their enemies: there was not one of them left. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>Then believed they his words; they sang his praise. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>They soon forgat his works; they waited not for his counsel: </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>But lusted exceedingly in the wilderness, and tempted God in the desert. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>And he gave them their request; but sent leanness into their soul. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>They envied Moses also in the camp, <span class='add'>and</span> Aaron the saint of the LORD. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan, and covered the company of Abiram. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>And a fire was kindled in their company; the flame burned up the wicked. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>They made a calf in Horeb, and worshipped the molten image. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>Thus they changed their glory into the similitude of an ox that eateth grass. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>They forgat God their saviour, which had done great things in Egypt; </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>Wondrous works in the land of Ham, <span class='add'>and</span> terrible things by the Red sea. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>Therefore he said that he would destroy them, had not Moses his chosen stood before him in the breach, to turn away his wrath, lest he should destroy <span class='add'>them</span>. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>Yea, they despised the pleasant land, they believed not his word: </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>But murmured in their tents, <span class='add'>and</span> hearkened not unto the voice of the LORD. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>Therefore he lifted up his hand against them, to overthrow them in the wilderness: </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>To overthrow their seed also among the nations, and to scatter them in the lands. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V28">28&nbsp;</span>They joined themselves also unto Baal-peor, and ate the sacrifices of the dead. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V29">29&nbsp;</span>Thus they provoked <span class='add'>him</span> to anger with their inventions: and the plague brake in upon them. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V30">30&nbsp;</span>Then stood up Phinehas, and executed judgment: and <span class='add'>so</span> the plague was stayed. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V31">31&nbsp;</span>And that was counted unto him for righteousness unto all generations for evermore. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V32">32&nbsp;</span>They angered <span class='add'>him</span> also at the waters of strife, so that it went ill with Moses for their sakes: </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V33">33&nbsp;</span>Because they provoked his spirit, so that he spake unadvisedly with his lips. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V34">34&nbsp;</span>They did not destroy the nations, concerning whom the LORD commanded them: </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V35">35&nbsp;</span>But were mingled among the heathen, and learned their works. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V36">36&nbsp;</span>And they served their idols: which were a snare unto them. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V37">37&nbsp;</span>Yea, they sacrificed their sons and their daughters unto devils, </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V38">38&nbsp;</span>And shed innocent blood, <span class='add'>even</span> the blood of their sons and of their daughters, whom they sacrificed unto the idols of Canaan: and the land was polluted with blood. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V39">39&nbsp;</span>Thus were they defiled with their own works, and went a whoring with their own inventions. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V40">40&nbsp;</span>Therefore was the wrath of the LORD kindled against his people, insomuch that he abhorred his own inheritance. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V41">41&nbsp;</span>And he gave them into the hand of the heathen;
