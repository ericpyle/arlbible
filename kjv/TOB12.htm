 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C12V1">&nbsp;</a>Then Tobit called his son Tobias, and said unto him, My son, see that the man have his wages, which went
with thee, and thou must give him more.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C12V2">&nbsp;</a>And Tobias said unto him, O father, it is no harm to me to give him half of those things which I have
brought:
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C12V3">&nbsp;</a>For he hath brought me again to thee in safety, and made whole my wife, and brought me the money, and
likewise healed thee.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C12V4">&nbsp;</a>Then the old man said, It is due unto him.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C12V5">&nbsp;</a>So he called the angel, and he said unto him, Take half of all that ye have brought and go away in safety.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C12V6">&nbsp;</a>Then he took them both apart, and said unto them, Bless God, praise him, and magnify him, and praise
him for the things which he hath done unto you in the sight of all that live. It is good to praise God,
and exalt his name, and honourably to shew forth the works of God; therefore be not slack to praise him.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C12V7">&nbsp;</a>It is good to keep close the secret of a king, but it is honourable to reveal the works of God. Do that
which is good, and no evil shall touch you.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C12V8">&nbsp;</a>Prayer is good with fasting and alms and righteousness. A little with righteousness is better than much
with unrighteousness. It is better to give alms than to lay up gold:
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C12V9">&nbsp;</a>For alms doth deliver from death, and shall purge away all sin. Those that exercise alms and righteousness
shall be filled with life:
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C12V10">&nbsp;</a>But they that sin are enemies to their own life.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C12V11">&nbsp;</a>Surely I will keep close nothing from you. For I said, It was good to keep close the secret of a king,
but that it was honourable to reveal the works of God.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C12V12">&nbsp;</a>Now therefore, when thou didst pray, and Sara thy daughter in law, I did bring the remembrance of your
prayers before the Holy One: and when thou didst bury the dead, I was with thee likewise.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C12V13">&nbsp;</a>And when thou didst not delay to rise up, and leave thy dinner, to go and cover the dead, thy good deed
was not hid from me: but I was with thee.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C12V14">&nbsp;</a>And now God hath sent me to heal thee and Sara thy daughter in law.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C12V15">&nbsp;</a>I am Raphael, one of the seven holy angels, which present the prayers of the saints, and which go in
and out before the glory of the Holy One.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C12V16">&nbsp;</a>Then they were both troubled, and fell upon their faces: for they feared.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C12V17">&nbsp;</a>But he said unto them, Fear not, for it shall go well with you; praise God therefore.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C12V18">&nbsp;</a>For not of any favour of mine, but by the will of our God I came; wherefore praise him for ever.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C12V19">&nbsp;</a>All these days I did appear unto you; but I did neither eat nor drink, but ye did see a vision.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C12V20">&nbsp;</a>Now therefore give God thanks: for I go up to him that sent me; but write all things which are done in
a book.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C12V21">&nbsp;</a>And when they arose, they saw him no more.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C12V22">&nbsp;</a>Then they confessed the great and wonderful works of God, and how the angel of the Lord had appeared
unto them.
