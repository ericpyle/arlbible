<span class="add">was</span> twenty and three years old when he began to reign, and he reigned three months in Jerusalem.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C36V3">&nbsp;</a>And the king of Egypt put him down at Jerusalem, and condemned the land in an hundred talents of silver
and a talent of gold.

<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C36V4">&nbsp;</a>And the king of Egypt made Eliakim his brother king over Judah and Jerusalem, and turned his name to
Jehoiakim. And Necho took Jehoahaz his brother, and carried him to Egypt.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C36V5">&nbsp;</a>Jehoiakim
<span class="add">was</span> twenty and five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem: and he did
<span class="add">that which was

 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C36V6">&nbsp;</a>Against him came up Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and bound him in fetters, to carry him to Babylon.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C36V7">&nbsp;</a>Nebuchadnezzar also carried of the vessels of the house of the LORD to Babylon, and put them in his temple
at Babylon.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C36V8">&nbsp;</a>Now the rest of the acts of Jehoiakim, and his abominations which he did, and that which was found in

 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C36V13">&nbsp;</a>And he also rebelled against king Nebuchadnezzar, who had made him swear by God: but he stiffened his
neck, and hardened his heart from turning unto the LORD God of Israel.

<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C36V14">&nbsp;</a>Moreover all the chief of the priests, and the people, transgressed very much after all the abominations
of the heathen; and polluted the house of the LORD which he had hallowed in Jerusalem.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C36V15">&nbsp;</a>And the LORD God of their fathers sent to them by his messengers, rising up betimes, and sending; because
he had compassion on his people, and on his dwelling place:
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C36V16">&nbsp;</a>But they mocked the messengers of God, and despised his words, and misused his prophets, until the wrath
of the LORD arose against his people, till
<span class="add">there was</span> no remedy.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C36V17">&nbsp;</a>Therefore he brought upon them the king of the Chaldees, who slew their young men with the sword in the
house of their sanctuary, and had no compassion upon young man or maiden, old man, or him that stooped
for age: he gave
<span class="add">them</span> all into his hand.
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C36V18">&nbsp;</a>And all the vessels of the house of God, great and small, and the treasures of the house of the LORD,
and the treasures of the king, and of his princes; all
<span class="add">these</span> he brought to Babylon.
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C36V19">&nbsp;</a>And they burnt the house of God, and brake down the wall of Jerusalem, and burnt all the palaces thereof
with fire, and destroyed all the goodly vessels thereof.
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C36V20">&nbsp;</a>And them that had escaped from the sword carried he away to Babylon; where they were servants to him
and his sons until the reign of the kingdom of Persia:

<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C36V22">&nbsp;</a>Now in the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, that the word of the LORD
<span class="add">spoken</span> by the mouth of Jeremiah might be accomplished, the LORD stirred up the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia,
that he made a proclamation throughout all his kingdom, and
<span class="add">put it</span> also in writing, saying,
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C36V23">&nbsp;</a>Thus saith Cyrus king of Persia, All the kingdoms of the earth hath the LORD God of heaven given me;
and he hath charged me to build him an house in Jerusalem, which
<span class="add">is</span> in Judah. Who
<span class="add">is there</span> among you of all his people? The LORD his God
<span class="add">be</span> with him, and let him go up.
