<div class="chapterlabel"> 4</div><div class="p">
 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C4V1">&nbsp;</a>And as they spake unto the people, the priests, and the captain of the temple, and the Sadducees, came
upon them,
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C4V2">&nbsp;</a>Being grieved that they taught the people, and preached through Jesus the resurrection from the dead.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C4V3">&nbsp;</a>And they laid hands on them, and put
<span class="add">them</span> in hold unto the next day: for it was now eventide.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C4V4">&nbsp;</a>Howbeit many of them which heard the word believed; and the number of the men was about five thousand.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C4V5">&nbsp;</a>And it came to pass on the morrow, that their rulers, and elders, and scribes,
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C4V6">&nbsp;</a>And Annas the high priest, and Caiaphas, and John, and Alexander, and as many as were of the kindred
of the high priest, were gathered together at Jerusalem.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C4V7">&nbsp;</a>And when they had set them in the midst, they asked, By what power, or by what name, have ye done this?
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C4V8">&nbsp;</a>Then Peter, filled with the Holy Ghost, said unto them, Ye rulers of the people, and elders of Israel,
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C4V9">&nbsp;</a>If we this day be examined of the good deed done to the impotent man, by what means he is made whole;
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C4V10">&nbsp;</a>Be it known unto you all, and to all the people of Israel, that by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth,
whom ye crucified, whom God raised from the dead,
<span class="add">even</span> by him doth this man stand here before you whole.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C4V11">&nbsp;</a>This is the stone which was set at nought of you builders, which is become the head of the corner.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C4V12">&nbsp;</a>Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby
we must be saved.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C4V13">&nbsp;</a>Now when they saw the boldness of Peter and John, and perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant
men, they marvelled; and they took knowledge of them, that they had been with Jesus.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C4V14">&nbsp;</a>And beholding the man which was healed standing with them, they could say nothing against it.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C4V15">&nbsp;</a>But when they had commanded them to go aside out of the council, they conferred among themselves,
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C4V16">&nbsp;</a>Saying, What shall we do to these men? for that indeed a notable miracle hath been done by them
<span class="add">is</span> manifest to all them that dwell in Jerusalem; and we cannot deny
<span class="add">it.
</span> <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C4V17">&nbsp;</a>But that it spread no further among the people, let us straitly threaten them, that they speak henceforth
to no man in this name.
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C4V18">&nbsp;</a>And they called them, and commanded them not to speak at all nor teach in the name of Jesus.
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C4V19">&nbsp;</a>But Peter and John answered and said unto them, Whether it be right in the sight of God to hearken unto
you more than unto God, judge ye.
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C4V20">&nbsp;</a>For we cannot but speak the things which we have seen and heard.
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C4V21">&nbsp;</a>So when they had further threatened them, they let them go, finding nothing how they might punish them,
because of the people: for all
<span class="add">men
</span> glorified God for that which was done.
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C4V22">&nbsp;</a>For the man was above forty years old, on whom this miracle of healing was shewed.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C4V23">&nbsp;</a>And being let go, they went to their own company, and reported all that the chief priests and elders
had said unto them.
 <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C4V24">&nbsp;</a>And when they heard that, they lifted up their voice to God with one accord, and said, Lord, thou
<span class="add">art</span> God, which hast made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and all that in them is:
 <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C4V25">&nbsp;</a>Who by the mouth of thy servant David hast said, Why did the heathen rage, and the people imagine vain
things?
 <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C4V26">&nbsp;</a>The kings of the earth stood up, and the rulers were gathered together against the Lord, and against
his Christ.
 <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C4V27">&nbsp;</a>For of a truth against thy holy child Jesus, whom thou hast anointed, both Herod, and Pontius Pilate,
with the Gentiles, and the people of Israel, were gathered together,
 <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C4V28">&nbsp;</a>For to do whatsoever thy hand and thy counsel determined before to be done.
 <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C4V29">&nbsp;</a>And now, Lord, behold their threatenings: and grant unto thy servants, that with all boldness they may
speak thy word,
 <span class="verse"> 30</span><a name="C4V30">&nbsp;</a>By stretching forth thine hand to heal; and that signs and wonders may be done by the name of thy holy
child Jesus.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 31</span><a name="C4V31">&nbsp;</a>And when they had prayed, the place was shaken where they were assembled together; and they were all
filled with the Holy Ghost, and they spake the word of God with boldness.
 <span class="verse"> 32</span><a name="C4V32">&nbsp;</a>And the multitude of them that believed were of one heart and of one soul: neither said any
<span class="add">of them</span> that ought of the things which he possessed was his own; but they had all things common.
 <span class="verse"> 33</span><a name="C4V33">&nbsp;</a>And with great power gave the apostles witness of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus: and great grace
was upon them all.
 <span class="verse"> 34</span><a name="C4V34">&nbsp;</a>Neither was there any among them that lacked: for as many as were possessors of lands or houses sold
them, and brought the prices of the things that were sold,
 <span class="verse"> 35</span><a name="C4V35">&nbsp;</a>And laid
<span class="add">them</span> down at the apostles’ feet: and distribution was made unto every man according as he had need.
 <span class="verse"> 36</span><a name="C4V36">&nbsp;</a>And Joses, who by the apostles was surnamed Barnabas, (which is, being interpreted, The son of consolation,)
a Levite,
<span class="add">and</span> of the country of Cyprus,
 <span class="verse"> 37</span><a name="C4V37">&nbsp;</a>Having land, sold
<span class="add">it,</span> and brought the money, and laid
<span class="add">it</span> at the apostles’ feet.
