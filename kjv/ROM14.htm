 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C14V1">&nbsp;</a>Him that is weak in the faith receive ye,
<span class="add">but</span> not to doubtful disputations.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C14V2">&nbsp;</a>For one believeth that he may eat all things: another, who is weak, eateth herbs.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C14V3">&nbsp;</a>Let not him that eateth despise him that eateth not; and let not him which eateth not judge him that
eateth: for God hath received him.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C14V4">&nbsp;</a>Who art thou that judgest another man’s servant? to his own master he standeth or falleth. Yea, he shall
be holden up: for God is able to make him stand.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C14V5">&nbsp;</a>One man esteemeth one day above another: another esteemeth every day
<span class="add">alike.</span> Let every man be fully persuaded in his own mind.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C14V6">&nbsp;</a>He that regardeth the day, regardeth
<span class="add">it</span> unto the Lord; and he that regardeth not the day, to the Lord he doth not regard
<span class="add">it.
</span> He that eateth, eateth to the Lord, for he giveth God thanks; and he that eateth not, to the Lord he
eateth not, and giveth God thanks.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C14V7">&nbsp;</a>For none of us liveth to himself, and no man dieth to himself.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C14V8">&nbsp;</a>For whether we live, we live unto the Lord; and whether we die, we die unto the Lord: whether we live
therefore, or die, we are the Lord’s.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C14V9">&nbsp;</a>For to this end Christ both died, and rose, and revived, that he might be Lord both of the dead and living.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C14V10">&nbsp;</a>But why dost thou judge thy brother? or why dost thou set at nought thy brother? for we shall all stand
before the judgment seat of Christ.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C14V11">&nbsp;</a>For it is written,
<span class="add">As</span> I live, saith the Lord, every knee shall bow to me, and every tongue shall confess to God.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C14V12">&nbsp;</a>So then every one of us shall give account of himself to God.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C14V13">&nbsp;</a>Let us not therefore judge one another any more: but judge this rather, that no man put a stumblingblock
or an occasion to fall in
<span class="add">his
</span> brother’s way.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C14V14">&nbsp;</a>I know, and am persuaded by the Lord Jesus, that
<span class="add">there is
</span> nothing unclean of itself: but to him that esteemeth any thing to be unclean, to him
<span class="add">it is</span> unclean.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C14V15">&nbsp;</a>But if thy brother be grieved with
<span class="add">thy</span> meat, now walkest thou not charitably. Destroy not him with thy meat, for whom Christ died.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C14V16">&nbsp;</a>Let not then your good be evil spoken of:
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C14V17">&nbsp;</a>For the kingdom of God is not meat and drink; but righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost.
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C14V18">&nbsp;</a>For he that in these things serveth Christ
<span class="add">is</span> acceptable to God, and approved of men.
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C14V19">&nbsp;</a>Let us therefore follow after the things which make for peace, and things wherewith one may edify another.
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C14V20">&nbsp;</a>For meat destroy not the work of God. All things indeed
<span class="add">are
</span> pure; but
<span class="add">it is</span> evil for that man who eateth with offence.
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C14V21">&nbsp;</a><span class="add">It is</span> good neither to eat flesh, nor to drink wine, nor
<span class="add">any thing</span> whereby thy brother stumbleth, or is offended, or is made weak.
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C14V22">&nbsp;</a>Hast thou faith? have
<span class="add">it</span> to thyself before God. Happy
<span class="add">is</span> he that condemneth not himself in that thing which he alloweth.
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C14V23">&nbsp;</a>And he that doubteth is damned if he eat, because
<span class="add">he eateth
</span> not of faith: for whatsoever
<span class="add">is</span> not of faith is sin.
