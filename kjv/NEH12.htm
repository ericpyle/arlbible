<span class="add">were</span> in the days of Joiakim the son of Jeshua, the son of Jozadak, and in the days of Nehemiah the governor,
and of Ezra the priest, the scribe.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C12V27">&nbsp;</a>And at the dedication of the wall of Jerusalem they sought the Levites out of all their places, to bring
them to Jerusalem, to keep the dedication with gladness, both with thanksgivings, and with singing,
<span class="add">with</span> cymbals, psalteries, and with harps.
 <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C12V28">&nbsp;</a>And the sons of the singers gathered themselves together, both out of the plain country round about Jerusalem,
and from the villages of Netophathi;
 <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C12V29">&nbsp;</a>Also from the house of Gilgal, and out of the fields of Geba and Azmaveth: for the singers had builded
them villages round about Jerusalem.
 <span class="verse"> 30</span><a name="C12V30">&nbsp;</a>And the priests and the Levites purified themselves, and purified the people, and the gates, and the
wall.
 <span class="verse"> 31</span><a name="C12V31">&nbsp;</a>Then I brought up the princes of Judah upon the wall, and appointed two great
<span class="add">companies of them that gave</span> thanks,
<span class="add">whereof one</span> went on the right hand upon the wall toward the dung gate:
 <span class="verse"> 32</span><a name="C12V32">&nbsp;</a>And after them went Hoshaiah, and half of the princes of Judah,
 <span class="verse"> 33</span><a name="C12V33">&nbsp;</a>And Azariah, Ezra, and Meshullam,
 <span class="verse"> 34</span><a name="C12V34">&nbsp;</a>Judah, and Benjamin, and Shemaiah, and Jeremiah,
 <span class="verse"> 35</span><a name="C12V35">&nbsp;</a>And
<span class="add">certain</span> of the priests’ sons with trumpets;
<span class="add">namely,</span> Zechariah the son of Jonathan, the son of Shemaiah, the son of Mattaniah, the son of Michaiah, the son
of Zaccur, the son of Asaph:
 <span class="verse"> 36</span><a name="C12V36">&nbsp;</a>And his brethren, Shemaiah, and Azarael, Milalai, Gilalai, Maai, Nethaneel, and Judah, Hanani, with the
musical instruments of David the man of God, and Ezra the scribe before them.
 <span class="verse"> 37</span><a name="C12V37">&nbsp;</a>And at the fountain gate, which was over against them, they went up by the stairs of the city of David,
at the going up of the wall, above the house of David, even unto the water gate eastward.
 <span class="verse"> 38</span><a name="C12V38">&nbsp;</a>And the other
<span class="add">company of them that gave</span> thanks went over against
<span class="add">them,</span> and I after them, and the half of the people upon the wall, from beyond the tower of the furnaces even
unto the broad wall;
 <span class="verse"> 39</span><a name="C12V39">&nbsp;</a>And from above the gate of Ephraim, and above the old gate, and above the fish gate, and the tower of
Hananeel, and the tower of Meah, even unto the sheep gate: and they stood still in the prison gate.
 <span class="verse"> 40</span><a name="C12V40">&nbsp;</a>So stood the two
<span class="add">companies of them that gave</span> thanks in the house of God, and I, and the half of the rulers with me:
 <span class="verse"> 41</span><a name="C12V41">&nbsp;</a>And the priests; Eliakim, Maaseiah, Miniamin, Michaiah, Elioenai, Zechariah,
<span class="add">and</span> Hananiah, with trumpets;
 <span class="verse"> 42</span><a name="C12V42">&nbsp;</a>And Maaseiah, and Shemaiah, and Eleazar, and Uzzi, and Jehohanan, and Malchijah, and Elam, and Ezer.
And the singers sang loud, with Jezrahiah
<span class="add">their</span> overseer.
 <span class="verse"> 43</span><a name="C12V43">&nbsp;</a>Also that day they offered great sacrifices, and rejoiced: for God had made them rejoice with great joy:
the wives also and the children rejoiced: so that the joy of Jerusalem was heard even afar off.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 44</span><a name="C12V44">&nbsp;</a>And at that time were some appointed over the chambers for the treasures, for the offerings, for the
firstfruits, and for the tithes, to gather into them out of the fields of the cities the portions of
the law for the priests and Levites: for Judah rejoiced for the priests and for the Levites that waited.
 <span class="verse"> 45</span><a name="C12V45">&nbsp;</a>And both the singers and the porters kept the ward of their God, and the ward of the purification, according
to the commandment of David,
<span class="add">and</span> of Solomon his son.
 <span class="verse"> 46</span><a name="C12V46">&nbsp;</a>For in the days of David and Asaph of old
<span class="add">there were</span> chief of the singers, and songs of praise and thanksgiving unto God.
 <span class="verse"> 47</span><a name="C12V47">&nbsp;</a>And all Israel in the days of Zerubbabel, and in the days of Nehemiah, gave the portions of the singers
and the porters, every day his portion: and they sanctified
<span class="add">holy things</span> unto the Levites; and the Levites sanctified
<span class="add">them</span> unto the children of Aaron.
