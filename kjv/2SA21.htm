 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C21V1">&nbsp;</a>Then there was a famine in the days of David three years, year after year; and David enquired of the
LORD. And the LORD answered,
<span class="add">It is
</span> for Saul, and for
<span class="add">his</span> bloody house, because he slew the Gibeonites.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C21V2">&nbsp;</a>And the king called the Gibeonites, and said unto them; (now the Gibeonites
<span class="add">were</span> not of the children of Israel, but of the remnant of the Amorites; and the children of Israel had sworn
unto them: and Saul sought to slay them in his zeal to the children of Israel and Judah.)
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C21V3">&nbsp;</a>Wherefore David said unto the Gibeonites, What shall I do for you? and wherewith shall I make the atonement,
that ye may bless the inheritance of the LORD?
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C21V4">&nbsp;</a>And the Gibeonites said unto him, We will have no silver nor gold of Saul, nor of his house; neither
for us shalt thou kill any man in Israel. And he said, What ye shall say,
<span class="add">that</span> will I do for you.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C21V5">&nbsp;</a>And they answered the king, The man that consumed us, and that devised against us
<span class="add">that</span> we should be destroyed from remaining in any of the coasts of Israel,
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C21V6">&nbsp;</a>Let seven men of his sons be delivered unto us, and we will hang them up unto the LORD in Gibeah of Saul,
<span class="add">whom</span> the LORD did choose. And the king said, I will give
<span class="add">them.
</span> <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C21V7">&nbsp;</a>But the king spared Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan the son of Saul, because of the LORD’S oath that
<span class="add">was</span> between them, between David and Jonathan the son of Saul.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C21V8">&nbsp;</a>But the king took the two sons of Rizpah the daughter of Aiah, whom she bare unto Saul, Armoni and Mephibosheth;
and the five sons of Michal the daughter of Saul, whom she brought up for Adriel the son of Barzillai
the Meholathite:
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C21V9">&nbsp;</a>And he delivered them into the hands of the Gibeonites, and they hanged them in the hill before the LORD:
and they fell
<span class="add">all</span> seven together, and were put to death in the days of harvest, in the first
<span class="add">days,
</span> in the beginning of barley harvest.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C21V10">&nbsp;</a>And Rizpah the daughter of Aiah took sackcloth, and spread it for her upon the rock, from the beginning
of harvest until water dropped upon them out of heaven, and suffered neither the birds of the air to
rest on them by day, nor the beasts of the field by night.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C21V11">&nbsp;</a>And it was told David what Rizpah the daughter of Aiah, the concubine of Saul, had done.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C21V12">&nbsp;</a>And David went and took the bones of Saul and the bones of Jonathan his son from the men of Jabesh-gilead,
which had stolen them from the street of Beth-shan, where the Philistines had hanged them, when the Philistines
had slain Saul in Gilboa:
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C21V13">&nbsp;</a>And he brought up from thence the bones of Saul and the bones of Jonathan his son; and they gathered
the bones of them that were hanged.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C21V14">&nbsp;</a>And the bones of Saul and Jonathan his son buried they in the country of Benjamin in Zelah, in the sepulchre
of Kish his father: and they performed all that the king commanded. And after that God was intreated
for the land.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C21V15">&nbsp;</a>Moreover the Philistines had yet war again with Israel; and David went down, and his servants with him,
and fought against the Philistines: and David waxed faint.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C21V16">&nbsp;</a>And Ishbi-benob, which
<span class="add">was</span> of the sons of the giant, the weight of whose spear
<span class="add">weighed</span> three hundred
<span class="add">shekels</span> of brass in weight, he being girded with a new
<span class="add">sword,</span> thought to have slain David.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C21V17">&nbsp;</a>But Abishai the son of Zeruiah succoured him, and smote the Philistine, and killed him. Then the men
of David sware unto him, saying, Thou shalt go no more out with us to battle, that thou quench not the
light of Israel.
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C21V18">&nbsp;</a>And it came to pass after this, that there was again a battle with the Philistines at Gob: then Sibbechai
the Hushathite slew Saph, which
<span class="add">was
</span> of the sons of the giant.
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C21V19">&nbsp;</a>And there was again a battle in Gob with the Philistines, where Elhanan the son of Jaare-oregim, a Bethlehemite,
slew
<span class="add">the brother of</span> Goliath the Gittite, the staff of whose spear
<span class="add">was</span> like a weaver’s beam.
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C21V20">&nbsp;</a>And there was yet a battle in Gath, where was a man of
<span class="add">great
</span> stature, that had on every hand six fingers, and on every foot six toes, four and twenty in number;
and he also was born to the giant.
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C21V21">&nbsp;</a>And when he defied Israel, Jonathan the son of Shimeah the brother of David slew him.
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C21V22">&nbsp;</a>These four were born to the giant in Gath, and fell by the hand of David, and by the hand of his servants.
