 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C5V1">&nbsp;</a>Hear ye this, O priests; and hearken, ye house of Israel; and give ye ear, O house of the king; for judgment
<span class="add">is</span> toward you, because ye have been a snare on Mizpah, and a net spread upon Tabor.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C5V2">&nbsp;</a>And the revolters are profound to make slaughter, though I
<span class="add">have been</span> a rebuker of them all.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C5V3">&nbsp;</a>I know Ephraim, and Israel is not hid from me: for now, O Ephraim, thou committest whoredom,
<span class="add">and</span> Israel is defiled.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C5V4">&nbsp;</a>They will not frame their doings to turn unto their God: for the spirit of whoredoms
<span class="add">is</span> in the midst of them, and they have not known the LORD.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C5V5">&nbsp;</a>And the pride of Israel doth testify to his face: therefore shall Israel and Ephraim fall in their iniquity;
Judah also shall fall with them.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C5V6">&nbsp;</a>They shall go with their flocks and with their herds to seek the LORD; but they shall not find
<span class="add">him;</span> he hath withdrawn himself from them.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C5V7">&nbsp;</a>They have dealt treacherously against the LORD: for they have begotten strange children: now shall a
month devour them with their portions.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C5V8">&nbsp;</a>Blow ye the cornet in Gibeah,
<span class="add">and</span> the trumpet in Ramah: cry aloud
<span class="add">at</span> Beth-aven, after thee, O Benjamin.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C5V9">&nbsp;</a>Ephraim shall be desolate in the day of rebuke: among the tribes of Israel have I made known that which
shall surely be.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C5V10">&nbsp;</a>The princes of Judah were like them that remove the bound:
<span class="add">therefore</span> I will pour out my wrath upon them like water.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C5V11">&nbsp;</a>Ephraim
<span class="add">is</span> oppressed
<span class="add">and</span> broken in judgment, because he willingly walked after the commandment.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C5V12">&nbsp;</a>Therefore
<span class="add">will</span> I
<span class="add">be</span> unto Ephraim as a moth, and to the house of Judah as rottenness.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C5V13">&nbsp;</a>When Ephraim saw his sickness, and Judah
<span class="add">saw</span> his wound, then went Ephraim to the Assyrian, and sent to king Jareb: yet could he not heal you, nor
cure you of your wound.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C5V14">&nbsp;</a>For I will
<span class="add">be</span> unto Ephraim as a lion, and as a young lion to the house of Judah: I,
<span class="add">even</span> I, will tear and go away; I will take away, and none shall rescue
<span class="add">him.</span></div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C5V15">&nbsp;</a>I will go
<span class="add">and</span> return to my place, till they acknowledge their offence, and seek my face: in their affliction they
will seek me early.
