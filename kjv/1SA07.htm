 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C7V1">&nbsp;</a>And the men of Kirjath-jearim came, and brought up the ark of the LORD, and brought it into the house
of Abinadab in the hill, and sanctified Eleazar his son to keep the ark of the LORD.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C7V2">&nbsp;</a>And it came to pass, while the ark abode in Kirjath-jearim, that the time was long; for it was twenty
years: and all the house of Israel lamented after the LORD.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C7V3">&nbsp;</a>And Samuel spake unto all the house of Israel, saying, If ye do return unto the LORD with all your hearts,
<span class="add">then</span> put away the strange gods and Ashtaroth from among you, and prepare your hearts unto the LORD, and serve
him only: and he will deliver you out of the hand of the Philistines.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C7V4">&nbsp;</a>Then the children of Israel did put away Baalim and Ashtaroth, and served the LORD only.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C7V5">&nbsp;</a>And Samuel said, Gather all Israel to Mizpeh, and I will pray for you unto the LORD.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C7V6">&nbsp;</a>And they gathered together to Mizpeh, and drew water, and poured
<span class="add">it</span> out before the LORD, and fasted on that day, and said there, We have sinned against the LORD. And Samuel
judged the children of Israel in Mizpeh.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C7V7">&nbsp;</a>And when the Philistines heard that the children of Israel were gathered together to Mizpeh, the lords
of the Philistines went up against Israel. And when the children of Israel heard
<span class="add">it,</span> they were afraid of the Philistines.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C7V8">&nbsp;</a>And the children of Israel said to Samuel, Cease not to cry unto the LORD our God for us, that he will
save us out of the hand of the Philistines.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C7V9">&nbsp;</a>And Samuel took a sucking lamb, and offered
<span class="add">it for</span> a burnt offering wholly unto the LORD: and Samuel cried unto the LORD for Israel; and the LORD heard
him.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C7V10">&nbsp;</a>And as Samuel was offering up the burnt offering, the Philistines drew near to battle against Israel:
but the LORD thundered with a great thunder on that day upon the Philistines, and discomfited them; and
they were smitten before Israel.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C7V11">&nbsp;</a>And the men of Israel went out of Mizpeh, and pursued the Philistines, and smote them, until
<span class="add">they came</span> under Beth-car.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C7V12">&nbsp;</a>Then Samuel took a stone, and set
<span class="add">it</span> between Mizpeh and Shen, and called the name of it Eben-ezer, saying, Hitherto hath the LORD helped
us.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C7V13">&nbsp;</a>So the Philistines were subdued, and they came no more into the coast of Israel: and the hand of the
LORD was against the Philistines all the days of Samuel.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C7V14">&nbsp;</a>And the cities which the Philistines had taken from Israel were restored to Israel, from Ekron even unto
Gath; and the coasts thereof did Israel deliver out of the hands of the Philistines. And there was peace
between Israel and the Amorites.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C7V15">&nbsp;</a>And Samuel judged Israel all the days of his life.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C7V16">&nbsp;</a>And he went from year to year in circuit to Bethel, and Gilgal, and Mizpeh, and judged Israel in all
those places.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C7V17">&nbsp;</a>And his return
<span class="add">was</span> to Ramah; for there
<span class="add">was</span> his house; and there he judged Israel; and there he built an altar unto the LORD.
