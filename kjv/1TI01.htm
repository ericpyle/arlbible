<div class="mt1">The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy
</div>
<div class="chapterlabel"> 1</div><div class="p">
 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C1V1">&nbsp;</a>Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the commandment of God our Saviour, and Lord Jesus Christ,
<span class="add">which is</span> our hope;
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C1V2">&nbsp;</a>Unto Timothy,
<span class="add">my</span> own son in the faith: Grace, mercy,
<span class="add">and</span> peace, from God our Father and Jesus Christ our Lord.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C1V3">&nbsp;</a>As I besought thee to abide still at Ephesus, when I went into Macedonia, that thou mightest charge some
that they teach no other doctrine,
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C1V4">&nbsp;</a>Neither give heed to fables and endless genealogies, which minister questions, rather than godly edifying
which is in faith:
<span class="add">so do.
</span> <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C1V5">&nbsp;</a>Now the end of the commandment is charity out of a pure heart, and
<span class="add">of</span> a good conscience, and
<span class="add">of</span> faith unfeigned:
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C1V6">&nbsp;</a>From which some having swerved have turned aside unto vain jangling;
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C1V7">&nbsp;</a>Desiring to be teachers of the law; understanding neither what they say, nor whereof they affirm.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C1V8">&nbsp;</a>But we know that the law
<span class="add">is</span> good, if a man use it lawfully;
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C1V9">&nbsp;</a>Knowing this, that the law is not made for a righteous man, but for the lawless and disobedient, for
the ungodly and for sinners, for unholy and profane, for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers,
for manslayers,
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C1V10">&nbsp;</a>For whoremongers, for them that defile themselves with mankind, for menstealers, for liars, for perjured
persons, and if there be any other thing that is contrary to sound doctrine;
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C1V11">&nbsp;</a>According to the glorious gospel of the blessed God, which was committed to my trust.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C1V12">&nbsp;</a>And I thank Christ Jesus our Lord, who hath enabled me, for that he counted me faithful, putting me into
the ministry;
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C1V13">&nbsp;</a>Who was before a blasphemer, and a persecutor, and injurious: but I obtained mercy, because I did
<span class="add">it</span> ignorantly in unbelief.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C1V14">&nbsp;</a>And the grace of our Lord was exceeding abundant with faith and love which is in Christ Jesus.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C1V15">&nbsp;</a>This
<span class="add">is</span> a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners;
of whom I am chief.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C1V16">&nbsp;</a>Howbeit for this cause I obtained mercy, that in me first Jesus Christ might shew forth all longsuffering,
for a pattern to them which should hereafter believe on him to life everlasting.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C1V17">&nbsp;</a>Now unto the King eternal, immortal, invisible, the only wise God,
<span class="add">be</span> honour and glory for ever and ever. Amen.
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C1V18">&nbsp;</a>This charge I commit unto thee, son Timothy, according to the prophecies which went before on thee, that
thou by them mightest war a good warfare;
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C1V19">&nbsp;</a>Holding faith, and a good conscience; which some having put away concerning faith have made shipwreck:
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C1V20">&nbsp;</a>Of whom is Hymenaeus and Alexander; whom I have delivered unto Satan, that they may learn not to blaspheme.
