<div class="chapterlabel"> 3</div><div class="p">
 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C3V1">&nbsp;</a>Now when Darius reigned, he made a great feast unto all his subjects, and unto all his household, and
unto all the princes of Media and Persia,
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C3V2">&nbsp;</a>And to all the governors and captains and lieutenants that were under him, from India unto Ethiopia,
of an hundred twenty and seven provinces.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C3V3">&nbsp;</a>And when they had eaten and drunken, and being satisfied were gone home, then Darius the king went into
his bedchamber, and slept, and soon after awaked.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C3V4">&nbsp;</a>Then three young men, that were of the guard that kept the king’s body, spake one to another;
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C3V5">&nbsp;</a>Let every one of us speak a sentence: he that shall overcome, and whose sentence shall seem wiser than
the others, unto him shall the king Darius give great gifts, and great things in token of victory:
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C3V6">&nbsp;</a>As, to be clothed in purple, to drink in gold, and to sleep upon gold, and a chariot with bridles of
gold, and an headtire of fine linen, and a chain about his neck:
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C3V7">&nbsp;</a>And he shall sit next to Darius because of his wisdom, and shall be called Darius his cousin.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C3V8">&nbsp;</a>And then every one wrote his sentence, sealed it, and laid it under king Darius his pillow;
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C3V9">&nbsp;</a>And said that, when the king is risen, some will give him the writings; and of whose side the king and
the three princes of Persia shall judge that his sentence is the wisest, to him shall the victory be
given, as was appointed.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C3V10">&nbsp;</a>The first wrote, Wine is the strongest.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C3V11">&nbsp;</a>The second wrote, The king is strongest.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C3V12">&nbsp;</a>The third wrote, Women are strongest: but above all things Truth beareth away the victory.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C3V13">&nbsp;</a>Now when the king was risen up, they took their writings, and delivered them unto him, and so he read
them:
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C3V14">&nbsp;</a>And sending forth he called all the princes of Persia and Media, and the governors, and the captains,
and the lieutenants, and the chief officers;
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C3V15">&nbsp;</a>And sat him down in the royal seat of judgment; and the writings were read before them.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C3V16">&nbsp;</a>And he said, Call the young men, and they shall declare their own sentences. So they were called, and
came in.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C3V17">&nbsp;</a>And he said unto them, Declare unto us your mind concerning the writings. Then began the first, who had
spoken of the strength of wine;
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C3V18">&nbsp;</a>And he said thus, O ye men, how exceeding strong is wine! it causeth all men to err that drink it:
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C3V19">&nbsp;</a>It maketh the mind of the king and of the fatherless child to be all one; of the bondman and of the freeman,
of the poor man and of the rich:
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C3V20">&nbsp;</a>It turneth also every thought into jollity and mirth, so that a man remembereth neither sorrow nor debt:
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C3V21">&nbsp;</a>And it maketh every heart rich, so that a man remembereth neither king nor governor; and it maketh to
speak all things by talents:
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C3V22">&nbsp;</a>And when they are in their cups, they forget their love both to friends and brethren, and a little after
draw out swords:
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C3V23">&nbsp;</a>But when they are from the wine, they remember not what they have done.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C3V24">&nbsp;</a>O ye men, is not wine the strongest, that enforceth to do thus? And when he had so spoken, he held his
peace.
