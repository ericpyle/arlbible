 <span class="verse" id="V1">1&nbsp;</span>Doth not wisdom cry? and understanding put forth her voice?  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span>She standeth in the top of high places, by the way in the places of the paths.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>She crieth at the gates, at the entry of the city, at the coming in at the doors.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>Unto you, O men, I call; and my voice <span class='add'>is</span> to the sons of man.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>O ye simple, understand wisdom: and, ye fools, be ye of an understanding heart.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>Hear; for I will speak of excellent things; and the opening of my lips <span class='add'>shall be</span> right things.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>For my mouth shall speak truth; and wickedness <span class='add'>is</span> an abomination to my lips.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>All the words of my mouth <span class='add'>are</span> in righteousness; <span class='add'>there is</span> nothing froward or perverse in them.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>They <span class='add'>are</span> all plain to him that understandeth, and right to them that find knowledge.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>Receive my instruction, and not silver; and knowledge rather than choice gold.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>For wisdom <span class='add'>is</span> better than rubies; and all the things that may be desired are not to be compared to it.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>I wisdom dwell with prudence, and find out knowledge of witty inventions.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>The fear of the LORD <span class='add'>is</span> to hate evil: pride, and arrogancy, and the evil way, and the froward mouth, do I hate.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>Counsel <span class='add'>is</span> mine, and sound wisdom: I <span class='add'>am</span> understanding; I have strength.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>By me kings reign, and princes decree justice.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>By me princes rule, and nobles, <span class='add'>even</span> all the judges of the earth.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>I love them that love me; and those that seek me early shall find me.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>Riches and honour <span class='add'>are</span> with me; <span class='add'>yea</span>, durable riches and righteousness.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>My fruit <span class='add'>is</span> better than gold, yea, than fine gold; and my revenue than choice silver.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>I lead in the way of righteousness, in the midst of the paths of judgment:  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>That I may cause those that love me to inherit substance; and I will fill their treasures.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>The LORD possessed me in the beginning of his way, before his works of old.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>I was set up from everlasting, from the beginning, or ever the earth was.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>When <span class='add'>there were</span> no depths, I was brought forth; when <span class='add'>there were</span> no fountains abounding with water.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>Before the mountains were settled, before the hills was I brought forth:  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>While as yet he had not made the earth, nor the fields, nor the highest part of the dust of the world.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>When he prepared the heavens, I <span class='add'>was</span> there: when he set a compass upon the face of the depth:  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&nbsp;</span>When he established the clouds above: when he strengthened the fountains of the deep:  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&nbsp;</span>When he gave to the sea his decree, that the waters should not pass his commandment: when he appointed the foundations of the earth:  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&nbsp;</span>Then I was by him, <span class='add'>as</span> one brought up <span class='add'>with him:</span> and I was daily <span class='add'>his</span> delight, rejoicing always before him;  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&nbsp;</span>Rejoicing in the habitable part of his earth; and my delights <span class='add'>were</span> with the sons of men.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&nbsp;</span>Now therefore hearken unto me, O ye children: for blessed <span class='add'>are they that</span> keep my ways.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&nbsp;</span>Hear instruction, and be wise, and refuse it not.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&nbsp;</span>Blessed <span class='add'>is</span> the man that heareth me, watching daily at my gates, waiting at the posts of my doors.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&nbsp;</span>For whoso findeth me findeth life, and shall obtain favour of the LORD.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&nbsp;</span>But he that sinneth against me wrongeth his own soul: all they that hate me love death. </div><ul class='tnav'>
