 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C10V1">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that entereth not by the door into the sheepfold, but climbeth up
some other way, the same is a thief and a robber.
</span> <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C10V2">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">But he that entereth in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep.
</span> <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C10V3">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">To him the porter openeth; and the sheep hear his voice: and he calleth his own sheep by name, and leadeth
them out.
</span> <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C10V4">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And when he putteth forth his own sheep, he goeth before them, and the sheep follow him: for they know
his voice.
</span> <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C10V5">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And a stranger will they not follow, but will flee from him: for they know not the voice of strangers.
</span> <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C10V6">&nbsp;</a>This parable spake Jesus unto them: but they understood not what things they were which he spake unto
them.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C10V7">&nbsp;</a>Then said Jesus unto them again,
<span class="wj">Verily, verily, I say unto you, I am the door of the sheep.
</span> <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C10V8">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">All that ever came before me are thieves and robbers: but the sheep did not hear them.
</span> <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C10V9">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">I am the door: by me if any man enter in, he shall be saved, and shall go in and out, and find pasture.
</span> <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C10V10">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">The thief cometh not, but for to steal, and to kill, and to destroy: I am come that they might have life,
and that they might have
it more abundantly.
</span> <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C10V11">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">I am the good shepherd: the good shepherd giveth his life for the sheep.
</span> <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C10V12">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">But he that is an hireling, and not the shepherd, whose own the sheep are not, seeth the wolf coming,
and leaveth the sheep, and fleeth: and the wolf catcheth them, and scattereth the sheep.
</span> <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C10V13">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">The hireling fleeth, because he is an hireling, and careth not for the sheep.
</span> <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C10V14">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">I am the good shepherd, and know my
sheep, and am known of mine.
</span> <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C10V15">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">As the Father knoweth me, even so know I the Father: and I lay down my life for the sheep.
</span> <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C10V16">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And other sheep I have, which are not of this fold: them also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice;
and there shall be one fold,
and one shepherd.
</span> <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C10V17">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Therefore doth my Father love me, because I lay down my life, that I might take it again.
</span> <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C10V18">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">No man taketh it from me, but I lay it down of myself. I have power to lay it down, and I have power
to take it again. This commandment have I received of my Father.</span></div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C10V19">&nbsp;</a>There was a division therefore again among the Jews for these sayings.
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C10V20">&nbsp;</a>And many of them said, He hath a devil, and is mad; why hear ye him?
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C10V21">&nbsp;</a>Others said, These are not the words of him that hath a devil. Can a devil open the eyes of the blind?
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C10V22">&nbsp;</a>And it was at Jerusalem the feast of the dedication, and it was winter.
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C10V23">&nbsp;</a>And Jesus walked in the temple in Solomon’s porch.
 <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C10V24">&nbsp;</a>Then came the Jews round about him, and said unto him, How long dost thou make us to doubt? If thou be
the Christ, tell us plainly.
 <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C10V25">&nbsp;</a>Jesus answered them,
<span class="wj">I told you, and ye believed not: the works that I do in my Father’s name, they bear witness of me.
</span> <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C10V26">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">But ye believe not, because ye are not of my sheep, as I said unto you.
</span> <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C10V27">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me:
</span> <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C10V28">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish, neither shall any
man pluck them out of my hand.
</span> <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C10V29">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">My Father, which gave
them me, is greater than all; and no
man is able to pluck
them out of my Father’s hand.
</span> <span class="verse"> 30</span><a name="C10V30">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">I and
my Father are one.
</span> <span class="verse"> 31</span><a name="C10V31">&nbsp;</a>Then the Jews took up stones again to stone him.
 <span class="verse"> 32</span><a name="C10V32">&nbsp;</a>Jesus answered them,
<span class="wj">Many good works have I shewed you from my Father; for which of those works do ye stone me?
</span> <span class="verse"> 33</span><a name="C10V33">&nbsp;</a>The Jews answered him, saying, For a good work we stone thee not; but for blasphemy; and because that
thou, being a man, makest thyself God.
 <span class="verse"> 34</span><a name="C10V34">&nbsp;</a>Jesus answered them,
<span class="wj">Is it not written in your law, I said, Ye are gods?
</span> <span class="verse"> 35</span><a name="C10V35">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">If he called them gods, unto whom the word of God came, and the scripture cannot be broken;
</span> <span class="verse"> 36</span><a name="C10V36">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Say ye of him, whom the Father hath sanctified, and sent into the world, Thou blasphemest; because I
said, I am the Son of God?
</span> <span class="verse"> 37</span><a name="C10V37">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">If I do not the works of my Father, believe me not.
</span> <span class="verse"> 38</span><a name="C10V38">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">But if I do, though ye believe not me, believe the works: that ye may know, and believe, that the Father
is in me, and I in him.
</span> <span class="verse"> 39</span><a name="C10V39">&nbsp;</a>Therefore they sought again to take him: but he escaped out of their hand,
 <span class="verse"> 40</span><a name="C10V40">&nbsp;</a>And went away again beyond Jordan into the place where John at first baptized; and there he abode.
 <span class="verse"> 41</span><a name="C10V41">&nbsp;</a>And many resorted unto him, and said, John did no miracle: but all things that John spake of this man
were true.
 <span class="verse"> 42</span><a name="C10V42">&nbsp;</a>And many believed on him there.
