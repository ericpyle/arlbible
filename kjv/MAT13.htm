 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C13V1">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">The same day went Jesus out of the house, and sat by the sea side.
</span> <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C13V2">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And great multitudes were gathered together unto him, so that he went into a ship, and sat; and the whole
multitude stood on the shore.
</span> <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C13V3">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And he spake many things unto them in parables, saying, Behold, a sower went forth to sow;
</span> <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C13V4">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And when he sowed, some
</span><span class="add">seeds</span><span class="wj"> fell by the way side, and the fowls came and devoured them up:
</span> <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C13V5">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Some fell upon stony places, where they had not much earth: and forthwith they sprung up, because they
had no deepness of earth:
</span> <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C13V6">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And when the sun was up, they were scorched; and because they had no root, they withered away.
</span> <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C13V7">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And some fell among thorns; and the thorns sprung up, and choked them:
</span> <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C13V8">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">But other fell into good ground, and brought forth fruit, some an hundredfold, some sixtyfold, some thirtyfold.
</span> <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C13V9">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Who hath ears to hear, let him hear.
</span> <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C13V10">&nbsp;</a>And the disciples came, and said unto him, Why speakest thou unto them in parables?
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C13V11">&nbsp;</a>He answered and said unto them,
<span class="wj">Because it is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it is not given.
</span> <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C13V12">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">For whosoever hath, to him shall be given, and he shall have more abundance: but whosoever hath not,
from him shall be taken away even that he hath.
</span> <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C13V13">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Therefore speak I to them in parables: because they seeing see not; and hearing they hear not, neither
do they understand.
</span> <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C13V14">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And in them is fulfilled the prophecy of Esaias, which saith, By hearing ye shall hear, and shall not
understand; and seeing ye shall see, and shall not perceive:
</span> <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C13V15">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">For this people’s heart is waxed gross, and
</span><span class="add">their</span><span class="wj"> ears are dull of hearing, and their eyes they have closed; lest at any time they should see with
</span><span class="add">their</span><span class="wj"> eyes, and hear with
</span><span class="add">their</span><span class="wj"> ears, and should understand with
</span><span class="add">their
</span><span class="wj"> heart, and should be converted, and I should heal them.
</span> <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C13V16">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">But blessed
</span><span class="add">are</span><span class="wj"> your eyes, for they see: and your ears, for they hear.
</span> <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C13V17">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">For verily I say unto you, That many prophets and righteous
</span><span class="add">men</span><span class="wj"> have desired to see
</span><span class="add">those things</span><span class="wj"> which ye see, and have not seen
</span><span class="add">them;</span><span class="wj"> and to hear
</span><span class="add">those things</span><span class="wj"> which ye hear, and have not heard
</span><span class="add">them.</span></div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C13V18">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Hear ye therefore the parable of the sower.
</span> <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C13V19">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">When any one heareth the word of the kingdom, and understandeth
</span><span class="add">it</span><span class="wj"> not, then cometh the wicked
</span><span class="add">one,</span><span class="wj"> and catcheth away that which was sown in his heart. This is he which received seed by the way side.
</span> <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C13V20">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">But he that received the seed into stony places, the same is he that heareth the word, and anon with
joy receiveth it;
</span> <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C13V21">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Yet hath he not root in himself, but dureth for a while: for when tribulation or persecution ariseth
because of the word, by and by he is offended.
</span> <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C13V22">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">He also that received seed among the thorns is he that heareth the word; and the care of this world,
and the deceitfulness of riches, choke the word, and he becometh unfruitful.
</span> <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C13V23">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">But he that received seed into the good ground is he that heareth the word, and understandeth
</span><span class="add">it;</span><span class="wj"> which also beareth fruit, and bringeth forth, some an hundredfold, some sixty, some thirty.</span></div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C13V24">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Another parable put he forth unto them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is likened unto a man which sowed
good seed in his field:
</span> <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C13V25">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">But while men slept, his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat, and went his way.
</span> <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C13V26">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">But when the blade was sprung up, and brought forth fruit, then appeared the tares also.
</span> <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C13V27">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">So the servants of the householder came and said unto him, Sir, didst not thou sow good seed in thy field?
from whence then hath it tares?
</span> <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C13V28">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">He said unto them, An enemy hath done this. The servants said unto him, Wilt thou then that we go and
gather them up?
</span> <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C13V29">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">But he said, Nay; lest while ye gather up the tares, ye root up also the wheat with them.
</span> <span class="verse"> 30</span><a name="C13V30">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Let both grow together until the harvest: and in the time of harvest I will say to the reapers, Gather
ye together first the tares, and bind them in bundles to burn them: but gather the wheat into my barn.</span></div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 31</span><a name="C13V31">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Another parable put he forth unto them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is like to a grain of mustard seed,
which a man took, and sowed in his field:
</span> <span class="verse"> 32</span><a name="C13V32">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Which indeed is the least of all seeds: but when it is grown, it is the greatest among herbs, and becometh
a tree, so that the birds of the air come and lodge in the branches thereof.</span></div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 33</span><a name="C13V33">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Another parable spake he unto them; The kingdom of heaven is like unto leaven, which a woman took, and
hid in three measures of meal, till the whole was leavened.
</span> <span class="verse"> 34</span><a name="C13V34">&nbsp;</a>All these things spake Jesus unto the multitude in parables; and without a parable spake he not unto
them:
 <span class="verse"> 35</span><a name="C13V35">&nbsp;</a>That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying, I will open my mouth in parables;
I will utter things which have been kept secret from the foundation of the world.
 <span class="verse"> 36</span><a name="C13V36">&nbsp;</a>Then Jesus sent the multitude away, and went into the house: and his disciples came unto him, saying,
Declare unto us the parable of the tares of the field.
 <span class="verse"> 37</span><a name="C13V37">&nbsp;</a>He answered and said unto them,
<span class="wj">He that soweth the good seed is the Son of man;
</span> <span class="verse"> 38</span><a name="C13V38">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">The field is the world; the good seed are the children of the kingdom; but the tares are the children
of the wicked
</span><span class="add">one;
</span> <span class="verse"> 39</span><a name="C13V39">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">The enemy that sowed them is the devil; the harvest is the end of the world; and the reapers are the
angels.
</span> <span class="verse"> 40</span><a name="C13V40">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">As therefore the tares are gathered and burned in the fire; so shall it be in the end of this world.
</span> <span class="verse"> 41</span><a name="C13V41">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">The Son of man shall send forth his angels, and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that
offend, and them which do iniquity;
</span> <span class="verse"> 42</span><a name="C13V42">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And shall cast them into a furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.
</span> <span class="verse"> 43</span><a name="C13V43">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father. Who hath ears to hear,
let him hear.</span></div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 44</span><a name="C13V44">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto treasure hid in a field; the which when a man hath found, he
hideth, and for joy thereof goeth and selleth all that he hath, and buyeth that field.</span></div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 45</span><a name="C13V45">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a merchant man, seeking goodly pearls:
</span> <span class="verse"> 46</span><a name="C13V46">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Who, when he had found one pearl of great price, went and sold all that he had, and bought it.</span></div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 47</span><a name="C13V47">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a net, that was cast into the sea, and gathered of every kind:
</span> <span class="verse"> 48</span><a name="C13V48">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Which, when it was full, they drew to shore, and sat down, and gathered the good into vessels, but cast
the bad away.
</span> <span class="verse"> 49</span><a name="C13V49">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">So shall it be at the end of the world: the angels shall come forth, and sever the wicked from among
the just,
</span> <span class="verse"> 50</span><a name="C13V50">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And shall cast them into the furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.
</span> <span class="verse"> 51</span><a name="C13V51">&nbsp;</a>Jesus saith unto them,
<span class="wj">Have ye understood all these things?
</span> They say unto him, Yea, Lord.
 <span class="verse"> 52</span><a name="C13V52">&nbsp;</a>Then said he unto them,
<span class="wj">Therefore every scribe
</span><span class="add">which is
</span><span class="wj"> instructed unto the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man
</span><span class="add">that is</span><span class="wj"> an householder, which bringeth forth out of his treasure
</span><span class="add">things</span><span class="wj"> new and old.</span></div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 53</span><a name="C13V53">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And it came to pass,
</span><span class="add">that</span><span class="wj"> when Jesus had finished these parables, he departed thence.
</span> <span class="verse"> 54</span><a name="C13V54">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And when he was come into his own country, he taught them in their synagogue, insomuch that they were
astonished, and said, Whence hath this
</span><span class="add">man</span><span class="wj"> this wisdom, and
</span><span class="add">these</span><span class="wj"> mighty works?
</span> <span class="verse"> 55</span><a name="C13V55">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Is not this the carpenter’s son? is not his mother called Mary? and his brethren, James, and Joses, and
Simon, and Judas?
</span> <span class="verse"> 56</span><a name="C13V56">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And his sisters, are they not all with us? Whence then hath this
</span><span class="add">man</span><span class="wj"> all these things?
</span> <span class="verse"> 57</span><a name="C13V57">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And they were offended in him. But Jesus said unto them, A prophet is not without honour, save in his
own country, and in his own house.
</span> <span class="verse"> 58</span><a name="C13V58">&nbsp;</a>And he did not many mighty works there because of their unbelief.
