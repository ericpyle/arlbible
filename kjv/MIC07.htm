 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C7V1">&nbsp;</a>Woe is me! for I am as when they have gathered the summer fruits, as the grapegleanings of the vintage:
<span class="add">there is</span> no cluster to eat: my soul desired the firstripe fruit.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C7V2">&nbsp;</a>The good
<span class="add">man</span> is perished out of the earth: and
<span class="add">there is</span> none upright among men: they all lie in wait for blood; they hunt every man his brother with a net.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C7V3">&nbsp;</a>That they may do evil with both hands earnestly, the prince asketh, and the judge
<span class="add">asketh</span> for a reward; and the great
<span class="add">man,</span> he uttereth his mischievous desire: so they wrap it up.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C7V4">&nbsp;</a>The best of them
<span class="add">is</span> as a brier: the most upright
<span class="add">is sharper</span> than a thorn hedge: the day of thy watchmen
<span class="add">and</span> thy visitation cometh; now shall be their perplexity.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C7V5">&nbsp;</a>Trust ye not in a friend, put ye not confidence in a guide: keep the doors of thy mouth from her that
lieth in thy bosom.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C7V6">&nbsp;</a>For the son dishonoureth the father, the daughter riseth up against her mother, the daughter in law against
her mother in law; a man’s enemies
<span class="add">are</span> the men of his own house.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C7V7">&nbsp;</a>Therefore I will look unto the LORD; I will wait for the God of my salvation: my God will hear me.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C7V8">&nbsp;</a>Rejoice not against me, O mine enemy: when I fall, I shall arise; when I sit in darkness, the LORD
<span class="add">shall be</span> a light unto me.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C7V9">&nbsp;</a>I will bear the indignation of the LORD, because I have sinned against him, until he plead my cause,
and execute judgment for me: he will bring me forth to the light,
<span class="add">and</span> I shall behold his righteousness.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C7V10">&nbsp;</a>Then
<span class="add">she that is</span> mine enemy shall see
<span class="add">it,</span> and shame shall cover her which said unto me, Where is the LORD thy God? mine eyes shall behold her:
now shall she be trodden down as the mire of the streets.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C7V11">&nbsp;</a><span class="add">In</span> the day that thy walls are to be built,
<span class="add">in</span> that day shall the decree be far removed.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C7V12">&nbsp;</a><span class="add">In</span> that day
<span class="add">also</span> he shall come even to thee from Assyria, and
<span class="add">from</span> the fortified cities, and from the fortress even to the river, and from sea to sea, and
<span class="add">from</span> mountain to mountain.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C7V13">&nbsp;</a>Notwithstanding the land shall be desolate because of them that dwell therein, for the fruit of their
doings.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C7V14">&nbsp;</a>Feed thy people with thy rod, the flock of thine heritage, which dwell solitarily
<span class="add">in</span> the wood, in the midst of Carmel: let them feed
<span class="add">in</span> Bashan and Gilead, as in the days of old.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C7V15">&nbsp;</a>According to the days of thy coming out of the land of Egypt will I shew unto him marvellous
<span class="add">things.</span></div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C7V16">&nbsp;</a>The nations shall see and be confounded at all their might: they shall lay
<span class="add">their</span> hand upon
<span class="add">their</span> mouth, their ears shall be deaf.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C7V17">&nbsp;</a>They shall lick the dust like a serpent, they shall move out of their holes like worms of the earth:
they shall be afraid of the LORD our God, and shall fear because of thee.
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C7V18">&nbsp;</a>Who
<span class="add">is</span> a God like unto thee, that pardoneth iniquity, and passeth by the transgression of the remnant of his
heritage? he retaineth not his anger for ever, because he delighteth
<span class="add">in</span> mercy.
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C7V19">&nbsp;</a>He will turn again, he will have compassion upon us; he will subdue our iniquities; and thou wilt cast
all their sins into the depths of the sea.
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C7V20">&nbsp;</a>Thou wilt perform the truth to Jacob,
<span class="add">and</span> the mercy to Abraham, which thou hast sworn unto our fathers from the days of old.
