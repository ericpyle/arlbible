<div class="chapterlabel"> 6</div><div class="p">
 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C6V1">&nbsp;</a>Hear therefore, O ye kings, and understand; learn, ye that be judges of the ends of the earth.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C6V2">&nbsp;</a>Give ear, ye that rule the people, and glory in the multitude of nations.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C6V3">&nbsp;</a>For power is given you of the Lord, and sovereignty from the Highest, who shall try your works, and search
out your counsels.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C6V4">&nbsp;</a>Because, being ministers of his kingdom, ye have not judged aright, nor kept the law, nor walked after
the counsel of God;
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C6V5">&nbsp;</a>Horribly and speedily shall he come upon you: for a sharp judgment shall be to them that be in high places.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C6V6">&nbsp;</a>For mercy will soon pardon the meanest: but mighty men shall be mightily tormented.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C6V7">&nbsp;</a>For he which is Lord over all shall fear no man’s person, neither shall he stand in awe of any man’s
greatness: for he hath made the small and great, and careth for all alike.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C6V8">&nbsp;</a>But a sore trial shall come upon the mighty.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C6V9">&nbsp;</a>Unto you therefore, O kings, do I speak, that ye may learn wisdom, and not fall away.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C6V10">&nbsp;</a>For they that keep holiness holily shall be judged holy: and they that have learned such things shall
find what to answer.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C6V11">&nbsp;</a>Wherefore set your affection upon my words; desire them, and ye shall be instructed.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C6V12">&nbsp;</a>Wisdom is glorious, and never fadeth away: yea, she is easily seen of them that love her, and found of
such as seek her.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C6V13">&nbsp;</a>She preventeth them that desire her, in making herself first known unto them.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C6V14">&nbsp;</a>Whoso seeketh her early shall have no great travail: for he shall find her sitting at his doors.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C6V15">&nbsp;</a>To think therefore upon her is perfection of wisdom: and whoso watcheth for her shall quickly be without
care.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C6V16">&nbsp;</a>For she goeth about seeking such as are worthy of her, sheweth herself favourably unto them in the ways,
and meeteth them in every thought.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C6V17">&nbsp;</a>For the very true beginning of her is the desire of discipline; and the care of discipline is love;
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C6V18">&nbsp;</a>And love is the keeping of her laws; and the giving heed unto her laws is the assurance of incorruption;
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C6V19">&nbsp;</a>And incorruption maketh us near unto God:
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C6V20">&nbsp;</a>Therefore the desire of wisdom bringeth to a kingdom.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C6V21">&nbsp;</a>If your delight be then in thrones and sceptres, O ye kings of the people, honour wisdom, that ye may
reign for evermore.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C6V22">&nbsp;</a>As for wisdom, what she is, and how she came up, I will tell you, and will not hide mysteries from you:
but will seek her out from the beginning of her nativity, and bring the knowledge of her into light,
and will not pass over the truth.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C6V23">&nbsp;</a>Neither will I go with consuming envy; for such a man shall have no fellowship with wisdom.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C6V24">&nbsp;</a>But the multitude of the wise is the welfare of the world: and a wise king is the upholding of the people.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C6V25">&nbsp;</a>Receive therefore instruction through my words, and it shall do you good.
