 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C2V1">&nbsp;</a>My brethren, have not the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ,
<span class="add">the Lord</span> of glory, with respect of persons.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C2V2">&nbsp;</a>For if there come unto your assembly a man with a gold ring, in goodly apparel, and there come in also
a poor man in vile raiment;
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C2V3">&nbsp;</a>And ye have respect to him that weareth the gay clothing, and say unto him, Sit thou here in a good place;
and say to the poor, Stand thou there, or sit here under my footstool:
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C2V4">&nbsp;</a>Are ye not then partial in yourselves, and are become judges of evil thoughts?
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C2V5">&nbsp;</a>Hearken, my beloved brethren, Hath not God chosen the poor of this world rich in faith, and heirs of
the kingdom which he hath promised to them that love him?
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C2V6">&nbsp;</a>But ye have despised the poor. Do not rich men oppress you, and draw you before the judgment seats?
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C2V7">&nbsp;</a>Do not they blaspheme that worthy name by the which ye are called?
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C2V8">&nbsp;</a>If ye fulfil the royal law according to the scripture, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself, ye do
well:
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C2V9">&nbsp;</a>But if ye have respect to persons, ye commit sin, and are convinced of the law as transgressors.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C2V10">&nbsp;</a>For whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one
<span class="add">point,</span> he is guilty of all.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C2V11">&nbsp;</a>For he that said, Do not commit adultery, said also, Do not kill. Now if thou commit no adultery, yet
if thou kill, thou art become a transgressor of the law.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C2V12">&nbsp;</a>So speak ye, and so do, as they that shall be judged by the law of liberty.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C2V13">&nbsp;</a>For he shall have judgment without mercy, that hath shewed no mercy; and mercy rejoiceth against judgment.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C2V14">&nbsp;</a>What
<span class="add">doth it</span> profit, my brethren, though a man say he hath faith, and have not works? can faith save him?
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C2V15">&nbsp;</a>If a brother or sister be naked, and destitute of daily food,
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C2V16">&nbsp;</a>And one of you say unto them, Depart in peace, be ye warmed and filled; notwithstanding ye give them
not those things which are needful to the body; what
<span class="add">doth it</span> profit?
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C2V17">&nbsp;</a>Even so faith, if it hath not works, is dead, being alone.
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C2V18">&nbsp;</a>Yea, a man may say, Thou hast faith, and I have works: shew me thy faith without thy works, and I will
shew thee my faith by my works.
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C2V19">&nbsp;</a>Thou believest that there is one God; thou doest well: the devils also believe, and tremble.
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C2V20">&nbsp;</a>But wilt thou know, O vain man, that faith without works is dead?
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C2V21">&nbsp;</a>Was not Abraham our father justified by works, when he had offered Isaac his son upon the altar?
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C2V22">&nbsp;</a>Seest thou how faith wrought with his works, and by works was faith made perfect?
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C2V23">&nbsp;</a>And the scripture was fulfilled which saith, Abraham believed God, and it was imputed unto him for righteousness:
and he was called the Friend of God.
 <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C2V24">&nbsp;</a>Ye see then how that by works a man is justified, and not by faith only.
 <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C2V25">&nbsp;</a>Likewise also was not Rahab the harlot justified by works, when she had received the messengers, and
had sent
<span class="add">them</span> out another way?
 <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C2V26">&nbsp;</a>For as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead also.
