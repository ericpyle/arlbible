 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C12V1">&nbsp;</a>Ephraim feedeth on wind, and followeth after the east wind: he daily increaseth lies and desolation;
and they do make a covenant with the Assyrians, and oil is carried into Egypt.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C12V2">&nbsp;</a>The LORD hath also a controversy with Judah, and will punish Jacob according to his ways; according to
his doings will he recompense him.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C12V3">&nbsp;</a>He took his brother by the heel in the womb, and by his strength he had power with God:
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C12V4">&nbsp;</a>Yea, he had power over the angel, and prevailed: he wept, and made supplication unto him: he found him
<span class="add">in</span> Bethel, and there he spake with us;
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C12V5">&nbsp;</a>Even the LORD God of hosts; the LORD
<span class="add">is</span> his memorial.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C12V6">&nbsp;</a>Therefore turn thou to thy God: keep mercy and judgment, and wait on thy God continually.

<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C12V7">&nbsp;</a><span class="add">He is</span> a merchant, the balances of deceit
<span class="add">are</span> in his hand: he loveth to oppress.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C12V8">&nbsp;</a>And Ephraim said, Yet I am become rich, I have found me out substance:
<span class="add">in</span> all my labours they shall find none iniquity in me that
<span class="add">were</span> sin.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C12V9">&nbsp;</a>And I
<span class="add">that am</span> the LORD thy God from the land of Egypt will yet make thee to dwell in tabernacles, as in the days of
the solemn feast.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C12V10">&nbsp;</a>I have also spoken by the prophets, and I have multiplied visions, and used similitudes, by the ministry
of the prophets.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C12V11">&nbsp;</a><span class="add">Is there</span> iniquity
<span class="add">in</span> Gilead? surely they are vanity: they sacrifice bullocks in Gilgal; yea, their altars
<span class="add">are</span> as heaps in the furrows of the fields.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C12V12">&nbsp;</a>And Jacob fled into the country of Syria, and Israel served for a wife, and for a wife he kept
<span class="add">sheep.
</span> <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C12V13">&nbsp;</a>And by a prophet the LORD brought Israel out of Egypt, and by a prophet was he preserved.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C12V14">&nbsp;</a>Ephraim provoked
<span class="add">him</span> to anger most bitterly: therefore shall he leave his blood upon him, and his reproach shall his Lord
return unto him.
