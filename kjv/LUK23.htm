 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C23V1">&nbsp;</a>And the whole multitude of them arose, and led him unto Pilate.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C23V2">&nbsp;</a>And they began to accuse him, saying, We found this
<span class="add">fellow
</span> perverting the nation, and forbidding to give tribute to Caesar, saying that he himself is Christ a
King.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C23V3">&nbsp;</a>And Pilate asked him, saying, Art thou the King of the Jews? And he answered him and said,
<span class="wj">Thou sayest
</span><span class="add">it.
</span> <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C23V4">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Then said Pilate to the chief priests and
</span><span class="add">to</span><span class="wj"> the people, I find no fault in this man.
</span> <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C23V5">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And they were the more fierce, saying, He stirreth up the people, teaching throughout all Jewry, beginning
from Galilee to this place.
</span> <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C23V6">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">When Pilate heard of Galilee, he asked whether the man were a Galilaean.
</span> <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C23V7">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And as soon as he knew that he belonged unto Herod’s jurisdiction, he sent him to Herod, who himself
also was at Jerusalem at that time.</span></div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C23V8">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And when Herod saw Jesus, he was exceeding glad: for he was desirous to see him of a long
</span><span class="add">season,</span><span class="wj"> because he had heard many things of him; and he hoped to have seen some miracle done by him.
</span> <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C23V9">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Then he questioned with him in many words; but he answered him nothing.
</span> <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C23V10">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And the chief priests and scribes stood and vehemently accused him.
</span> <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C23V11">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And Herod with his men of war set him at nought, and mocked
</span><span class="add">him,</span><span class="wj"> and arrayed him in a gorgeous robe, and sent him again to Pilate.</span></div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C23V12">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And the same day Pilate and Herod were made friends together: for before they were at enmity between
themselves.</span></div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C23V13">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And Pilate, when he had called together the chief priests and the rulers and the people,
</span> <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C23V14">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Said unto them, Ye have brought this man unto me, as one that perverteth the people: and, behold, I,
having examined
</span><span class="add">him</span><span class="wj"> before you, have found no fault in this man touching those things whereof ye accuse him:
</span> <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C23V15">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">No, nor yet Herod: for I sent you to him; and, lo, nothing worthy of death is done unto him.
</span> <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C23V16">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">I will therefore chastise him, and release
</span><span class="add">him.
</span> <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C23V17">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">(For of necessity he must release one unto them at the feast.)
</span> <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C23V18">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And they cried out all at once, saying, Away with this
</span><span class="add">man,
</span><span class="wj"> and release unto us Barabbas:
</span> <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C23V19">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">(Who for a certain sedition made in the city, and for murder, was cast into prison.)
</span> <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C23V20">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Pilate therefore, willing to release Jesus, spake again to them.
</span> <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C23V21">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">But they cried, saying, Crucify
</span><span class="add">him,</span><span class="wj"> crucify him.
</span> <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C23V22">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And he said unto them the third time, Why, what evil hath he done? I have found no cause of death in
him: I will therefore chastise him, and let
</span><span class="add">him</span><span class="wj"> go.
</span> <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C23V23">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And they were instant with loud voices, requiring that he might be crucified. And the voices of them
and of the chief priests prevailed.
</span> <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C23V24">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And Pilate gave sentence that it should be as they required.
</span> <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C23V25">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And he released unto them him that for sedition and murder was cast into prison, whom they had desired;
but he delivered Jesus to their will.
</span> <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C23V26">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And as they led him away, they laid hold upon one Simon, a Cyrenian, coming out of the country, and on
him they laid the cross, that he might bear
</span><span class="add">it</span><span class="wj"> after Jesus.</span></div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C23V27">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And there followed him a great company of people, and of women, which also bewailed and lamented him.
</span> <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C23V28">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">But Jesus turning unto them said, Daughters of Jerusalem, weep not for me, but weep for yourselves, and
for your children.
</span> <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C23V29">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">For, behold, the days are coming, in the which they shall say, Blessed
</span><span class="add">are</span><span class="wj"> the barren, and the wombs that never bare, and the paps which never gave suck.
</span> <span class="verse"> 30</span><a name="C23V30">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Then shall they begin to say to the mountains, Fall on us; and to the hills, Cover us.
</span> <span class="verse"> 31</span><a name="C23V31">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">For if they do these things in a green tree, what shall be done in the dry?
</span> <span class="verse"> 32</span><a name="C23V32">&nbsp;</a>And there were also two others, malefactors, led with him to be put to death.
 <span class="verse"> 33</span><a name="C23V33">&nbsp;</a>And when they were come to the place, which is called Calvary, there they crucified him, and the malefactors,
one on the right hand, and the other on the left.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 34</span><a name="C23V34">&nbsp;</a>Then said Jesus,
<span class="wj">Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do.</span> And they parted his raiment, and cast lots.
 <span class="verse"> 35</span><a name="C23V35">&nbsp;</a>And the people stood beholding. And the rulers also with them derided
<span class="add">him,</span> saying, He saved others; let him save himself, if he be Christ, the chosen of God.
 <span class="verse"> 36</span><a name="C23V36">&nbsp;</a>And the soldiers also mocked him, coming to him, and offering him vinegar,
 <span class="verse"> 37</span><a name="C23V37">&nbsp;</a>And saying, If thou be the king of the Jews, save thyself.
 <span class="verse"> 38</span><a name="C23V38">&nbsp;</a>And a superscription also was written over him in letters of Greek, and Latin, and Hebrew, THIS IS THE
KING OF THE JEWS.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 39</span><a name="C23V39">&nbsp;</a>And one of the malefactors which were hanged railed on him, saying, If thou be Christ, save thyself and
us.
 <span class="verse"> 40</span><a name="C23V40">&nbsp;</a>But the other answering rebuked him, saying, Dost not thou fear God, seeing thou art in the same condemnation?
 <span class="verse"> 41</span><a name="C23V41">&nbsp;</a>And we indeed justly; for we receive the due reward of our deeds: but this man hath done nothing amiss.
 <span class="verse"> 42</span><a name="C23V42">&nbsp;</a>And he said unto Jesus, Lord, remember me when thou comest into thy kingdom.
 <span class="verse"> 43</span><a name="C23V43">&nbsp;</a>And Jesus said unto him,
<span class="wj">Verily I say unto thee, To day shalt thou be with me in paradise.
</span> <span class="verse"> 44</span><a name="C23V44">&nbsp;</a>And it was about the sixth hour, and there was a darkness over all the earth until the ninth hour.
 <span class="verse"> 45</span><a name="C23V45">&nbsp;</a>And the sun was darkened, and the veil of the temple was rent in the midst.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 46</span><a name="C23V46">&nbsp;</a>And when Jesus had cried with a loud voice, he said,
<span class="wj">Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit: and having said thus, he gave up the ghost.
</span> <span class="verse"> 47</span><a name="C23V47">&nbsp;</a>Now when the centurion saw what was done, he glorified God, saying, Certainly this was a righteous man.
 <span class="verse"> 48</span><a name="C23V48">&nbsp;</a>And all the people that came together to that sight, beholding the things which were done, smote their
breasts, and returned.
 <span class="verse"> 49</span><a name="C23V49">&nbsp;</a>And all his acquaintance, and the women that followed him from Galilee, stood afar off, beholding these
things.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 50</span><a name="C23V50">&nbsp;</a>And, behold,
<span class="add">there was</span> a man named Joseph, a counsellor;
<span class="add">and he was</span> a good man, and a just:
 <span class="verse"> 51</span><a name="C23V51">&nbsp;</a>(The same had not consented to the counsel and deed of them;)
<span class="add">he was</span> of Arimathaea, a city of the Jews: who also himself waited for the kingdom of God.
 <span class="verse"> 52</span><a name="C23V52">&nbsp;</a>This
<span class="add">man</span> went unto Pilate, and begged the body of Jesus.
 <span class="verse"> 53</span><a name="C23V53">&nbsp;</a>And he took it down, and wrapped it in linen, and laid it in a sepulchre that was hewn in stone, wherein
never man before was laid.
 <span class="verse"> 54</span><a name="C23V54">&nbsp;</a>And that day was the preparation, and the sabbath drew on.
 <span class="verse"> 55</span><a name="C23V55">&nbsp;</a>And the women also, which came with him from Galilee, followed after, and beheld the sepulchre, and how
his body was laid.
 <span class="verse"> 56</span><a name="C23V56">&nbsp;</a>And they returned, and prepared spices and ointments; and rested the sabbath day according to the commandment.
