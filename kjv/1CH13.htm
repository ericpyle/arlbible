 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C13V1">&nbsp;</a>And David consulted with the captains of thousands and hundreds,
<span class="add">and</span> with every leader.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C13V2">&nbsp;</a>And David said unto all the congregation of Israel, If
<span class="add">it seem
</span> good unto you, and
<span class="add">that it be</span> of the LORD our God, let us send abroad unto our brethren every where,
<span class="add">that are</span> left in all the land of Israel, and with them
<span class="add">also</span> to the priests and Levites
<span class="add">which are</span> in their cities
<span class="add">and</span> suburbs, that they may gather themselves unto us:
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C13V3">&nbsp;</a>And let us bring again the ark of our God to us: for we enquired not at it in the days of Saul.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C13V4">&nbsp;</a>And all the congregation said that they would do so: for the thing was right in the eyes of all the people.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C13V5">&nbsp;</a>So David gathered all Israel together, from Shihor of Egypt even unto the entering of Hemath, to bring
the ark of God from Kirjath-jearim.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C13V6">&nbsp;</a>And David went up, and all Israel, to Baalah,
<span class="add">that is,</span> to Kirjath- jearim, which
<span class="add">belonged</span> to Judah, to bring up thence the ark of God the LORD, that dwelleth
<span class="add">between</span> the cherubims, whose name is called
<span class="add">on it.
</span> <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C13V7">&nbsp;</a>And they carried the ark of God in a new cart out of the house of Abinadab: and Uzza and Ahio drave the
cart.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C13V8">&nbsp;</a>And David and all Israel played before God with all
<span class="add">their
</span> might, and with singing, and with harps, and with psalteries, and with timbrels, and with cymbals, and
with trumpets.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C13V9">&nbsp;</a>And when they came unto the threshingfloor of Chidon, Uzza put forth his hand to hold the ark; for the
oxen stumbled.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C13V10">&nbsp;</a>And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Uzza, and he smote him, because he put his hand to the
ark: and there he died before God.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C13V11">&nbsp;</a>And David was displeased, because the LORD had made a breach upon Uzza: wherefore that place is called
Perez-uzza to this day.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C13V12">&nbsp;</a>And David was afraid of God that day, saying, How shall I bring the ark of God
<span class="add">home</span> to me?
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C13V13">&nbsp;</a>So David brought not the ark
<span class="add">home</span> to himself to the city of David, but carried it aside into the house of Obed-edom the Gittite.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C13V14">&nbsp;</a>And the ark of God remained with the family of Obed-edom in his house three months. And the LORD blessed
the house of Obed-edom, and all that he had.
