 <span class="verse" id="V1">1&nbsp;</span>And David consulted with the captains of thousands and hundreds, <span class='add'>and</span> with every leader.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span>And David said unto all the congregation of Israel, If <span class='add'>it seem</span> good unto you, and <span class='add'>that it be</span> of the LORD our God, let us send abroad unto our brethren every where, <span class='add'>that are</span> left in all the land of Israel, and with them <span class='add'>also</span> to the priests and Levites <span class='add'>which are</span> in their cities <span class='add'>and</span> suburbs, that they may gather themselves unto us:  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>And let us bring again the ark of our God to us: for we enquired not at it in the days of Saul.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>And all the congregation said that they would do so: for the thing was right in the eyes of all the people.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>So David gathered all Israel together, from Shihor of Egypt even unto the entering of Hemath, to bring the ark of God from Kirjath-jearim.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>And David went up, and all Israel, to Baalah, <span class='add'>that is</span>, to Kirjath-jearim, which <span class='add'>belonged</span> to Judah, to bring up thence the ark of God the LORD, that dwelleth <span class='add'>between</span> the cherubims, whose name is called <span class='add'>on it</span>.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>And they carried the ark of God in a new cart out of the house of Abinadab: and Uzza and Ahio drave the cart.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>And David and all Israel played before God with all <span class='add'>their</span> might, and with singing, and with harps, and with psalteries, and with timbrels, and with cymbals, and with trumpets. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>And when they came unto the threshingfloor of Chidon, Uzza put forth his hand to hold the ark; for the oxen stumbled.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Uzza, and he smote him, because he put his hand to the ark: and there he died before God.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>And David was displeased, because the LORD had made a breach upon Uzza: wherefore that place is called Perez-uzza to this day.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>And David was afraid of God that day, saying, How shall I bring the ark of God <span class='add'>home</span> to me?  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>So David brought not the ark <span class='add'>home</span> to himself to the city of David, but carried it aside into the house of Obed-edom the Gittite.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>And the ark of God remained with the family of Obed-edom in his house three months. And the LORD blessed the house of Obed-edom, and all that he had. </div><ul class='tnav'>
