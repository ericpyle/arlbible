 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C20V1">&nbsp;</a>And it came to pass in the seventh year, in the fifth
<span class="add">month,
</span> the tenth
<span class="add">day</span> of the month,
<span class="add">that</span> certain of the elders of Israel came to enquire of the LORD, and sat before me.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C20V2">&nbsp;</a>Then came the word of the LORD unto me, saying,
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C20V3">&nbsp;</a>Son of man, speak unto the elders of Israel, and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Are ye come
to enquire of me?
<span class="add">As</span> I live, saith the Lord GOD, I will not be enquired of by you.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C20V4">&nbsp;</a>Wilt thou judge them, son of man, wilt thou judge
<span class="add">them?</span> cause them to know the abominations of their fathers:
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C20V5">&nbsp;</a>And say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; In the day when I chose Israel, and lifted up mine hand unto
the seed of the house of Jacob, and made myself known unto them in the land of Egypt, when I lifted up
mine hand unto them, saying, I
<span class="add">am</span> the LORD your God;
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C20V6">&nbsp;</a>In the day
<span class="add">that</span> I lifted up mine hand unto them, to bring them forth of the land of Egypt into a land that I had espied
for them, flowing with milk and honey, which
<span class="add">is</span> the glory of all lands:
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C20V7">&nbsp;</a>Then said I unto them, Cast ye away every man the abominations of his eyes, and defile not yourselves
with the idols of Egypt: I
<span class="add">am</span> the LORD your God.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C20V8">&nbsp;</a>But they rebelled against me, and would not hearken unto me: they did not every man cast away the abominations
of their eyes, neither did they forsake the idols of Egypt: then I said, I will pour out my fury upon
them to accomplish my anger against them in the midst of the land of Egypt.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C20V9">&nbsp;</a>But I wrought for my name’s sake, that it should not be polluted before the heathen, among whom they
<span class="add">were,</span> in whose sight I made myself known unto them, in bringing them forth out of the land of Egypt.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C20V10">&nbsp;</a>Wherefore I caused them to go forth out of the land of Egypt, and brought them into the wilderness.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C20V11">&nbsp;</a>And I gave them my statutes, and shewed them my judgments, which
<span class="add">if</span> a man do, he shall even live in them.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C20V12">&nbsp;</a>Moreover also I gave them my sabbaths, to be a sign between me and them, that they might know that I
<span class="add">am</span> the LORD that sanctify them.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C20V13">&nbsp;</a>But the house of Israel rebelled against me in the wilderness: they walked not in my statutes, and they
despised my judgments, which
<span class="add">if
</span> a man do, he shall even live in them; and my sabbaths they greatly polluted: then I said, I would pour
out my fury upon them in the wilderness, to consume them.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C20V14">&nbsp;</a>But I wrought for my name’s sake, that it should not be polluted before the heathen, in whose sight I
brought them out.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C20V15">&nbsp;</a>Yet also I lifted up my hand unto them in the wilderness, that I would not bring them into the land which
I had given
<span class="add">them,</span> flowing with milk and honey, which
<span class="add">is</span> the glory of all lands;
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C20V16">&nbsp;</a>Because they despised my judgments, and walked not in my statutes, but polluted my sabbaths: for their
heart went after their idols.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C20V17">&nbsp;</a>Nevertheless mine eye spared them from destroying them, neither did I make an end of them in the wilderness.
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C20V18">&nbsp;</a>But I said unto their children in the wilderness, Walk ye not in the statutes of your fathers, neither
observe their judgments, nor defile yourselves with their idols:
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C20V19">&nbsp;</a>I
<span class="add">am</span> the LORD your God; walk in my statutes, and keep my judgments, and do them;
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C20V20">&nbsp;</a>And hallow my sabbaths; and they shall be a sign between me and you, that ye may know that I
<span class="add">am</span> the LORD your God.
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C20V21">&nbsp;</a>Notwithstanding the children rebelled against me: they walked not in my statutes, neither kept my judgments
to do them, which
<span class="add">if</span> a man do, he shall even live in them; they polluted my sabbaths: then I said, I would pour out my fury
upon them, to accomplish my anger against them in the wilderness.
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C20V22">&nbsp;</a>Nevertheless I withdrew mine hand, and wrought for my name’s sake, that it should not be polluted in
the sight of the heathen, in whose sight I brought them forth.
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C20V23">&nbsp;</a>I lifted up mine hand unto them also in the wilderness, that I would scatter them among the heathen,
and disperse them through the countries;
 <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C20V24">&nbsp;</a>Because they had not executed my judgments, but had despised my statutes, and had polluted my sabbaths,
and their eyes were after their fathers’ idols.
 <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C20V25">&nbsp;</a>Wherefore I gave them also statutes
<span class="add">that were</span> not good, and judgments whereby they should not live;
 <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C20V26">&nbsp;</a>And I polluted them in their own gifts, in that they caused to pass through
<span class="add">the fire</span> all that openeth the womb, that I might make them desolate, to the end that they might know that I
<span class="add">am</span> the LORD.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C20V27">&nbsp;</a>Therefore, son of man, speak unto the house of Israel, and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Yet
in this your fathers have blasphemed me, in that they have committed a trespass against me.
 <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C20V28">&nbsp;</a><span class="add">For</span> when I had brought them into the land,
<span class="add">for
</span> the which I lifted up mine hand to give it to them, then they saw every high hill, and all the thick
trees, and they offered there their sacrifices, and there they presented the provocation of their offering:
there also they made their sweet savour, and poured out there their drink offerings.
 <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C20V29">&nbsp;</a>Then I said unto them, What
<span class="add">is</span> the high place whereunto ye go? And the name thereof is called Bamah unto this day.
 <span class="verse"> 30</span><a name="C20V30">&nbsp;</a>Wherefore say unto the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Are ye polluted after the manner of
your fathers? and commit ye whoredom after their abominations?
 <span class="verse"> 31</span><a name="C20V31">&nbsp;</a>For when ye offer your gifts, when ye make your sons to pass through the fire, ye pollute yourselves
with all your idols, even unto this day: and shall I be enquired of by you, O house of Israel?
<span class="add">As</span> I live, saith the Lord GOD, I will not be enquired of by you.
 <span class="verse"> 32</span><a name="C20V32">&nbsp;</a>And that which cometh into your mind shall not be at all, that ye say, We will be as the heathen, as
the families of the countries, to serve wood and stone.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 33</span><a name="C20V33">&nbsp;</a><span class="add">As</span> I live, saith the Lord GOD, surely with a mighty hand, and with a stretched out arm, and with fury poured
out, will I rule over you:
 <span class="verse"> 34</span><a name="C20V34">&nbsp;</a>And I will bring you out from the people, and will gather you out of the countries wherein ye are scattered,
with a mighty hand, and with a stretched out arm, and with fury poured out.
 <span class="verse"> 35</span><a name="C20V35">&nbsp;</a>And I will bring you into the wilderness of the people, and there will I plead with you face to face.
 <span class="verse"> 36</span><a name="C20V36">&nbsp;</a>Like as I pleaded with your fathers in the wilderness of the land of Egypt, so will I plead with you,
saith the Lord GOD.
 <span class="verse"> 37</span><a name="C20V37">&nbsp;</a>And I will cause you to pass under the rod, and I will bring you into the bond of the covenant:
 <span class="verse"> 38</span><a name="C20V38">&nbsp;</a>And I will purge out from among you the rebels, and them that transgress against me: I will bring them
forth out of the country where they sojourn, and they shall not enter into the land of Israel: and ye
shall know that I
<span class="add">am</span> the LORD.
 <span class="verse"> 39</span><a name="C20V39">&nbsp;</a>As for you, O house of Israel, thus saith the Lord GOD; Go ye, serve ye every one his idols, and hereafter
<span class="add">also,</span> if ye will not hearken unto me: but pollute ye my holy name no more with your gifts, and with your idols.
 <span class="verse"> 40</span><a name="C20V40">&nbsp;</a>For in mine holy mountain, in the mountain of the height of Israel, saith the Lord GOD, there shall all
the house of Israel, all of them in the land, serve me: there will I accept them, and there will I require
your offerings, and the firstfruits of your oblations, with all your holy things.
 <span class="verse"> 41</span><a name="C20V41">&nbsp;</a>I will accept you with your sweet savour, when I bring you out from the people, and gather you out of
the countries wherein ye have been scattered; and I will be sanctified in you before the heathen.
 <span class="verse"> 42</span><a name="C20V42">&nbsp;</a>And ye shall know that I
<span class="add">am</span> the LORD, when I shall bring you into the land of Israel, into the country
<span class="add">for</span> the which I lifted up mine hand to give it to your fathers.
 <span class="verse"> 43</span><a name="C20V43">&nbsp;</a>And there shall ye remember your ways, and all your doings, wherein ye have been defiled; and ye shall
lothe yourselves in your own sight for all your evils that ye have committed.
 <span class="verse"> 44</span><a name="C20V44">&nbsp;</a>And ye shall know that I
<span class="add">am</span> the LORD, when I have wrought with you for my name’s sake, not according to your wicked ways, nor according
to your corrupt doings, O ye house of Israel, saith the Lord GOD.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 45</span><a name="C20V45">&nbsp;</a>Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,
 <span class="verse"> 46</span><a name="C20V46">&nbsp;</a>Son of man, set thy face toward the south, and drop
<span class="add">thy word
</span> toward the south, and prophesy against the forest of the south field;
 <span class="verse"> 47</span><a name="C20V47">&nbsp;</a>And say to the forest of the south, Hear the word of the LORD; Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will
kindle a fire in thee, and it shall devour every green tree in thee, and every dry tree: the flaming
flame shall not be quenched, and all faces from the south to the north shall be burned therein.
 <span class="verse"> 48</span><a name="C20V48">&nbsp;</a>And all flesh shall see that I the LORD have kindled it: it shall not be quenched.
 <span class="verse"> 49</span><a name="C20V49">&nbsp;</a>Then said I, Ah Lord GOD! they say of me, Doth he not speak parables?
