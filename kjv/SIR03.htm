 <span class="verse" id="V1">1&nbsp;</span>Hear me your father, O children, and do thereafter, that ye may be safe. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span>For the Lord hath given the father honour over the children, and hath confirmed the authority of the mother over the sons. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>Whoso honoureth his father maketh an atonement for his sins: </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>And he that honoureth his mother is as one that layeth up treasure. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>Whoso honoureth his father shall have joy of his own children; and when he maketh his prayer, he shall be heard. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>He that honoureth his father shall have a long life; and he that is obedient unto the Lord shall be a comfort to his mother. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>He that feareth the Lord will honour his father, and will do service unto his parents, as to his masters. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>Honour thy father and mother both in word and deed, that a blessing may come upon thee from them. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>For the blessing of the father establisheth the houses of children; but the curse of the mother rooteth out foundations. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>Glory not in the dishonour of thy father; for thy father’s dishonour is no glory unto thee. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>For the glory of a man is from the honour of his father; and a mother in dishonour is a reproach to the children. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>My son, help thy father in his age, and grieve him not as long as he liveth. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>And if his understanding fail, have patience with him; and despise him not when thou art in thy full strength. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>For the relieving of thy father shall not be forgotten: and instead of sins it shall be added to build thee up. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>In the day of thine affliction it shall be remembered; thy sins also shall melt away, as the ice in the fair warm weather. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>He that forsaketh his father is as a blasphemer; and he that angereth his mother is cursed: of God. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>My son, go on with thy business in meekness; so shalt thou be beloved of him that is approved. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>The greater thou art, the more humble thyself, and thou shalt find favour before the Lord. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>Many are in high place, and of renown: but mysteries are revealed unto the meek. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>For the power of the Lord is great, and he is honoured of the lowly. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>Seek not out things that are too hard for thee, neither search the things that are above thy strength. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>But what is commanded thee, think thereupon with reverence, for it is not needful for thee to see with thine eyes the things that are in secret. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>Be not curious in unnecessary matters: for more things are shewed unto thee than men understand. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>For many are deceived by their own vain opinion; and an evil suspicion hath overthrown their judgment. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>Without eyes thou shalt want light: profess not the knowledge therefore that thou hast not. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>A stubborn heart shall fare evil at the last; and he that loveth danger shall perish therein. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>An obstinate heart shall be laden with sorrows; and the wicked man shall heap sin upon sin. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V28">28&nbsp;</span>In the punishment of the proud there is no remedy; for the plant of wickedness hath taken root in him. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V29">29&nbsp;</span>The heart of the prudent will understand a parable; and an attentive ear is the desire of a wise man. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V30">30&nbsp;</span>Water will quench a flaming fire; and alms maketh an atonement for sins. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V31">31&nbsp;</span>And he that requiteth good turns is mindful of that which may come hereafter; and when he falleth, he shall find a stay. </div><ul class='tnav'>
