 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C14V1">&nbsp;</a>And all the congregation lifted up their voice, and cried; and the people wept that night.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C14V2">&nbsp;</a>And all the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron: and the whole congregation said
unto them, Would God that we had died in the land of Egypt! or would God we had died in this wilderness!
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C14V3">&nbsp;</a>And wherefore hath the LORD brought us unto this land, to fall by the sword, that our wives and our children
should be a prey? were it not better for us to return into Egypt?
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C14V4">&nbsp;</a>And they said one to another, Let us make a captain, and let us return into Egypt.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C14V5">&nbsp;</a>Then Moses and Aaron fell on their faces before all the assembly of the congregation of the children
of Israel.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C14V6">&nbsp;</a>And Joshua the son of Nun, and Caleb the son of Jephunneh,
<span class="add">which were</span> of them that searched the land, rent their clothes:
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C14V7">&nbsp;</a>And they spake unto all the company of the children of Israel, saying, The land, which we passed through
to search it,
<span class="add">is</span> an exceeding good land.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C14V8">&nbsp;</a>If the LORD delight in us, then he will bring us into this land, and give it us; a land which floweth
with milk and honey.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C14V9">&nbsp;</a>Only rebel not ye against the LORD, neither fear ye the people of the land; for they
<span class="add">are</span> bread for us: their defence is departed from them, and the LORD
<span class="add">is</span> with us: fear them not.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C14V10">&nbsp;</a>But all the congregation bade stone them with stones. And the glory of the LORD appeared in the tabernacle
of the congregation before all the children of Israel.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C14V11">&nbsp;</a>And the LORD said unto Moses, How long will this people provoke me? and how long will it be ere they
believe me, for all the signs which I have shewed among them?
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C14V12">&nbsp;</a>I will smite them with the pestilence, and disinherit them, and will make of thee a greater nation and
mightier than they.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C14V13">&nbsp;</a>And Moses said unto the LORD, Then the Egyptians shall hear
<span class="add">it,
</span> (for thou broughtest up this people in thy might from among them;)
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C14V14">&nbsp;</a>And they will tell
<span class="add">it</span> to the inhabitants of this land:
<span class="add">for</span> they have heard that thou LORD
<span class="add">art</span> among this people, that thou LORD art seen face to face, and
<span class="add">that</span> thy cloud standeth over them, and
<span class="add">that</span> thou goest before them, by daytime in a pillar of a cloud, and in a pillar of fire by night.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C14V15">&nbsp;</a>Now
<span class="add">if</span> thou shalt kill
<span class="add">all</span> this people as one man, then the nations which have heard the fame of thee will speak, saying,
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C14V16">&nbsp;</a>Because the LORD was not able to bring this people into the land which he sware unto them, therefore
he hath slain them in the wilderness.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C14V17">&nbsp;</a>And now, I beseech thee, let the power of my Lord be great, according as thou hast spoken, saying,
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C14V18">&nbsp;</a>The LORD
<span class="add">is</span> longsuffering, and of great mercy, forgiving iniquity and transgression, and by no means clearing
<span class="add">the guilty,
</span> visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth
<span class="add">generation.
</span> <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C14V19">&nbsp;</a>Pardon, I beseech thee, the iniquity of this people according unto the greatness of thy mercy, and as
thou hast forgiven this people, from Egypt even until now.
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C14V20">&nbsp;</a>And the LORD said, I have pardoned according to thy word:
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C14V21">&nbsp;</a>But
<span class="add">as</span> truly
<span class="add">as</span> I live, all the earth shall be filled with the glory of the LORD.
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C14V22">&nbsp;</a>Because all those men which have seen my glory, and my miracles, which I did in Egypt and in the wilderness,
and have tempted me now these ten times, and have not hearkened to my voice;
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C14V23">&nbsp;</a>Surely they shall not see the land which I sware unto their fathers, neither shall any of them that provoked
me see it:
 <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C14V24">&nbsp;</a>But my servant Caleb, because he had another spirit with him, and hath followed me fully, him will I
bring into the land whereinto he went; and his seed shall possess it.
 <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C14V25">&nbsp;</a>(Now the Amalekites and the Canaanites dwelt in the valley.) To morrow turn you, and get you into the
wilderness by the way of the Red sea.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C14V26">&nbsp;</a>And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,
 <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C14V27">&nbsp;</a>How long
<span class="add">shall I bear with</span> this evil congregation, which murmur against me? I have heard the murmurings of the children of Israel,
which they murmur against me.
 <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C14V28">&nbsp;</a>Say unto them,
<span class="add">As truly as</span> I live, saith the LORD, as ye have spoken in mine ears, so will I do to you:
 <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C14V29">&nbsp;</a>Your carcases shall fall in this wilderness; and all that were numbered of you, according to your whole
number, from twenty years old and upward, which have murmured against me,
 <span class="verse"> 30</span><a name="C14V30">&nbsp;</a>Doubtless ye shall not come into the land,
<span class="add">concerning</span> which I sware to make you dwell therein, save Caleb the son of Jephunneh, and Joshua the son of Nun.
 <span class="verse"> 31</span><a name="C14V31">&nbsp;</a>But your little ones, which ye said should be a prey, them will I bring in, and they shall know the land
which ye have despised.
 <span class="verse"> 32</span><a name="C14V32">&nbsp;</a>But
<span class="add">as for</span> you, your carcases, they shall fall in this wilderness.
 <span class="verse"> 33</span><a name="C14V33">&nbsp;</a>And your children shall wander in the wilderness forty years, and bear your whoredoms, until your carcases
be wasted in the wilderness.
 <span class="verse"> 34</span><a name="C14V34">&nbsp;</a>After the number of the days in which ye searched the land,
<span class="add">even
</span> forty days, each day for a year, shall ye bear your iniquities,
<span class="add">even</span> forty years, and ye shall know my breach of promise.
 <span class="verse"> 35</span><a name="C14V35">&nbsp;</a>I the LORD have said, I will surely do it unto all this evil congregation, that are gathered together
against me: in this wilderness they shall be consumed, and there they shall die.
 <span class="verse"> 36</span><a name="C14V36">&nbsp;</a>And the men, which Moses sent to search the land, who returned, and made all the congregation to murmur
against him, by bringing up a slander upon the land,
 <span class="verse"> 37</span><a name="C14V37">&nbsp;</a>Even those men that did bring up the evil report upon the land, died by the plague before the LORD.
 <span class="verse"> 38</span><a name="C14V38">&nbsp;</a>But Joshua the son of Nun, and Caleb the son of Jephunneh,
<span class="add">which were</span> of the men that went to search the land, lived
<span class="add">still.
</span> <span class="verse"> 39</span><a name="C14V39">&nbsp;</a>And Moses told these sayings unto all the children of Israel: and the people mourned greatly.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 40</span><a name="C14V40">&nbsp;</a>And they rose up early in the morning, and gat them up into the top of the mountain, saying, Lo, we
<span class="add">be here,</span> and will go up unto the place which the LORD hath promised: for we have sinned.
 <span class="verse"> 41</span><a name="C14V41">&nbsp;</a>And Moses said, Wherefore now do ye transgress the commandment of the LORD? but it shall not prosper.
 <span class="verse"> 42</span><a name="C14V42">&nbsp;</a>Go not up, for the LORD
<span class="add">is</span> not among you; that ye be not smitten before your enemies.
 <span class="verse"> 43</span><a name="C14V43">&nbsp;</a>For the Amalekites and the Canaanites
<span class="add">are</span> there before you, and ye shall fall by the sword: because ye are turned away from the LORD, therefore
the LORD will not be with you.
 <span class="verse"> 44</span><a name="C14V44">&nbsp;</a>But they presumed to go up unto the hill top: nevertheless the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and Moses,
departed not out of the camp.
 <span class="verse"> 45</span><a name="C14V45">&nbsp;</a>Then the Amalekites came down, and the Canaanites which dwelt in that hill, and smote them, and discomfited
them,
<span class="add">even</span> unto Hormah.
