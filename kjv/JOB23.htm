No; but he would put <span class='add'>strength</span> in me.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>There the righteous might dispute with him; so should I be delivered for ever from my judge.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>Behold, I go forward, but he <span class='add'>is</span> not <span class='add'>there;</span> and backward, but I cannot perceive him:  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>On the left hand, where he doth work, but I cannot behold <span class='add'>him:</span> he hideth himself on the right hand, that I cannot see <span class='add'>him:</span>  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>But he knoweth the way that I take: <span class='add'>when</span> he hath tried me, I shall come forth as gold.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>My foot hath held his steps, his way have I kept, and not declined.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>Neither have I gone back from the commandment of his lips; I have esteemed the words of his mouth more than my necessary <span class='add'>food</span>.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>But he <span class='add'>is</span> in one <span class='add'>mind</span>, and who can turn him? and <span class='add'>what</span> his soul desireth, even <span class='add'>that</span> he doeth.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>For he performeth <span class='add'>the thing that is</span> appointed for me: and many such <span class='add'>things are</span> with him.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>Therefore am I troubled at his presence: when I consider, I am afraid of him.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>For God maketh my heart soft, and the Almighty troubleth me:  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>Because I was not cut off before the darkness, <span class='add'>neither</span> hath he covered the darkness from my face. </div><ul class='tnav'>
