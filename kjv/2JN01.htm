</div>
<div class="chapterlabel"> 1</div><div class="p">
 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C1V1">&nbsp;</a>The elder unto the elect lady and her children, whom I love in the truth; and not I only, but also all
they that have known the truth;
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C1V2">&nbsp;</a>For the truth’s sake, which dwelleth in us, and shall be with us for ever.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C1V3">&nbsp;</a>Grace be with you, mercy,
<span class="add">and</span> peace, from God the Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in truth and love.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C1V4">&nbsp;</a>I rejoiced greatly that I found of thy children walking in truth, as we have received a commandment from
the Father.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C1V5">&nbsp;</a>And now I beseech thee, lady, not as though I wrote a new commandment unto thee, but that which we had
from the beginning, that we love one another.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C1V6">&nbsp;</a>And this is love, that we walk after his commandments. This is the commandment, That, as ye have heard
from the beginning, ye should walk in it.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C1V7">&nbsp;</a>For many deceivers are entered into the world, who confess not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh.
This is a deceiver and an antichrist.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C1V8">&nbsp;</a>Look to yourselves, that we lose not those things which we have wrought, but that we receive a full reward.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C1V9">&nbsp;</a>Whosoever transgresseth, and abideth not in the doctrine of Christ, hath not God. He that abideth in
the doctrine of Christ, he hath both the Father and the Son.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C1V10">&nbsp;</a>If there come any unto you, and bring not this doctrine, receive him not into
<span class="add">your</span> house, neither bid him God speed:
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C1V11">&nbsp;</a>For he that biddeth him God speed is partaker of his evil deeds.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C1V12">&nbsp;</a>Having many things to write unto you, I would not
<span class="add">write</span> with paper and ink: but I trust to come unto you, and speak face to face, that our joy may be full.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C1V13">&nbsp;</a>The children of thy elect sister greet thee. Amen.
