 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C3V1">&nbsp;</a>Woe to the bloody city! it is all full of lies
<span class="add">and</span> robbery; the prey departeth not;
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C3V2">&nbsp;</a>The noise of a whip, and the noise of the rattling of the wheels, and of the pransing horses, and of
the jumping chariots.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C3V3">&nbsp;</a>The horseman lifteth up both the bright sword and the glittering spear: and
<span class="add">there is</span> a multitude of slain, and a great number of carcases; and
<span class="add">there is</span> none end of
<span class="add">their</span> corpses; they stumble upon their corpses:
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C3V4">&nbsp;</a>Because of the multitude of the whoredoms of the wellfavoured harlot, the mistress of witchcrafts, that
selleth nations through her whoredoms, and families through her witchcrafts.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C3V5">&nbsp;</a>Behold, I
<span class="add">am</span> against thee, saith the LORD of hosts; and I will discover thy skirts upon thy face, and I will shew
the nations thy nakedness, and the kingdoms thy shame.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C3V6">&nbsp;</a>And I will cast abominable filth upon thee, and make thee vile, and will set thee as a gazingstock.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C3V7">&nbsp;</a>And it shall come to pass,
<span class="add">that</span> all they that look upon thee shall flee from thee, and say, Nineveh is laid waste: who will bemoan her?
whence shall I seek comforters for thee?
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C3V8">&nbsp;</a>Art thou better than populous No, that was situate among the rivers,
<span class="add">that had</span> the waters round about it, whose rampart
<span class="add">was
</span> the sea,
<span class="add">and</span> her wall
<span class="add">was</span> from the sea?
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C3V9">&nbsp;</a>Ethiopia and Egypt
<span class="add">were</span> her strength, and
<span class="add">it was
</span> infinite; Put and Lubim were thy helpers.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C3V10">&nbsp;</a>Yet
<span class="add">was</span> she carried away, she went into captivity: her young children also were dashed in pieces at the top
of all the streets: and they cast lots for her honourable men, and all her great men were bound in chains.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C3V11">&nbsp;</a>Thou also shalt be drunken: thou shalt be hid, thou also shalt seek strength because of the enemy.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C3V12">&nbsp;</a>All thy strong holds
<span class="add">shall be like</span> fig trees with the firstripe figs: if they be shaken, they shall even fall into the mouth of the eater.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C3V13">&nbsp;</a>Behold, thy people in the midst of thee
<span class="add">are</span> women: the gates of thy land shall be set wide open unto thine enemies: the fire shall devour thy bars.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C3V14">&nbsp;</a>Draw thee waters for the siege, fortify thy strong holds: go into clay, and tread the morter, make strong
the brickkiln.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C3V15">&nbsp;</a>There shall the fire devour thee; the sword shall cut thee off, it shall eat thee up like the cankerworm:
make thyself many as the cankerworm, make thyself many as the locusts.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C3V16">&nbsp;</a>Thou hast multiplied thy merchants above the stars of heaven: the cankerworm spoileth, and fleeth away.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C3V17">&nbsp;</a>Thy crowned
<span class="add">are</span> as the locusts, and thy captains as the great grasshoppers, which camp in the hedges in the cold day,
<span class="add">but</span> when the sun ariseth they flee away, and their place is not known where they
<span class="add">are.
</span> <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C3V18">&nbsp;</a>Thy shepherds slumber, O king of Assyria: thy nobles shall dwell
<span class="add">in the dust:</span> thy people is scattered upon the mountains, and no man gathereth
<span class="add">them.
</span> <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C3V19">&nbsp;</a><span class="add">There is</span> no healing of thy bruise; thy wound is grievous: all that hear the bruit of thee shall clap the hands
over thee: for upon whom hath not thy wickedness passed continually?
