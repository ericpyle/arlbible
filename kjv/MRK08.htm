 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C8V1">&nbsp;</a>In those days the multitude being very great, and having nothing to eat, Jesus called his disciples
<span class="add">unto him,</span> and saith unto them,
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C8V2">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">I have compassion on the multitude, because they have now been with me three days, and have nothing to
eat:
</span> <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C8V3">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And if I send them away fasting to their own houses, they will faint by the way: for divers of them came
from far.
</span> <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C8V4">&nbsp;</a>And his disciples answered him, From whence can a man satisfy these
<span class="add">men</span> with bread here in the wilderness?
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C8V5">&nbsp;</a>And he asked them,
<span class="wj">How many loaves have ye?</span> And they said, Seven.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C8V6">&nbsp;</a>And he commanded the people to sit down on the ground: and he took the seven loaves, and gave thanks,
and brake, and gave to his disciples to set before
<span class="add">them;</span> and they did set
<span class="add">them</span> before the people.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C8V7">&nbsp;</a>And they had a few small fishes: and he blessed, and commanded to set them also before
<span class="add">them.
</span> <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C8V8">&nbsp;</a>So they did eat, and were filled: and they took up of the broken
<span class="add">meat</span> that was left seven baskets.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C8V9">&nbsp;</a>And they that had eaten were about four thousand: and he sent them away.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C8V10">&nbsp;</a>And straightway he entered into a ship with his disciples, and came into the parts of Dalmanutha.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C8V11">&nbsp;</a>And the Pharisees came forth, and began to question with him, seeking of him a sign from heaven, tempting
him.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C8V12">&nbsp;</a>And he sighed deeply in his spirit, and saith,
<span class="wj">Why doth this generation seek after a sign? verily I say unto you, There shall no sign be given unto
this generation.
</span> <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C8V13">&nbsp;</a>And he left them, and entering into the ship again departed to the other side.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C8V14">&nbsp;</a>Now
<span class="add">the disciples</span> had forgotten to take bread, neither had they in the ship with them more than one loaf.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C8V15">&nbsp;</a>And he charged them, saying,
<span class="wj">Take heed, beware of the leaven of the Pharisees, and
</span><span class="add">of</span><span class="wj"> the leaven of Herod.
</span> <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C8V16">&nbsp;</a>And they reasoned among themselves, saying,
<span class="add">It is</span> because we have no bread.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C8V17">&nbsp;</a>And when Jesus knew
<span class="add">it,</span> he saith unto them,
<span class="wj">Why reason ye, because ye have no bread? perceive ye not yet, neither understand? have ye your heart
yet hardened?
</span> <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C8V18">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Having eyes, see ye not? and having ears, hear ye not? and do ye not remember?
</span> <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C8V19">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">When I brake the five loaves among five thousand, how many baskets full of fragments took ye up?</span> They say unto him, Twelve.
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C8V20">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And when the seven among four thousand, how many baskets full of fragments took ye up?</span> And they said, Seven.
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C8V21">&nbsp;</a>And he said unto them,
<span class="wj">How is it that ye do not understand?
</span></div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C8V22">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And he cometh to Bethsaida; and they bring a blind man unto him, and besought him to touch him.
</span> <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C8V23">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And he took the blind man by the hand, and led him out of the town; and when he had spit on his eyes,
and put his hands upon him, he asked him if he saw ought.
</span> <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C8V24">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And he looked up, and said, I see men as trees, walking.
</span> <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C8V25">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">After that he put
</span><span class="add">his</span><span class="wj"> hands again upon his eyes, and made him look up: and he was restored, and saw every man clearly.
</span> <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C8V26">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And he sent him away to his house, saying, Neither go into the town, nor tell
</span><span class="add">it</span><span class="wj"> to any in the town.</span></div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C8V27">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And Jesus went out, and his disciples, into the towns of Caesarea Philippi: and by the way he asked his
disciples, saying unto them, Whom do men say that I am?
</span> <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C8V28">&nbsp;</a>And they answered, John the Baptist: but some
<span class="add">say,</span> Elias; and others, One of the prophets.
 <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C8V29">&nbsp;</a>And he saith unto them,
<span class="wj">But whom say ye that I am?</span> And Peter answereth and saith unto him, Thou art the Christ.
 <span class="verse"> 30</span><a name="C8V30">&nbsp;</a>And he charged them that they should tell no man of him.
 <span class="verse"> 31</span><a name="C8V31">&nbsp;</a>And he began to teach them, that the Son of man must suffer many things, and be rejected of the elders,
and
<span class="add">of</span> the chief priests, and scribes, and be killed, and after three days rise again.
 <span class="verse"> 32</span><a name="C8V32">&nbsp;</a>And he spake that saying openly. And Peter took him, and began to rebuke him.
 <span class="verse"> 33</span><a name="C8V33">&nbsp;</a>But when he had turned about and looked on his disciples, he rebuked Peter, saying,
<span class="wj">Get thee behind me, Satan: for thou savourest not the things that be of God, but the things that be of
men.</span></div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 34</span><a name="C8V34">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And when he had called the people
</span><span class="add">unto him</span><span class="wj"> with his disciples also, he said unto them, Whosoever will come after me, let him deny himself, and
take up his cross, and follow me.
</span> <span class="verse"> 35</span><a name="C8V35">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">For whosoever will save his life shall lose it; but whosoever shall lose his life for my sake and the
gospel’s, the same shall save it.
</span> <span class="verse"> 36</span><a name="C8V36">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?
</span> <span class="verse"> 37</span><a name="C8V37">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?
</span> <span class="verse"> 38</span><a name="C8V38">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Whosoever therefore shall be ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation;
of him also shall the Son of man be ashamed, when he cometh in the glory of his Father with the holy
angels.</span></div>
