 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C3V1">&nbsp;</a>A prayer of Habakkuk the prophet upon Shigionoth.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C3V2">&nbsp;</a>O LORD, I have heard thy speech,
<span class="add">and</span> was afraid: O LORD, revive thy work in the midst of the years, in the midst of the years make known;
in wrath remember mercy.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C3V3">&nbsp;</a>God came from Teman, and the Holy One from mount Paran. Selah. His glory covered the heavens, and the
earth was full of his praise.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C3V4">&nbsp;</a>And
<span class="add">his</span> brightness was as the light; he had horns
<span class="add">coming
</span> out of his hand: and there
<span class="add">was</span> the hiding of his power.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C3V5">&nbsp;</a>Before him went the pestilence, and burning coals went forth at his feet.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C3V6">&nbsp;</a>He stood, and measured the earth: he beheld, and drove asunder the nations; and the everlasting mountains
were scattered, the perpetual hills did bow: his ways
<span class="add">are</span> everlasting.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C3V7">&nbsp;</a>I saw the tents of Cushan in affliction:
<span class="add">and</span> the curtains of the land of Midian did tremble.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C3V8">&nbsp;</a>Was the LORD displeased against the rivers?
<span class="add">was</span> thine anger against the rivers?
<span class="add">was</span> thy wrath against the sea, that thou didst ride upon thine horses
<span class="add">and</span> thy chariots of salvation?
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C3V9">&nbsp;</a>Thy bow was made quite naked,
<span class="add">according</span> to the oaths of the tribes,
<span class="add">even thy</span> word. Selah. Thou didst cleave the earth with rivers.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C3V10">&nbsp;</a>The mountains saw thee,
<span class="add">and</span> they trembled: the overflowing of the water passed by: the deep uttered his voice,
<span class="add">and</span> lifted up his hands on high.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C3V11">&nbsp;</a>The sun
<span class="add">and</span> moon stood still in their habitation: at the light of thine arrows they went,
<span class="add">and</span> at the shining of thy glittering spear.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C3V12">&nbsp;</a>Thou didst march through the land in indignation, thou didst thresh the heathen in anger.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C3V13">&nbsp;</a>Thou wentest forth for the salvation of thy people,
<span class="add">even
</span> for salvation with thine anointed; thou woundedst the head out of the house of the wicked, by discovering
the foundation unto the neck. Selah.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C3V14">&nbsp;</a>Thou didst strike through with his staves the head of his villages: they came out as a whirlwind to scatter
me: their rejoicing
<span class="add">was</span> as to devour the poor secretly.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C3V15">&nbsp;</a>Thou didst walk through the sea with thine horses,
<span class="add">through
</span> the heap of great waters.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C3V16">&nbsp;</a>When I heard, my belly trembled; my lips quivered at the voice: rottenness entered into my bones, and
I trembled in myself, that I might rest in the day of trouble: when he cometh up unto the people, he
will invade them with his troops.

<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C3V17">&nbsp;</a>Although the fig tree shall not blossom, neither
<span class="add">shall</span> fruit
<span class="add">be</span> in the vines; the labour of the olive shall fail, and the fields shall yield no meat; the flock shall
be cut off from the fold, and
<span class="add">there shall be</span> no herd in the stalls:
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C3V18">&nbsp;</a>Yet I will rejoice in the LORD, I will joy in the God of my salvation.
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C3V19">&nbsp;</a>The LORD God
<span class="add">is</span> my strength, and he will make my feet like hinds’
<span class="add">feet,</span> and he will make me to walk upon mine high places. To the chief singer on my stringed instruments.
