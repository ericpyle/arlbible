 <span class="verse" id="V1">1&nbsp;</span>A prayer of Habakkuk the prophet upon Shigionoth.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span>O LORD, I have heard thy speech, <span class='add'>and</span> was afraid: O LORD, revive thy work in the midst of the years, in the midst of the years make known; in wrath remember mercy.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>God came from Teman, and the Holy One from mount Paran. Selah. His glory covered the heavens, and the earth was full of his praise.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>And <span class='add'>his</span> brightness was as the light; he had horns <span class='add'>coming</span> out of his hand: and there <span class='add'>was</span> the hiding of his power.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>Before him went the pestilence, and burning coals went forth at his feet.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>He stood, and measured the earth: he beheld, and drove asunder the nations; and the everlasting mountains were scattered, the perpetual hills did bow: his ways <span class='add'>are</span> everlasting.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>I saw the tents of Cushan in affliction: <span class='add'>and</span> the curtains of the land of Midian did tremble.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>Was the LORD displeased against the rivers? <span class='add'>was</span> thine anger against the rivers? <span class='add'>was</span> thy wrath against the sea, that thou didst ride upon thine horses <span class='add'>and</span> thy chariots of salvation?  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>Thy bow was made quite naked, <span class='add'>according</span> to the oaths of the tribes, <span class='add'>even thy</span> word. Selah. Thou didst cleave the earth with rivers.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>The mountains saw thee, <span class='add'>and</span> they trembled: the overflowing of the water passed by: the deep uttered his voice, <span class='add'>and</span> lifted up his hands on high.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>The sun <span class='add'>and</span> moon stood still in their habitation: at the light of thine arrows they went, <span class='add'>and</span> at the shining of thy glittering spear.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>Thou didst march through the land in indignation, thou didst thresh the heathen in anger.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>Thou wentest forth for the salvation of thy people, <span class='add'>even</span> for salvation with thine anointed; thou woundedst the head out of the house of the wicked, by discovering the foundation unto the neck. Selah.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>Thou didst strike through with his staves the head of his villages: they came out as a whirlwind to scatter me: their rejoicing <span class='add'>was</span> as to devour the poor secretly.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>Thou didst walk through the sea with thine horses, <span class='add'>through</span> the heap of great waters.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>When I heard, my belly trembled; my lips quivered at the voice: rottenness entered into my bones, and I trembled in myself, that I might rest in the day of trouble: when he cometh up unto the people, he will invade them with his troops. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>Although the fig tree shall not blossom, neither <span class='add'>shall</span> fruit <span class='add'>be</span> in the vines; the labour of the olive shall fail, and the fields shall yield no meat; the flock shall be cut off from the fold, and <span class='add'>there shall be</span> no herd in the stalls:  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>Yet I will rejoice in the LORD, I will joy in the God of my salvation.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>The LORD God <span class='add'>is</span> my strength, and he will make my feet like hinds’ <span class='add'>feet</span>, and he will make me to walk upon mine high places. To the chief singer on my stringed instruments. </div><ul class='tnav'>
