 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C17V1">&nbsp;</a>These words spake Jesus, and lifted up his eyes to heaven, and said,
<span class="wj">Father, the hour is come; glorify thy Son, that thy Son also may glorify thee:
</span> <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C17V2">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">As thou hast given him power over all flesh, that he should give eternal life to as many as thou hast
given him.
</span> <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C17V3">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast
sent.
</span> <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C17V4">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">I have glorified thee on the earth: I have finished the work which thou gavest me to do.
</span> <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C17V5">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And now, O Father, glorify thou me with thine own self with the glory which I had with thee before the
world was.
</span> <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C17V6">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">I have manifested thy name unto the men which thou gavest me out of the world: thine they were, and thou
gavest them me; and they have kept thy word.
</span> <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C17V7">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Now they have known that all things whatsoever thou hast given me are of thee.
</span> <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C17V8">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">For I have given unto them the words which thou gavest me; and they have received
them, and have known surely that I came out from thee, and they have believed that thou didst send me.
</span> <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C17V9">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">I pray for them: I pray not for the world, but for them which thou hast given me; for they are thine.
</span> <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C17V10">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And all mine are thine, and thine are mine; and I am glorified in them.
</span> <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C17V11">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And now I am no more in the world, but these are in the world, and I come to thee. Holy Father, keep
through thine own name those whom thou hast given me, that they may be one, as we
are.
</span> <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C17V12">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">While I was with them in the world, I kept them in thy name: those that thou gavest me I have kept, and
none of them is lost, but the son of perdition; that the scripture might be fulfilled.
</span> <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C17V13">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And now come I to thee; and these things I speak in the world, that they might have my joy fulfilled
in themselves.
</span> <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C17V14">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">I have given them thy word; and the world hath hated them, because they are not of the world, even as
I am not of the world.
</span> <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C17V15">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">I pray not that thou shouldest take them out of the world, but that thou shouldest keep them from the
evil.
</span> <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C17V16">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">They are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.
</span> <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C17V17">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Sanctify them through thy truth: thy word is truth.
</span> <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C17V18">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">As thou hast sent me into the world, even so have I also sent them into the world.
</span> <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C17V19">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And for their sakes I sanctify myself, that they also might be sanctified through the truth.
</span> <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C17V20">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Neither pray I for these alone, but for them also which shall believe on me through their word;
</span> <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C17V21">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">That they all may be one; as thou, Father,
art in me, and I in thee, that they also may be one in us: that the world may believe that thou hast sent
me.
</span> <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C17V22">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And the glory which thou gavest me I have given them; that they may be one, even as we are one:
</span> <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C17V23">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">I in them, and thou in me, that they may be made perfect in one; and that the world may know that thou
hast sent me, and hast loved them, as thou hast loved me.
</span> <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C17V24">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Father, I will that they also, whom thou hast given me, be with me where I am; that they may behold my
glory, which thou hast given me: for thou lovedst me before the foundation of the world.
</span> <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C17V25">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">O righteous Father, the world hath not known thee: but I have known thee, and these have known that thou
hast sent me.
</span> <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C17V26">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And I have declared unto them thy name, and will declare
it: that the love wherewith thou hast loved me may be in them, and I in them.</span></div>
