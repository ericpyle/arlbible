<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C7V2">&nbsp;</a>Did very carefully oversee the holy works, assisting the ancients of the Jews and governors of the temple.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C7V3">&nbsp;</a>And so the holy works prospered, when Aggeus and Zacharias the prophets prophesied.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C7V4">&nbsp;</a>And they finished these things by the commandment of the Lord God of Israel, and with the consent of
Cyrus, Darius, and Artexerxes, kings of Persia.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C7V5">&nbsp;</a>And thus was the holy house finished in the three and twentieth day of the month Adar, in the sixth year

</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C7V6">&nbsp;</a>And the children of Israel, the priests, and the Levites, and others that were of the captivity, that

together.
