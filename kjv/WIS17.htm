 <span class="verse" id="V1">1&nbsp;</span>For great are thy judgments, and cannot be expressed: therefore unnurtured souls have erred. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span>For when unrighteous men thought to oppress the holy nation; they being shut up in their houses, the prisoners of darkness, and fettered with the bonds of a long night, lay <span class='add'>there</span> exiled from the eternal providence. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>For while they supposed to lie hid in their secret sins, they were scattered under a dark veil of forgetfulness, being horribly astonished, and troubled with <span class='add'>strange</span> apparitions. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>For neither might the corner that held them keep them from fear: but noises <span class='add'>as of waters</span> falling down sounded about them, and sad visions appeared unto them with heavy countenances. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>No power of the fire might give them light: neither could the bright flames of the stars endure to lighten that horrible night. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>Only there appeared unto them a fire kindled of itself, very dreadful: for being much terrified, they thought the things which they saw to be worse than the sight they saw not. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>As for the illusions of art magick, they were put down, and their vaunting in wisdom was reproved with disgrace. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>For they, that promised to drive away terrors and troubles from a sick soul, were sick themselves of fear, worthy to be laughed at. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>For though no terrible thing did fear them; yet being scared with beasts that passed by, and hissing of serpents, </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>They died for fear, denying that they saw the air, which could of no side be avoided. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>For wickedness, condemned by her own witness, is very timorous, and being pressed with conscience, always forecasteth grievous things. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>For fear is nothing else but a betraying of the succours which reason offereth. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>And the expectation from within, being less, counteth the ignorance more than the cause which bringeth the torment. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>But they sleeping the same sleep that night, which was indeed intolerable, and which came upon them out of the bottoms of inevitable hell, </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>Were partly vexed with monstrous apparitions, and partly fainted, their heart failing them: for a sudden fear, and not looked for, came upon them. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>So then whosoever there fell down was straitly kept, shut up in a prison without iron bars, </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>For whether he were husbandman, or shepherd, or a labourer in the field, he was overtaken, and endured that necessity, which could not be avoided: for they were all bound with one chain of darkness. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>Whether it were a whistling wind, or a melodious noise of birds among the spreading branches, or a pleasing fall of water running violently, </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>Or a terrible sound of stones cast down, or a running that could not be seen of skipping beasts, or a roaring voice of most savage wild beasts, or a rebounding echo from the hollow mountains; these things made them to swoon for fear. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>For the whole world shined with clear light, and none were hindered in their labour: </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>Over them only was spread an heavy night, an image of that darkness which should afterward receive them: but yet were they unto themselves more grievous than the darkness. </div><ul class='tnav'>
