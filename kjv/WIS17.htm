<div><a name="C17V0"><hr></a>
<div class="chapterlabel"> 17</div><div class="p">
 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C17V1">&nbsp;</a>For great are thy judgments, and cannot be expressed: therefore unnurtured souls have erred.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C17V2">&nbsp;</a>For when unrighteous men thought to oppress the holy nation; they being shut up in their houses, the
prisoners of darkness, and fettered with the bonds of a long night, lay
<span class="add">there</span> exiled from the eternal providence.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C17V3">&nbsp;</a>For while they supposed to lie hid in their secret sins, they were scattered under a dark veil of forgetfulness,
being horribly astonished, and troubled with
<span class="add">strange</span> apparitions.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C17V4">&nbsp;</a>For neither might the corner that held them keep them from fear: but noises
<span class="add">as of waters</span> falling down sounded about them, and sad visions appeared unto them with heavy countenances.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C17V5">&nbsp;</a>No power of the fire might give them light: neither could the bright flames of the stars endure to lighten
that horrible night.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C17V6">&nbsp;</a>Only there appeared unto them a fire kindled of itself, very dreadful: for being much terrified, they
thought the things which they saw to be worse than the sight they saw not.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C17V7">&nbsp;</a>As for the illusions of art magick, they were put down, and their vaunting in wisdom was reproved with
disgrace.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C17V8">&nbsp;</a>For they, that promised to drive away terrors and troubles from a sick soul, were sick themselves of
fear, worthy to be laughed at.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C17V9">&nbsp;</a>For though no terrible thing did fear them; yet being scared with beasts that passed by, and hissing
of serpents,
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C17V10">&nbsp;</a>They died for fear, denying that they saw the air, which could of no side be avoided.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C17V11">&nbsp;</a>For wickedness, condemned by her own witness, is very timorous, and being pressed with conscience, always
forecasteth grievous things.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C17V12">&nbsp;</a>For fear is nothing else but a betraying of the succours which reason offereth.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C17V13">&nbsp;</a>And the expectation from within, being less, counteth the ignorance more than the cause which bringeth
the torment.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C17V14">&nbsp;</a>But they sleeping the same sleep that night, which was indeed intolerable, and which came upon them out
of the bottoms of inevitable hell,
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C17V15">&nbsp;</a>Were partly vexed with monstrous apparitions, and partly fainted, their heart failing them: for a sudden
fear, and not looked for, came upon them.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C17V16">&nbsp;</a>So then whosoever there fell down was straitly kept, shut up in a prison without iron bars,
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C17V17">&nbsp;</a>For whether he were husbandman, or shepherd, or a labourer in the field, he was overtaken, and endured
that necessity, which could not be avoided: for they were all bound with one chain of darkness.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C17V18">&nbsp;</a>Whether it were a whistling wind, or a melodious noise of birds among the spreading branches, or a pleasing
fall of water running violently,
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C17V19">&nbsp;</a>Or a terrible sound of stones cast down, or a running that could not be seen of skipping beasts, or a
roaring voice of most savage wild beasts, or a rebounding echo from the hollow mountains; these things
made them to swoon for fear.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C17V20">&nbsp;</a>For the whole world shined with clear light, and none were hindered in their labour:
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C17V21">&nbsp;</a>Over them only was spread an heavy night, an image of that darkness which should afterward receive them:
but yet were they unto themselves more grievous than the darkness.
