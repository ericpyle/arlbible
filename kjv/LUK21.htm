 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C21V1">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And he looked up, and saw the rich men casting their gifts into the treasury.
</span> <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C21V2">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And he saw also a certain poor widow casting in thither two mites.
</span> <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C21V3">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And he said, Of a truth I say unto you, that this poor widow hath cast in more than they all:
</span> <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C21V4">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">For all these have of their abundance cast in unto the offerings of God: but she of her penury hath cast
in all the living that she had.
</span></div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C21V5">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And as some spake of the temple, how it was adorned with goodly stones and gifts, he said,
</span> <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C21V6">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj"></span><span class="add">As for</span><span class="wj"> these things which ye behold, the days will come, in the which there shall not be left one stone upon
another, that shall not be thrown down.
</span> <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C21V7">&nbsp;</a>And they asked him, saying, Master, but when shall these things be? and what sign
<span class="add">will there be</span> when these things shall come to pass?
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C21V8">&nbsp;</a>And he said,
<span class="wj">Take heed that ye be not deceived: for many shall come in my name, saying, I am
</span><span class="add">Christ;</span><span class="wj"> and the time draweth near: go ye not therefore after them.
</span> <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C21V9">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">But when ye shall hear of wars and commotions, be not terrified: for these things must first come to
pass; but the end
</span><span class="add">is</span><span class="wj"> not by and by.
</span> <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C21V10">&nbsp;</a>Then said he unto them,
<span class="wj">Nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom:
</span> <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C21V11">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And great earthquakes shall be in divers places, and famines, and pestilences; and fearful sights and
great signs shall there be from heaven.
</span> <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C21V12">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">But before all these, they shall lay their hands on you, and persecute
</span><span class="add">you,</span><span class="wj"> delivering
</span><span class="add">you</span><span class="wj"> up to the synagogues, and into prisons, being brought before kings and rulers for my name’s sake.
</span> <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C21V13">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And it shall turn to you for a testimony.
</span> <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C21V14">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Settle
</span><span class="add">it</span><span class="wj"> therefore in your hearts, not to meditate before what ye shall answer:
</span> <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C21V15">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">For I will give you a mouth and wisdom, which all your adversaries shall not be able to gainsay nor resist.
</span> <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C21V16">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And ye shall be betrayed both by parents, and brethren, and kinsfolks, and friends; and
</span><span class="add">some</span><span class="wj"> of you shall they cause to be put to death.
</span> <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C21V17">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And ye shall be hated of all
</span><span class="add">men</span><span class="wj"> for my name’s sake.
</span> <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C21V18">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">But there shall not an hair of your head perish.
</span> <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C21V19">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">In your patience possess ye your souls.
</span> <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C21V20">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And when ye shall see Jerusalem compassed with armies, then know that the desolation thereof is nigh.
</span> <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C21V21">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Then let them which are in Judaea flee to the mountains; and let them which are in the midst of it depart
out; and let not them that are in the countries enter thereinto.
</span> <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C21V22">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">For these be the days of vengeance, that all things which are written may be fulfilled.
</span> <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C21V23">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">But woe unto them that are with child, and to them that give suck, in those days! for there shall be
great distress in the land, and wrath upon this people.
</span> <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C21V24">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And they shall fall by the edge of the sword, and shall be led away captive into all nations: and Jerusalem
shall be trodden down of the Gentiles, until the times of the Gentiles be fulfilled.</span></div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C21V25">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And there shall be signs in the sun, and in the moon, and in the stars; and upon the earth distress of
nations, with perplexity; the sea and the waves roaring;
</span> <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C21V26">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Men’s hearts failing them for fear, and for looking after those things which are coming on the earth:
for the powers of heaven shall be shaken.
</span> <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C21V27">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And then shall they see the Son of man coming in a cloud with power and great glory.
</span> <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C21V28">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And when these things begin to come to pass, then look up, and lift up your heads; for your redemption
draweth nigh.
</span> <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C21V29">&nbsp;</a>And he spake to them a parable;
<span class="wj">Behold the fig tree, and all the trees;
</span> <span class="verse"> 30</span><a name="C21V30">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">When they now shoot forth, ye see and know of your own selves that summer is now nigh at hand.
</span> <span class="verse"> 31</span><a name="C21V31">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">So likewise ye, when ye see these things come to pass, know ye that the kingdom of God is nigh at hand.
</span> <span class="verse"> 32</span><a name="C21V32">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Verily I say unto you, This generation shall not pass away, till all be fulfilled.
</span> <span class="verse"> 33</span><a name="C21V33">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Heaven and earth shall pass away: but my words shall not pass away.
</span></div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 34</span><a name="C21V34">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And take heed to yourselves, lest at any time your hearts be overcharged with surfeiting, and drunkenness,
and cares of this life, and so that day come upon you unawares.
</span> <span class="verse"> 35</span><a name="C21V35">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">For as a snare shall it come on all them that dwell on the face of the whole earth.
</span> <span class="verse"> 36</span><a name="C21V36">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Watch ye therefore, and pray always, that ye may be accounted worthy to escape all these things that
shall come to pass, and to stand before the Son of man.
</span> <span class="verse"> 37</span><a name="C21V37">&nbsp;</a>And in the day time he was teaching in the temple; and at night he went out, and abode in the mount that
is called
<span class="add">the mount</span> of Olives.
 <span class="verse"> 38</span><a name="C21V38">&nbsp;</a>And all the people came early in the morning to him in the temple, for to hear him.
