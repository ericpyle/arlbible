 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C1V1">&nbsp;</a>Now in the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, that the word of the LORD by the mouth of Jeremiah might
be fulfilled, the LORD stirred up the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia, that he made a proclamation throughout
all his kingdom, and
<span class="add">put it</span> also in writing, saying,
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C1V2">&nbsp;</a>Thus saith Cyrus king of Persia, The LORD God of heaven hath given me all the kingdoms of the earth;
and he hath charged me to build him an house at Jerusalem, which
<span class="add">is</span> in Judah.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C1V3">&nbsp;</a>Who
<span class="add">is there</span> among you of all his people? his God be with him, and let him go up to Jerusalem, which is in Judah,
and build the house of the LORD God of Israel, (he
<span class="add">is</span> the God,) which
<span class="add">is</span> in Jerusalem.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C1V4">&nbsp;</a>And whosoever remaineth in any place where he sojourneth, let the men of his place help him with silver,
and with gold, and with goods, and with beasts, beside the freewill offering for the house of God that
<span class="add">is</span> in Jerusalem.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C1V5">&nbsp;</a>Then rose up the chief of the fathers of Judah and Benjamin, and the priests, and the Levites, with all
<span class="add">them</span> whose spirit God had raised, to go up to build the house of the LORD which
<span class="add">is</span> in Jerusalem.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C1V6">&nbsp;</a>And all they that
<span class="add">were</span> about them strengthened their hands with vessels of silver, with gold, with goods, and with beasts,
and with precious things, beside all
<span class="add">that</span> was willingly offered.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C1V7">&nbsp;</a>Also Cyrus the king brought forth the vessels of the house of the LORD, which Nebuchadnezzar had brought
forth out of Jerusalem, and had put them in the house of his gods;
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C1V8">&nbsp;</a>Even those did Cyrus king of Persia bring forth by the hand of Mithredath the treasurer, and numbered
them unto Sheshbazzar, the prince of Judah.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C1V9">&nbsp;</a>And this
<span class="add">is</span> the number of them: thirty chargers of gold, a thousand chargers of silver, nine and twenty knives,
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C1V10">&nbsp;</a>Thirty basons of gold, silver basons of a second
<span class="add">sort</span> four hundred and ten,
<span class="add">and</span> other vessels a thousand.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C1V11">&nbsp;</a>All the vessels of gold and of silver
<span class="add">were</span> five thousand and four hundred. All
<span class="add">these</span> did Sheshbazzar bring up with
<span class="add">them of</span> the captivity that were brought up from Babylon unto Jerusalem.
