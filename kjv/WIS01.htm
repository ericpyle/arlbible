<div class="mt1">The Book of Wisdom or The Wisdom of Solomon
</div>
<div class="chapterlabel"> 1</div><div class="p">
 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C1V1">&nbsp;</a>Love righteousness, ye that be judges of the earth: think of the Lord with a good (heart,) and in simplicity
of heart seek him.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C1V2">&nbsp;</a>For he will be found of them that tempt him not; and sheweth himself unto such as do not distrust him.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C1V3">&nbsp;</a>For froward thoughts separate from God: and his power, when it is tried, reproveth the unwise.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C1V4">&nbsp;</a>For into a malicious soul wisdom shall not enter; nor dwell in the body that is subject unto sin.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C1V5">&nbsp;</a>For the holy spirit of discipline will flee deceit, and remove from thoughts that are without understanding,
and will not abide when unrighteousness cometh in.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C1V6">&nbsp;</a>For wisdom is a loving spirit; and will not acquit a blasphemer of his words: for God is witness of his
reins, and a true beholder of his heart, and a hearer of his tongue.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C1V7">&nbsp;</a>For the Spirit of the Lord filleth the world: and that which containeth all things hath knowledge of
the voice.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C1V8">&nbsp;</a>Therefore he that speaketh unrighteous things cannot be hid: neither shall vengeance, when it punisheth,
pass by him.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C1V9">&nbsp;</a>For inquisition shall be made into the counsels of the ungodly: and the sound of his words shall come
unto the Lord for the manifestation of his wicked deeds.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C1V10">&nbsp;</a>For the ear of jealousy heareth all things: and the noise of murmurings is not hid.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C1V11">&nbsp;</a>Therefore beware of murmuring, which is unprofitable; and refrain your tongue from backbiting: for there
is no word so secret, that shall go for nought: and the mouth that belieth slayeth the soul.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C1V12">&nbsp;</a>Seek not death in the error of your life: and pull not upon yourselves destruction with the works of
your hands.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C1V13">&nbsp;</a>For God made not death: neither hath he pleasure in the destruction of the living.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C1V14">&nbsp;</a>For he created all things, that they might have their being: and the generations of the world were healthful;
and there is no poison of destruction in them, nor the kingdom of death upon the earth:
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C1V15">&nbsp;</a>(For righteousness is immortal:)
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C1V16">&nbsp;</a>But ungodly men with their works and words called it to them: for when they thought to have it their
friend, they consumed to nought, and made a covenant with it, because they are worthy to take part with
it.
