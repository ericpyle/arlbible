 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C3V1">&nbsp;</a>Moreover he said unto me, Son of man, eat that thou findest; eat this roll, and go speak unto the house
of Israel.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C3V2">&nbsp;</a>So I opened my mouth, and he caused me to eat that roll.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C3V3">&nbsp;</a>And he said unto me, Son of man, cause thy belly to eat, and fill thy bowels with this roll that I give
thee. Then did I eat
<span class="add">it;</span> and it was in my mouth as honey for sweetness.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C3V4">&nbsp;</a>And he said unto me, Son of man, go, get thee unto the house of Israel, and speak with my words unto
them.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C3V5">&nbsp;</a>For thou
<span class="add">art</span> not sent to a people of a strange speech and of an hard language,
<span class="add">but</span> to the house of Israel;
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C3V6">&nbsp;</a>Not to many people of a strange speech and of an hard language, whose words thou canst not understand.
Surely, had I sent thee to them, they would have hearkened unto thee.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C3V7">&nbsp;</a>But the house of Israel will not hearken unto thee; for they will not hearken unto me: for all the house
of Israel
<span class="add">are</span> impudent and hardhearted.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C3V8">&nbsp;</a>Behold, I have made thy face strong against their faces, and thy forehead strong against their foreheads.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C3V9">&nbsp;</a>As an adamant harder than flint have I made thy forehead: fear them not, neither be dismayed at their
looks, though they
<span class="add">be</span> a rebellious house.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C3V10">&nbsp;</a>Moreover he said unto me, Son of man, all my words that I shall speak unto thee receive in thine heart,
and hear with thine ears.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C3V11">&nbsp;</a>And go, get thee to them of the captivity, unto the children of thy people, and speak unto them, and
tell them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C3V12">&nbsp;</a>Then the spirit took me up, and I heard behind me a voice of a great rushing,
<span class="add">saying,</span> Blessed
<span class="add">be</span> the glory of the LORD from his place.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C3V13">&nbsp;</a><span class="add">I heard</span> also the noise of the wings of the living creatures that touched one another, and the noise of the wheels
over against them, and a noise of a great rushing.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C3V14">&nbsp;</a>So the spirit lifted me up, and took me away, and I went in bitterness, in the heat of my spirit; but
the hand of the LORD was strong upon me.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C3V15">&nbsp;</a>Then I came to them of the captivity at Tel-abib, that dwelt by the river of Chebar, and I sat where
they sat, and remained there astonished among them seven days.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C3V16">&nbsp;</a>And it came to pass at the end of seven days, that the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C3V17">&nbsp;</a>Son of man, I have made thee a watchman unto the house of Israel: therefore hear the word at my mouth,
and give them warning from me.
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C3V18">&nbsp;</a>When I say unto the wicked, Thou shalt surely die; and thou givest him not warning, nor speakest to warn
the wicked from his wicked way, to save his life; the same wicked
<span class="add">man</span> shall die in his iniquity; but his blood will I require at thine hand.
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C3V19">&nbsp;</a>Yet if thou warn the wicked, and he turn not from his wickedness, nor from his wicked way, he shall die
in his iniquity; but thou hast delivered thy soul.
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C3V20">&nbsp;</a>Again, When a righteous
<span class="add">man</span> doth turn from his righteousness, and commit iniquity, and I lay a stumblingblock before him, he shall
die: because thou hast not given him warning, he shall die in his sin, and his righteousness which he
hath done shall not be remembered; but his blood will I require at thine hand.
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C3V21">&nbsp;</a>Nevertheless if thou warn the righteous
<span class="add">man,</span> that the righteous sin not, and he doth not sin, he shall surely live, because he is warned; also thou
hast delivered thy soul.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C3V22">&nbsp;</a>And the hand of the LORD was there upon me; and he said unto me, Arise, go forth into the plain, and
I will there talk with thee.
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C3V23">&nbsp;</a>Then I arose, and went forth into the plain: and, behold, the glory of the LORD stood there, as the glory
which I saw by the river of Chebar: and I fell on my face.
 <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C3V24">&nbsp;</a>Then the spirit entered into me, and set me upon my feet, and spake with me, and said unto me, Go, shut
thyself within thine house.
 <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C3V25">&nbsp;</a>But thou, O son of man, behold, they shall put bands upon thee, and shall bind thee with them, and thou
shalt not go out among them:
 <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C3V26">&nbsp;</a>And I will make thy tongue cleave to the roof of thy mouth, that thou shalt be dumb, and shalt not be
to them a reprover: for they
<span class="add">are</span> a rebellious house.
 <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C3V27">&nbsp;</a>But when I speak with thee, I will open thy mouth, and thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the Lord
GOD; He that heareth, let him hear; and he that forbeareth, let him forbear: for they
<span class="add">are</span> a rebellious house.
