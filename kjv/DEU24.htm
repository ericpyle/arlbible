 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C24V4">&nbsp;</a>Her former husband, which sent her away, may not take her again to be his wife, after that she is defiled;

</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C24V6">&nbsp;</a>No man shall take the nether or the upper millstone to pledge: for he taketh

</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C24V7">&nbsp;</a>If a man be found stealing any of his brethren of the children of Israel, and maketh merchandise of him,

 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C24V12">&nbsp;</a>And if the man
<span class="add">be</span> poor, thou shalt not sleep with his pledge:
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C24V13">&nbsp;</a>In any case thou shalt deliver him the pledge again when the sun goeth down, that he may sleep in his

</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C24V14">&nbsp;</a>Thou shalt not oppress an hired servant
<span class="add">that is</span> poor and needy,

<span class="add">is</span> poor, and setteth his heart upon it: lest he cry against thee unto the LORD, and it be sin unto thee.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C24V16">&nbsp;</a>The fathers shall not be put to death for the children, neither shall the children be put to death for
