 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C11V1">&nbsp;</a>After these things Tobias went his way, praising God that he had given him a prosperous journey, and
blessed Raguel and Edna his wife, and went on his way till they drew near unto Nineve.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C11V2">&nbsp;</a>Then Raphael said to Tobias, Thou knowest, brother, how thou didst leave thy father:
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C11V3">&nbsp;</a>Let us haste before thy wife, and prepare the house.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C11V4">&nbsp;</a>And take in thine hand the gall of the fish. So they went their way, and the dog went after them.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C11V5">&nbsp;</a>Now Anna sat looking about toward the way for her son.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C11V6">&nbsp;</a>And when she espied him coming, she said to his father, Behold, thy son cometh, and the man that went
with him.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C11V7">&nbsp;</a>Then said Raphael, I know, Tobias, that thy father will open his eyes.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C11V8">&nbsp;</a>Therefore anoint thou his eyes with the gall, and being pricked therewith, he shall rub, and the whiteness
shall fall away, and he shall see thee.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C11V9">&nbsp;</a>Then Anna ran forth, and fell upon the neck of her son, and said unto him, Seeing I have seen thee, my
son, from henceforth I am content to die. And they wept both.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C11V10">&nbsp;</a>Tobit also went forth toward the door, and stumbled: but his son ran unto him,
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C11V11">&nbsp;</a>And took hold of his father: and he strake of the gall on his fathers’ eyes, saying, Be of good hope,
my father.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C11V12">&nbsp;</a>And when his eyes began to smart, he rubbed them;
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C11V13">&nbsp;</a>And the whiteness pilled away from the corners of his eyes: and when he saw his son, he fell upon his
neck.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C11V14">&nbsp;</a>And he wept, and said, Blessed art thou, O God, and blessed is thy name for ever; and blessed are all
thine holy angels:
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C11V15">&nbsp;</a>For thou hast scourged, and hast taken pity on me: for, behold, I see my son Tobias. And his son went
in rejoicing, and told his father the great things that had happened to him in Media.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C11V16">&nbsp;</a>Then Tobit went out to meet his daughter in law at the gate of Nineve, rejoicing and praising God: and
they which saw him go marvelled, because he had received his sight.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C11V17">&nbsp;</a>But Tobias gave thanks before them, because God had mercy on him. And when he came near to Sara his daughter
in law, he blessed her, saying, Thou art welcome, daughter: God be blessed, which hath brought thee unto
us, and blessed be thy father and thy mother. And there was joy among all his brethren which were at
Nineve.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C11V18">&nbsp;</a>And Achiacharus, and Nasbas his brother’s son, came:
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C11V19">&nbsp;</a>And Tobias’ wedding was kept seven days with great joy.
