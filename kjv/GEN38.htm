 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C38V1">&nbsp;</a>And it came to pass at that time, that Judah went down from his brethren, and turned in to a certain
Adullamite, whose name
<span class="add">was</span> Hirah.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C38V2">&nbsp;</a>And Judah saw there a daughter of a certain Canaanite, whose name
<span class="add">was</span> Shuah; and he took her, and went in unto her.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C38V3">&nbsp;</a>And she conceived, and bare a son; and he called his name Er.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C38V4">&nbsp;</a>And she conceived again, and bare a son; and she called his name Onan.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C38V5">&nbsp;</a>And she yet again conceived, and bare a son; and called his name Shelah: and he was at Chezib, when she
bare him.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C38V6">&nbsp;</a>And Judah took a wife for Er his firstborn, whose name
<span class="add">was</span> Tamar.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C38V7">&nbsp;</a>And Er, Judah’s firstborn, was wicked in the sight of the LORD; and the LORD slew him.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C38V8">&nbsp;</a>And Judah said unto Onan, Go in unto thy brother’s wife, and marry her, and raise up seed to thy brother.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C38V9">&nbsp;</a>And Onan knew that the seed should not be his; and it came to pass, when he went in unto his brother’s
wife, that he spilled
<span class="add">it</span> on the ground, lest that he should give seed to his brother.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C38V10">&nbsp;</a>And the thing which he did displeased the LORD: wherefore he slew him also.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C38V11">&nbsp;</a>Then said Judah to Tamar his daughter in law, Remain a widow at thy father’s house, till Shelah my son
be grown: for he said, Lest peradventure he die also, as his brethren
<span class="add">did.</span> And Tamar went and dwelt in her father’s house.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C38V12">&nbsp;</a>And in process of time the daughter of Shuah Judah’s wife died; and Judah was comforted, and went up
unto his sheepshearers to Timnath, he and his friend Hirah the Adullamite.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C38V13">&nbsp;</a>And it was told Tamar, saying, Behold thy father in law goeth up to Timnath to shear his sheep.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C38V14">&nbsp;</a>And she put her widow’s garments off from her, and covered her with a vail, and wrapped herself, and
sat in an open place, which
<span class="add">is</span> by the way to Timnath; for she saw that Shelah was grown, and she was not given unto him to wife.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C38V15">&nbsp;</a>When Judah saw her, he thought her
<span class="add">to be</span> an harlot; because she had covered her face.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C38V16">&nbsp;</a>And he turned unto her by the way, and said, Go to, I pray thee, let me come in unto thee; (for he knew
not that she
<span class="add">was</span> his daughter in law.) And she said, What wilt thou give me, that thou mayest come in unto me?
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C38V17">&nbsp;</a>And he said, I will send
<span class="add">thee</span> a kid from the flock. And she said, Wilt thou give
<span class="add">me</span> a pledge, till thou send
<span class="add">it?
</span> <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C38V18">&nbsp;</a>And he said, What pledge shall I give thee? And she said, Thy signet, and thy bracelets, and thy staff
that
<span class="add">is</span> in thine hand. And he gave
<span class="add">it</span> her, and came in unto her, and she conceived by him.
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C38V19">&nbsp;</a>And she arose, and went away, and laid by her vail from her, and put on the garments of her widowhood.
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C38V20">&nbsp;</a>And Judah sent the kid by the hand of his friend the Adullamite, to receive
<span class="add">his</span> pledge from the woman’s hand: but he found her not.
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C38V21">&nbsp;</a>Then he asked the men of that place, saying, Where
<span class="add">is</span> the harlot, that
<span class="add">was</span> openly by the way side? And they said, There was no harlot in this
<span class="add">place.
</span> <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C38V22">&nbsp;</a>And he returned to Judah, and said, I cannot find her; and also the men of the place said,
<span class="add">that</span> there was no harlot in this
<span class="add">place.
</span> <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C38V23">&nbsp;</a>And Judah said, Let her take
<span class="add">it</span> to her, lest we be shamed: behold, I sent this kid, and thou hast not found her.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C38V24">&nbsp;</a>And it came to pass about three months after, that it was told Judah, saying, Tamar thy daughter in law
hath played the harlot; and also, behold, she
<span class="add">is</span> with child by whoredom. And Judah said, Bring her forth, and let her be burnt.
 <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C38V25">&nbsp;</a>When she
<span class="add">was</span> brought forth, she sent to her father in law, saying, By the man, whose these
<span class="add">are, am</span> I with child: and she said, Discern, I pray thee, whose
<span class="add">are</span> these, the signet, and bracelets, and staff.
 <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C38V26">&nbsp;</a>And Judah acknowledged
<span class="add">them,</span> and said, She hath been more righteous than I; because that I gave her not to Shelah my son. And he
knew her again no more.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C38V27">&nbsp;</a>And it came to pass in the time of her travail, that, behold, twins
<span class="add">were</span> in her womb.
 <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C38V28">&nbsp;</a>And it came to pass, when she travailed, that
<span class="add">the one</span> put out
<span class="add">his</span> hand: and the midwife took and bound upon his hand a scarlet thread, saying, This came out first,
 <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C38V29">&nbsp;</a>And it came to pass, as he drew back his hand, that, behold, his brother came out: and she said, How
hast thou broken forth?
<span class="add">this</span> breach
<span class="add">be</span> upon thee: therefore his name was called Pharez.
 <span class="verse"> 30</span><a name="C38V30">&nbsp;</a>And afterward came out his brother, that had the scarlet thread upon his hand: and his name was called
Zarah.
