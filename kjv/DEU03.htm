 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C3V1">&nbsp;</a>Then we turned, and went up the way to Bashan: and Og the king of Bashan came out against us, he and
all his people, to battle at Edrei.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C3V2">&nbsp;</a>And the LORD said unto me, Fear him not: for I will deliver him, and all his people, and his land, into
thy hand; and thou shalt do unto him as thou didst unto Sihon king of the Amorites, which dwelt at Heshbon.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C3V3">&nbsp;</a>So the LORD our God delivered into our hands Og also, the king of Bashan, and all his people: and we
smote him until none was left to him remaining.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C3V4">&nbsp;</a>And we took all his cities at that time, there was not a city which we took not from them, threescore
cities, all the region of Argob, the kingdom of Og in Bashan.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C3V5">&nbsp;</a>All these cities
<span class="add">were</span> fenced with high walls, gates, and bars; beside unwalled towns a great many.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C3V6">&nbsp;</a>And we utterly destroyed them, as we did unto Sihon king of Heshbon, utterly destroying the men, women,
and children, of every city.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C3V7">&nbsp;</a>But all the cattle, and the spoil of the cities, we took for a prey to ourselves.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C3V8">&nbsp;</a>And we took at that time out of the hand of the two kings of the Amorites the land that
<span class="add">was</span> on this side Jordan, from the river of Arnon unto mount Hermon;
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C3V9">&nbsp;</a>(<span class="add">Which</span> Hermon the Sidonians call Sirion; and the Amorites call it Shenir;)
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C3V10">&nbsp;</a>All the cities of the plain, and all Gilead, and all Bashan, unto Salchah and Edrei, cities of the kingdom
of Og in Bashan.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C3V11">&nbsp;</a>For only Og king of Bashan remained of the remnant of giants; behold, his bedstead
<span class="add">was</span> a bedstead of iron; is it not in Rabbath of the children of Ammon? nine cubits was the length thereof,
and four cubits the breadth of it, after the cubit of a man.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C3V12">&nbsp;</a>And this land,
<span class="add">which</span> we possessed at that time, from Aroer, which
<span class="add">is</span> by the river Arnon, and half mount Gilead, and the cities thereof, gave I unto the Reubenites and to
the Gadites.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C3V13">&nbsp;</a>And the rest of Gilead, and all Bashan,
<span class="add">being</span> the kingdom of Og, gave I unto the half tribe of Manasseh; all the region of Argob, with all Bashan,
which was called the land of giants.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C3V14">&nbsp;</a>Jair the son of Manasseh took all the country of Argob unto the coasts of Geshuri and Maachathi; and
called them after his own name, Bashan- havoth-jair, unto this day.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C3V15">&nbsp;</a>And I gave Gilead unto Machir.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C3V16">&nbsp;</a>And unto the Reubenites and unto the Gadites I gave from Gilead even unto the river Arnon half the valley,
and the border even unto the river Jabbok,
<span class="add">which is</span> the border of the children of Ammon;
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C3V17">&nbsp;</a>The plain also, and Jordan, and the coast
<span class="add">thereof,</span> from Chinnereth even unto the sea of the plain,
<span class="add">even</span> the salt sea, under Ashdoth-pisgah eastward.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C3V18">&nbsp;</a>And I commanded you at that time, saying, The LORD your God hath given you this land to possess it: ye
shall pass over armed before your brethren the children of Israel, all
<span class="add">that are</span> meet for the war.
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C3V19">&nbsp;</a>But your wives, and your little ones, and your cattle, (<span class="add">for
</span> I know that ye have much cattle,) shall abide in your cities which I have given you;
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C3V20">&nbsp;</a>Until the LORD have given rest unto your brethren, as well as unto you, and
<span class="add">until</span> they also possess the land which the LORD your God hath given them beyond Jordan: and
<span class="add">then</span> shall ye return every man unto his possession, which I have given you.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C3V21">&nbsp;</a>And I commanded Joshua at that time, saying, Thine eyes have seen all that the LORD your God hath done
unto these two kings: so shall the LORD do unto all the kingdoms whither thou passest.
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C3V22">&nbsp;</a>Ye shall not fear them: for the LORD your God he shall fight for you.
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C3V23">&nbsp;</a>And I besought the LORD at that time, saying,
 <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C3V24">&nbsp;</a>O Lord GOD, thou hast begun to shew thy servant thy greatness, and thy mighty hand: for what God
<span class="add">is there</span> in heaven or in earth, that can do according to thy works, and according to thy might?
 <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C3V25">&nbsp;</a>I pray thee, let me go over, and see the good land that
<span class="add">is
</span> beyond Jordan, that goodly mountain, and Lebanon.
 <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C3V26">&nbsp;</a>But the LORD was wroth with me for your sakes, and would not hear me: and the LORD said unto me, Let
it suffice thee; speak no more unto me of this matter.
 <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C3V27">&nbsp;</a>Get thee up into the top of Pisgah, and lift up thine eyes westward, and northward, and southward, and
eastward, and behold
<span class="add">it</span> with thine eyes: for thou shalt not go over this Jordan.
 <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C3V28">&nbsp;</a>But charge Joshua, and encourage him, and strengthen him: for he shall go over before this people, and
he shall cause them to inherit the land which thou shalt see.
 <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C3V29">&nbsp;</a>So we abode in the valley over against Beth- peor.
