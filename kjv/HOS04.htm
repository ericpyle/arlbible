 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C4V1">&nbsp;</a>Hear the word of the LORD, ye children of Israel: for the LORD hath a controversy with the inhabitants
of the land, because
<span class="add">there is
</span> no truth, nor mercy, nor knowledge of God in the land.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C4V2">&nbsp;</a>By swearing, and lying, and killing, and stealing, and committing adultery, they break out, and blood
toucheth blood.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C4V3">&nbsp;</a>Therefore shall the land mourn, and every one that dwelleth therein shall languish, with the beasts of
the field, and with the fowls of heaven; yea, the fishes of the sea also shall be taken away.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C4V4">&nbsp;</a>Yet let no man strive, nor reprove another: for thy people
<span class="add">are
</span> as they that strive with the priest.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C4V5">&nbsp;</a>Therefore shalt thou fall in the day, and the prophet also shall fall with thee in the night, and I will
destroy thy mother.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C4V6">&nbsp;</a>My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge: because thou hast rejected knowledge, I will also reject
thee, that thou shalt be no priest to me: seeing thou hast forgotten the law of thy God, I will also
forget thy children.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C4V7">&nbsp;</a>As they were increased, so they sinned against me:
<span class="add">therefore
</span> will I change their glory into shame.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C4V8">&nbsp;</a>They eat up the sin of my people, and they set their heart on their iniquity.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C4V9">&nbsp;</a>And there shall be, like people, like priest: and I will punish them for their ways, and reward them
their doings.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C4V10">&nbsp;</a>For they shall eat, and not have enough: they shall commit whoredom, and shall not increase: because
they have left off to take heed to the LORD.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C4V11">&nbsp;</a>Whoredom and wine and new wine take away the heart.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C4V12">&nbsp;</a>My people ask counsel at their stocks, and their staff declareth unto them: for the spirit of whoredoms
hath caused
<span class="add">them</span> to err, and they have gone a whoring from under their God.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C4V13">&nbsp;</a>They sacrifice upon the tops of the mountains, and burn incense upon the hills, under oaks and poplars
and elms, because the shadow thereof
<span class="add">is
</span> good: therefore your daughters shall commit whoredom, and your spouses shall commit adultery.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C4V14">&nbsp;</a>I will not punish your daughters when they commit whoredom, nor your spouses when they commit adultery:
for themselves are separated with whores, and they sacrifice with harlots: therefore the people
<span class="add">that</span> doth not understand shall fall.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C4V15">&nbsp;</a>Though thou, Israel, play the harlot,
<span class="add">yet</span> let not Judah offend; and come not ye unto Gilgal, neither go ye up to Beth-aven, nor swear, The LORD
liveth.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C4V16">&nbsp;</a>For Israel slideth back as a backsliding heifer: now the LORD will feed them as a lamb in a large place.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C4V17">&nbsp;</a>Ephraim
<span class="add">is</span> joined to idols: let him alone.
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C4V18">&nbsp;</a>Their drink is sour: they have committed whoredom continually: her rulers
<span class="add">with</span> shame do love, Give ye.
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C4V19">&nbsp;</a>The wind hath bound her up in her wings, and they shall be ashamed because of their sacrifices.
