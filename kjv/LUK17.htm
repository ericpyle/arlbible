 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C17V1">&nbsp;</a>Then said he unto the disciples,
<span class="wj">It is impossible but that offences will come: but woe
unto him, through whom they come!
</span> <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C17V2">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">It were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and he cast into the sea, than that
he should offend one of these little ones.</span></div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C17V3">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Take heed to yourselves: If thy brother trespass against thee, rebuke him; and if he repent, forgive
him.
</span> <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C17V4">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And if he trespass against thee seven times in a day, and seven times in a day turn again to thee, saying,
I repent; thou shalt forgive him.
</span> <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C17V5">&nbsp;</a>And the apostles said unto the Lord, Increase our faith.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C17V6">&nbsp;</a>And the Lord said,
<span class="wj">If ye had faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye might say unto this sycamine tree, Be thou plucked up
by the root, and be thou planted in the sea; and it should obey you.
</span> <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C17V7">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">But which of you, having a servant plowing or feeding cattle, will say unto him by and by, when he is
come from the field, Go and sit down to meat?
</span> <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C17V8">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And will not rather say unto him, Make ready wherewith I may sup, and gird thyself, and serve me, till
I have eaten and drunken; and afterward thou shalt eat and drink?
</span> <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C17V9">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Doth he thank that servant because he did the things that were commanded him? I trow not.
</span> <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C17V10">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">So likewise ye, when ye shall have done all those things which are commanded you, say, We are unprofitable
servants: we have done that which was our duty to do.</span></div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C17V11">&nbsp;</a>And it came to pass, as he went to Jerusalem, that he passed through the midst of Samaria and Galilee.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C17V12">&nbsp;</a>And as he entered into a certain village, there met him ten men that were lepers, which stood afar off:
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C17V13">&nbsp;</a>And they lifted up
<span class="add">their</span> voices, and said, Jesus, Master, have mercy on us.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C17V14">&nbsp;</a>And when he saw
<span class="add">them,</span> he said unto them,
<span class="wj">Go shew yourselves unto the priests. And it came to pass, that, as they went, they were cleansed.
</span> <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C17V15">&nbsp;</a>And one of them, when he saw that he was healed, turned back, and with a loud voice glorified God,
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C17V16">&nbsp;</a>And fell down on
<span class="add">his</span> face at his feet, giving him thanks: and he was a Samaritan.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C17V17">&nbsp;</a>And Jesus answering said,
<span class="wj">Were there not ten cleansed? but where
are the nine?
</span> <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C17V18">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">There are not found that returned to give glory to God, save this stranger.
</span> <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C17V19">&nbsp;</a>And he said unto him,
<span class="wj">Arise, go thy way: thy faith hath made thee whole.</span></div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C17V20">&nbsp;</a>And when he was demanded of the Pharisees, when the kingdom of God should come, he answered them and
said,
<span class="wj">The kingdom of God cometh not with observation:
</span> <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C17V21">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Neither shall they say, Lo here! or, lo there! for, behold, the kingdom of God is within you.
</span> <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C17V22">&nbsp;</a>And he said unto the disciples,
<span class="wj">The days will come, when ye shall desire to see one of the days of the Son of man, and ye shall not see</span><span class="add">it.
</span> <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C17V23">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And they shall say to you, See here; or, see there: go not after
them, nor follow
them.
</span> <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C17V24">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">For as the lightning, that lighteneth out of the one
part under heaven, shineth unto the other
part under heaven; so shall also the Son of man be in his day.
</span> <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C17V25">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">But first must he suffer many things, and be rejected of this generation.
</span> <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C17V26">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And as it was in the days of Noe, so shall it be also in the days of the Son of man.
</span> <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C17V27">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">They did eat, they drank, they married wives, they were given in marriage, until the day that Noe entered
into the ark, and the flood came, and destroyed them all.
</span> <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C17V28">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Likewise also as it was in the days of Lot; they did eat, they drank, they bought, they sold, they planted,
they builded;
</span> <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C17V29">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">But the same day that Lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven, and destroyed
them all.
</span> <span class="verse"> 30</span><a name="C17V30">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Even thus shall it be in the day when the Son of man is revealed.
</span> <span class="verse"> 31</span><a name="C17V31">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">In that day, he which shall be upon the housetop, and his stuff in the house, let him not come down to
take it away: and he that is in the field, let him likewise not return back.
</span> <span class="verse"> 32</span><a name="C17V32">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Remember Lot’s wife.
</span> <span class="verse"> 33</span><a name="C17V33">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Whosoever shall seek to save his life shall lose it; and whosoever shall lose his life shall preserve
it.
</span> <span class="verse"> 34</span><a name="C17V34">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">I tell you, in that night there shall be two
men in one bed; the one shall be taken, and the other shall be left.
</span> <span class="verse"> 35</span><a name="C17V35">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Two
women shall be grinding together; the one shall be taken, and the other left.
</span> <span class="verse"> 36</span><a name="C17V36">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Two
men shall be in the field; the one shall be taken, and the other left.
</span> <span class="verse"> 37</span><a name="C17V37">&nbsp;</a>And they answered and said unto him, Where, Lord? And he said unto them,
<span class="wj">Wheresoever the body is, thither will the eagles be gathered together.
