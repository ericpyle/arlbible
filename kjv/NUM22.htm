 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C22V1">&nbsp;</a>And the children of Israel set forward, and pitched in the plains of Moab on this side Jordan
<span class="add">by</span> Jericho.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C22V2">&nbsp;</a>And Balak the son of Zippor saw all that Israel had done to the Amorites.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C22V3">&nbsp;</a>And Moab was sore afraid of the people, because they
<span class="add">were</span> many: and Moab was distressed because of the children of Israel.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C22V4">&nbsp;</a>And Moab said unto the elders of Midian, Now shall this company lick up all
<span class="add">that are</span> round about us, as the ox licketh up the grass of the field. And Balak the son of Zippor
<span class="add">was</span> king of the Moabites at that time.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C22V5">&nbsp;</a>He sent messengers therefore unto Balaam the son of Beor to Pethor, which
<span class="add">is</span> by the river of the land of the children of his people, to call him, saying, Behold, there is a people
come out from Egypt: behold, they cover the face of the earth, and they abide over against me:
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C22V6">&nbsp;</a>Come now therefore, I pray thee, curse me this people; for they
<span class="add">are</span> too mighty for me: peradventure I shall prevail,
<span class="add">that</span> we may smite them, and
<span class="add">that</span> I may drive them out of the land: for I wot that he whom thou blessest
<span class="add">is</span> blessed, and he whom thou cursest is cursed.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C22V7">&nbsp;</a>And the elders of Moab and the elders of Midian departed with the rewards of divination in their hand;
and they came unto Balaam, and spake unto him the words of Balak.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C22V8">&nbsp;</a>And he said unto them, Lodge here this night, and I will bring you word again, as the LORD shall speak
unto me: and the princes of Moab abode with Balaam.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C22V9">&nbsp;</a>And God came unto Balaam, and said, What men
<span class="add">are</span> these with thee?
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C22V10">&nbsp;</a>And Balaam said unto God, Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, hath sent unto me,
<span class="add">saying,
</span> <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C22V11">&nbsp;</a>Behold,
<span class="add">there is</span> a people come out of Egypt, which covereth the face of the earth: come now, curse me them; peradventure
I shall be able to overcome them, and drive them out.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C22V12">&nbsp;</a>And God said unto Balaam, Thou shalt not go with them; thou shalt not curse the people: for they
<span class="add">are</span> blessed.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C22V13">&nbsp;</a>And Balaam rose up in the morning, and said unto the princes of Balak, Get you into your land: for the
LORD refuseth to give me leave to go with you.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C22V14">&nbsp;</a>And the princes of Moab rose up, and they went unto Balak, and said, Balaam refuseth to come with us.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C22V15">&nbsp;</a>And Balak sent yet again princes, more, and more honourable than they.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C22V16">&nbsp;</a>And they came to Balaam, and said to him, Thus saith Balak the son of Zippor, Let nothing, I pray thee,
hinder thee from coming unto me:
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C22V17">&nbsp;</a>For I will promote thee unto very great honour, and I will do whatsoever thou sayest unto me: come therefore,
I pray thee, curse me this people.
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C22V18">&nbsp;</a>And Balaam answered and said unto the servants of Balak, If Balak would give me his house full of silver
and gold, I cannot go beyond the word of the LORD my God, to do less or more.
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C22V19">&nbsp;</a>Now therefore, I pray you, tarry ye also here this night, that I may know what the LORD will say unto
me more.
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C22V20">&nbsp;</a>And God came unto Balaam at night, and said unto him, If the men come to call thee, rise up,
<span class="add">and</span> go with them; but yet the word which I shall say unto thee, that shalt thou do.
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C22V21">&nbsp;</a>And Balaam rose up in the morning, and saddled his ass, and went with the princes of Moab.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C22V22">&nbsp;</a>And God’s anger was kindled because he went: and the angel of the LORD stood in the way for an adversary
against him. Now he was riding upon his ass, and his two servants
<span class="add">were</span> with him.
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C22V23">&nbsp;</a>And the ass saw the angel of the LORD standing in the way, and his sword drawn in his hand: and the ass
turned aside out of the way, and went into the field: and Balaam smote the ass, to turn her into the
way.
 <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C22V24">&nbsp;</a>But the angel of the LORD stood in a path of the vineyards, a wall
<span class="add">being</span> on this side, and a wall on that side.
 <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C22V25">&nbsp;</a>And when the ass saw the angel of the LORD, she thrust herself unto the wall, and crushed Balaam’s foot
against the wall: and he smote her again.
 <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C22V26">&nbsp;</a>And the angel of the LORD went further, and stood in a narrow place, where
<span class="add">was</span> no way to turn either to the right hand or to the left.
 <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C22V27">&nbsp;</a>And when the ass saw the angel of the LORD, she fell down under Balaam: and Balaam’s anger was kindled,
and he smote the ass with a staff.
 <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C22V28">&nbsp;</a>And the LORD opened the mouth of the ass, and she said unto Balaam, What have I done unto thee, that
thou hast smitten me these three times?
 <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C22V29">&nbsp;</a>And Balaam said unto the ass, Because thou hast mocked me: I would there were a sword in mine hand, for
now would I kill thee.
 <span class="verse"> 30</span><a name="C22V30">&nbsp;</a>And the ass said unto Balaam,
<span class="add">Am</span> not I thine ass, upon which thou hast ridden ever since
<span class="add">I was</span> thine unto this day? was I ever wont to do so unto thee? And he said, Nay.
 <span class="verse"> 31</span><a name="C22V31">&nbsp;</a>Then the LORD opened the eyes of Balaam, and he saw the angel of the LORD standing in the way, and his
sword drawn in his hand: and he bowed down his head, and fell flat on his face.
 <span class="verse"> 32</span><a name="C22V32">&nbsp;</a>And the angel of the LORD said unto him, Wherefore hast thou smitten thine ass these three times? behold,
I went out to withstand thee, because
<span class="add">thy</span> way is perverse before me:
 <span class="verse"> 33</span><a name="C22V33">&nbsp;</a>And the ass saw me, and turned from me these three times: unless she had turned from me, surely now also
I had slain thee, and saved her alive.
 <span class="verse"> 34</span><a name="C22V34">&nbsp;</a>And Balaam said unto the angel of the LORD, I have sinned; for I knew not that thou stoodest in the way
against me: now therefore, if it displease thee, I will get me back again.
 <span class="verse"> 35</span><a name="C22V35">&nbsp;</a>And the angel of the LORD said unto Balaam, Go with the men: but only the word that I shall speak unto
thee, that thou shalt speak. So Balaam went with the princes of Balak.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 36</span><a name="C22V36">&nbsp;</a>And when Balak heard that Balaam was come, he went out to meet him unto a city of Moab, which
<span class="add">is</span> in the border of Arnon, which
<span class="add">is</span> in the utmost coast.
 <span class="verse"> 37</span><a name="C22V37">&nbsp;</a>And Balak said unto Balaam, Did I not earnestly send unto thee to call thee? wherefore camest thou not
unto me? am I not able indeed to promote thee to honour?
 <span class="verse"> 38</span><a name="C22V38">&nbsp;</a>And Balaam said unto Balak, Lo, I am come unto thee: have I now any power at all to say any thing? the
word that God putteth in my mouth, that shall I speak.
 <span class="verse"> 39</span><a name="C22V39">&nbsp;</a>And Balaam went with Balak, and they came unto Kirjath-huzoth.
 <span class="verse"> 40</span><a name="C22V40">&nbsp;</a>And Balak offered oxen and sheep, and sent to Balaam, and to the princes that
<span class="add">were</span> with him.
 <span class="verse"> 41</span><a name="C22V41">&nbsp;</a>And it came to pass on the morrow, that Balak took Balaam, and brought him up into the high places of
Baal, that thence he might see the utmost
<span class="add">part</span> of the people.
