 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C22V1">&nbsp;</a>And he shewed me a pure river of water of life, clear as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God
and of the Lamb.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C22V2">&nbsp;</a>In the midst of the street of it, and on either side of the river,
<span class="add">was there</span> the tree of life, which bare twelve
<span class="add">manner
</span> of fruits,
<span class="add">and</span> yielded her fruit every month: and the leaves of the tree
<span class="add">were</span> for the healing of the nations.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C22V3">&nbsp;</a>And there shall be no more curse: but the throne of God and of the Lamb shall be in it; and his servants
shall serve him:
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C22V4">&nbsp;</a>And they shall see his face; and his name
<span class="add">shall be</span> in their foreheads.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C22V5">&nbsp;</a>And there shall be no night there; and they need no candle, neither light of the sun; for the Lord God
giveth them light: and they shall reign for ever and ever.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C22V6">&nbsp;</a>And he said unto me, These sayings
<span class="add">are</span> faithful and true: and the Lord God of the holy prophets sent his angel to shew unto his servants the
things which must shortly be done.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C22V7">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Behold, I come quickly: blessed is he that keepeth the sayings of the prophecy of this book.
</span> <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C22V8">&nbsp;</a>And I John saw these things, and heard
<span class="add">them.</span> And when I had heard and seen, I fell down to worship before the feet of the angel which shewed me these
things.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C22V9">&nbsp;</a>Then saith he unto me, See
<span class="add">thou do it</span> not: for I am thy fellowservant, and of thy brethren the prophets, and of them which keep the sayings
of this book: worship God.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C22V10">&nbsp;</a>And he saith unto me, Seal not the sayings of the prophecy of this book: for the time is at hand.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C22V11">&nbsp;</a>He that is unjust, let him be unjust still: and he which is filthy, let him be filthy still: and he that
is righteous, let him be righteous still: and he that is holy, let him be holy still.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C22V12">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And, behold, I come quickly; and my reward
</span><span class="add">is</span><span class="wj"> with me, to give every man according as his work shall be.
</span> <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C22V13">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end, the first and the last.
</span> <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C22V14">&nbsp;</a>Blessed
<span class="add">are</span> they that do his commandments, that they may have right to the tree of life, and may enter in through
the gates into the city.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C22V15">&nbsp;</a>For without
<span class="add">are</span> dogs, and sorcerers, and whoremongers, and murderers, and idolaters, and whosoever loveth and maketh
a lie.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C22V16">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">I Jesus have sent mine angel to testify unto you these things in the churches. I am the root and the
offspring of David,
</span><span class="add">and</span><span class="wj"> the bright and morning star.</span></div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C22V17">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And the Spirit and the bride say, Come. And let him that heareth say, Come. And let him that is athirst
come. And whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely.</span></div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C22V18">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">For I testify unto every man that heareth the words of the prophecy of this book, If any man shall add
unto these things, God shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book:
</span> <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C22V19">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part
out of the book of life, and out of the holy city, and
</span><span class="add">from</span><span class="wj"> the things which are written in this book.</span></div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C22V20">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">He which testifieth these things saith, Surely I come quickly.
</span> Amen. Even so, come, Lord Jesus.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C22V21">&nbsp;</a>The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ
<span class="add">be</span> with you all. Amen.
