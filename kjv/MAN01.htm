 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C1V1">&nbsp;</a>O Lord, Almighty God of our fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and of their righteous seed;
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C1V2">&nbsp;</a>who hast made heaven and earth, with all the ornament thereof;
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C1V3">&nbsp;</a>who hast bound the sea by the word of thy commandment; who hast shut up the deep, and sealed it by thy
terrible and glorious name;
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C1V4">&nbsp;</a>whom all men fear, and tremble before thy power; for the majesty of thy glory cannot be borne, and thine
angry threatening toward sinners is importable:
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C1V5">&nbsp;</a>but thy merciful promise is unmeasurable and unsearchable;
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C1V6">&nbsp;</a>for thou art the most high Lord, of great compassion, longsuffering, very merciful, and repentest of
the evils of men. Thou, O Lord, according to thy great goodness hast promised repentance and forgiveness
to them that have sinned against thee: and of thine infinite mercies hast appointed repentance unto sinners,
that they may be saved.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C1V7">&nbsp;</a>Thou therefore, O Lord, that art the God of the just, hast not appointed repentance to the just, as to
Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, which have not sinned against thee; but thou hast appointed repentance
unto me that am a sinner:
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C1V8">&nbsp;</a>for I have sinned above the number of the sands of the sea. My transgressions, O Lord, are multiplied:
my transgressions are multiplied, and I am not worthy to behold and see the height of heaven for the
multitude of mine iniquities.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C1V9">&nbsp;</a>I am bowed down with many iron bands, that I cannot lift up mine head, neither have any release: for
I have provoked thy wrath, and done evil before thee: I did not thy will, neither kept I thy commandments:
I have set up abominations, and have multiplied offences.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C1V10">&nbsp;</a>Now therefore I bow the knee of mine heart, beseeching thee of grace.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C1V11">&nbsp;</a>I have sinned, O Lord, I have sinned, and I acknowledge mine iniquities:
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C1V12">&nbsp;</a>wherefore, I humbly beseech thee, forgive me, O Lord, forgive me, and destroy me not with mine iniquites.
Be not angry with me for ever, by reserving evil for me; neither condemn me to the lower parts of the
earth. For thou art the God, even the God of them that repent;
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C1V13">&nbsp;</a>and in me thou wilt shew all thy goodness: for thou wilt save me, that am unworthy, according to thy
great mercy.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C1V14">&nbsp;</a>Therefore I will praise thee for ever all the days of my life: for all the powers of the heavens do praise
thee, and thine is the glory for ever and ever. Amen.
