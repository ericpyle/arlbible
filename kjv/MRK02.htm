 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C2V1">&nbsp;</a>And again he entered into Capernaum, after
<span class="add">some</span> days; and it was noised that he was in the house.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C2V2">&nbsp;</a>And straightway many were gathered together, insomuch that there was no room to receive
<span class="add">them,</span> no, not so much as about the door: and he preached the word unto them.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C2V3">&nbsp;</a>And they come unto him, bringing one sick of the palsy, which was borne of four.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C2V4">&nbsp;</a>And when they could not come nigh unto him for the press, they uncovered the roof where he was: and when
they had broken
<span class="add">it</span> up, they let down the bed wherein the sick of the palsy lay.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C2V5">&nbsp;</a>When Jesus saw their faith, he said unto the sick of the palsy,
<span class="wj">Son, thy sins be forgiven thee.
</span> <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C2V6">&nbsp;</a>But there were certain of the scribes sitting there, and reasoning in their hearts,
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C2V7">&nbsp;</a>Why doth this
<span class="add">man</span> thus speak blasphemies? who can forgive sins but God only?
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C2V8">&nbsp;</a>And immediately when Jesus perceived in his spirit that they so reasoned within themselves, he said unto
them,
<span class="wj">Why reason ye these things in your hearts?
</span> <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C2V9">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Whether is it easier to say to the sick of the palsy,
</span><span class="add">Thy
</span><span class="wj"> sins be forgiven thee; or to say, Arise, and take up thy bed, and walk?
</span> <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C2V10">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">But that ye may know that the Son of man hath power on earth to forgive sins,</span> (he saith to the sick of the palsy,)
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C2V11">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">I say unto thee, Arise, and take up thy bed, and go thy way into thine house.
</span> <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C2V12">&nbsp;</a>And immediately he arose, took up the bed, and went forth before them all; insomuch that they were all
amazed, and glorified God, saying, We never saw it on this fashion.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C2V13">&nbsp;</a>And he went forth again by the sea side; and all the multitude resorted unto him, and he taught them.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C2V14">&nbsp;</a>And as he passed by, he saw Levi the
<span class="add">son</span> of Alphaeus sitting at the receipt of custom, and said unto him,
<span class="wj">Follow me.</span> And he arose and followed him.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C2V15">&nbsp;</a>And it came to pass, that, as Jesus sat at meat in his house, many publicans and sinners sat also together
with Jesus and his disciples: for there were many, and they followed him.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C2V16">&nbsp;</a>And when the scribes and Pharisees saw him eat with publicans and sinners, they said unto his disciples,
How is it that he eateth and drinketh with publicans and sinners?
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C2V17">&nbsp;</a>When Jesus heard
<span class="add">it,</span> he saith unto them,
<span class="wj">They that are whole have no need of the physician, but they that are sick: I came not to call the righteous,
but sinners to repentance.
</span> <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C2V18">&nbsp;</a>And the disciples of John and of the Pharisees used to fast: and they come and say unto him, Why do the
disciples of John and of the Pharisees fast, but thy disciples fast not?
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C2V19">&nbsp;</a>And Jesus said unto them,
<span class="wj">Can the children of the bridechamber fast, while the bridegroom is with them? as long as they have the
bridegroom with them, they cannot fast.
</span> <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C2V20">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">But the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them, and then shall they fast in
those days.
</span> <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C2V21">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">No man also seweth a piece of new cloth on an old garment: else the new piece that filled it up taketh
away from the old, and the rent is made worse.
</span> <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C2V22">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And no man putteth new wine into old bottles: else the new wine doth burst the bottles, and the wine
is spilled, and the bottles will be marred: but new wine must be put into new bottles.
</span> <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C2V23">&nbsp;</a>And it came to pass, that he went through the corn fields on the sabbath day; and his disciples began,
as they went, to pluck the ears of corn.
 <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C2V24">&nbsp;</a>And the Pharisees said unto him, Behold, why do they on the sabbath day that which is not lawful?
 <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C2V25">&nbsp;</a>And he said unto them,
<span class="wj">Have ye never read what David did, when he had need, and was an hungred, he, and they that were with
him?
</span> <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C2V26">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">How he went into the house of God in the days of Abiathar the high priest, and did eat the shewbread,
which is not lawful to eat but for the priests, and gave also to them which were with him?
</span> <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C2V27">&nbsp;</a>And he said unto them,
<span class="wj">The sabbath was made for man, and not man for the sabbath:
</span> <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C2V28">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Therefore the Son of man is Lord also of the sabbath.</span></div>
