 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C14V1">&nbsp;</a>And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C14V2">&nbsp;</a>This shall be the law of the leper in the day of his cleansing: He shall be brought unto the priest:
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C14V3">&nbsp;</a>And the priest shall go forth out of the camp; and the priest shall look, and, behold,
<span class="add">if</span> the plague of leprosy be healed in the leper;
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C14V4">&nbsp;</a>Then shall the priest command to take for him that is to be cleansed two birds alive
<span class="add">and</span> clean, and cedar wood, and scarlet, and hyssop:
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C14V5">&nbsp;</a>And the priest shall command that one of the birds be killed in an earthen vessel over running water:
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C14V6">&nbsp;</a>As for the living bird, he shall take it, and the cedar wood, and the scarlet, and the hyssop, and shall
dip them and the living bird in the blood of the bird
<span class="add">that was</span> killed over the running water:
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C14V7">&nbsp;</a>And he shall sprinkle upon him that is to be cleansed from the leprosy seven times, and shall pronounce
him clean, and shall let the living bird loose into the open field.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C14V8">&nbsp;</a>And he that is to be cleansed shall wash his clothes, and shave off all his hair, and wash himself in
water, that he may be clean: and after that he shall come into the camp, and shall tarry abroad out of
his tent seven days.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C14V9">&nbsp;</a>But it shall be on the seventh day, that he shall shave all his hair off his head and his beard and his
eyebrows, even all his hair he shall shave off: and he shall wash his clothes, also he shall wash his
flesh in water, and he shall be clean.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C14V10">&nbsp;</a>And on the eighth day he shall take two he lambs without blemish, and one ewe lamb of the first year
without blemish, and three tenth deals of fine flour
<span class="add">for</span> a meat offering, mingled with oil, and one log of oil.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C14V11">&nbsp;</a>And the priest that maketh
<span class="add">him</span> clean shall present the man that is to be made clean, and those things, before the LORD,

the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot, upon the blood of the trespass
offering:
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C14V18">&nbsp;</a>And the remnant of the oil that
<span class="add">is</span> in the priest’s hand he shall pour upon the head of him that is to be cleansed: and the priest shall
make an atonement for him before the LORD.
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C14V19">&nbsp;</a>And the priest shall offer the sin offering, and make an atonement for him that is to be cleansed from
his uncleanness; and afterward he shall kill the burnt offering:

make an atonement for him, and he shall be clean.
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C14V21">&nbsp;</a>And if he
<span class="add">be</span> poor, and cannot get so much; then he shall take one lamb

with oil for a meat offering, and a log of oil;

of the congregation, before the LORD.

upon the great toe of his right foot:

<span class="add">some</span> of the oil that

hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot, upon the place of the blood of the trespass offering:

for him before the LORD.
 <span class="verse"> 30</span><a name="C14V30">&nbsp;</a>And he shall offer the one of the turtledoves, or of the young pigeons, such as he can get;

<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 33</span><a name="C14V33">&nbsp;</a>And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,
 <span class="verse"> 34</span><a name="C14V34">&nbsp;</a>When ye be come into the land of Canaan, which I give to you for a possession, and I put the plague of
leprosy in a house of the land of your possession;
 <span class="verse"> 35</span><a name="C14V35">&nbsp;</a>And he that owneth the house shall come and tell the priest, saying, It seemeth to me
<span class="add">there is</span> as it were a plague in the house:
 <span class="verse"> 36</span><a name="C14V36">&nbsp;</a>Then the priest shall command that they empty the house, before the priest go
<span class="add">into it</span> to see the plague, that all that
<span class="add">is</span> in the house be not made unclean: and afterward the priest shall go in to see the house:
 <span class="verse"> 37</span><a name="C14V37">&nbsp;</a>And he shall look on the plague, and, behold,
<span class="add">if</span> the plague
<span class="add">be</span> in the walls of the house with hollow strakes, greenish or reddish, which in sight
<span class="add">are</span> lower than the wall;
 <span class="verse"> 38</span><a name="C14V38">&nbsp;</a>Then the priest shall go out of the house to the door of the house, and shut up the house seven days:
 <span class="verse"> 39</span><a name="C14V39">&nbsp;</a>And the priest shall come again the seventh day, and shall look: and, behold,
<span class="add">if</span> the plague be spread in the walls of the house;
 <span class="verse"> 40</span><a name="C14V40">&nbsp;</a>Then the priest shall command that they take away the stones in which the plague
<span class="add">is,</span> and they shall cast them into an unclean place without the city:
 <span class="verse"> 41</span><a name="C14V41">&nbsp;</a>And he shall cause the house to be scraped within round about, and they shall pour out the dust that
they scrape off without the city into an unclean place:
 <span class="verse"> 42</span><a name="C14V42">&nbsp;</a>And they shall take other stones, and put
<span class="add">them</span> in the place of those stones; and he shall take other morter, and shall plaister the house.
 <span class="verse"> 43</span><a name="C14V43">&nbsp;</a>And if the plague come again, and break out in the house, after that he hath taken away the stones, and
after he hath scraped the house, and after it is plaistered;
 <span class="verse"> 44</span><a name="C14V44">&nbsp;</a>Then the priest shall come and look, and, behold,
<span class="add">if</span> the plague be spread in the house, it
<span class="add">is</span> a fretting leprosy in the house: it is unclean.
 <span class="verse"> 45</span><a name="C14V45">&nbsp;</a>And he shall break down the house, the stones of it, and the timber thereof, and all the morter of the
house; and he shall carry
<span class="add">them</span> forth out of the city into an unclean place.
 <span class="verse"> 46</span><a name="C14V46">&nbsp;</a>Moreover he that goeth into the house all the while that it is shut up shall be unclean until the even.
 <span class="verse"> 47</span><a name="C14V47">&nbsp;</a>And he that lieth in the house shall wash his clothes; and he that eateth in the house shall wash his
clothes.
 <span class="verse"> 48</span><a name="C14V48">&nbsp;</a>And if the priest shall come in, and look
<span class="add">upon it,</span> and, behold, the plague hath not spread in the house, after the house was plaistered: then the priest
shall pronounce the house clean, because the plague is healed.
 <span class="verse"> 49</span><a name="C14V49">&nbsp;</a>And he shall take to cleanse the house two birds, and cedar wood, and scarlet, and hyssop:
 <span class="verse"> 50</span><a name="C14V50">&nbsp;</a>And he shall kill the one of the birds in an earthen vessel over running water:
 <span class="verse"> 51</span><a name="C14V51">&nbsp;</a>And he shall take the cedar wood, and the hyssop, and the scarlet, and the living bird, and dip them
in the blood of the slain bird, and in the running water, and sprinkle the house seven times:
 <span class="verse"> 52</span><a name="C14V52">&nbsp;</a>And he shall cleanse the house with the blood of the bird, and with the running water, and with the living
bird, and with the cedar wood, and with the hyssop, and with the scarlet:
 <span class="verse"> 53</span><a name="C14V53">&nbsp;</a>But he shall let go the living bird out of the city into the open fields, and make an atonement for the
house: and it shall be clean.
 <span class="verse"> 54</span><a name="C14V54">&nbsp;</a>This
<span class="add">is</span> the law for all manner of plague of leprosy, and scall,
 <span class="verse"> 55</span><a name="C14V55">&nbsp;</a>And for the leprosy of a garment, and of a house,
 <span class="verse"> 56</span><a name="C14V56">&nbsp;</a>And for a rising, and for a scab, and for a bright spot:
 <span class="verse"> 57</span><a name="C14V57">&nbsp;</a>To teach when
<span class="add">it is</span> unclean, and when
<span class="add">it is</span> clean: this
