 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C4V1">&nbsp;</a>Now the Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith, giving
heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils;
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C4V2">&nbsp;</a>Speaking lies in hypocrisy; having their conscience seared with a hot iron;
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C4V3">&nbsp;</a>Forbidding to marry,
<span class="add">and commanding</span> to abstain from meats, which God hath created to be received with thanksgiving of them which believe
and know the truth.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C4V4">&nbsp;</a>For every creature of God
<span class="add">is</span> good, and nothing to be refused, if it be received with thanksgiving:
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C4V5">&nbsp;</a>For it is sanctified by the word of God and prayer.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C4V6">&nbsp;</a>If thou put the brethren in remembrance of these things, thou shalt be a good minister of Jesus Christ,
nourished up in the words of faith and of good doctrine, whereunto thou hast attained.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C4V7">&nbsp;</a>But refuse profane and old wives’ fables, and exercise thyself
<span class="add">rather</span> unto godliness.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C4V8">&nbsp;</a>For bodily exercise profiteth little: but godliness is profitable unto all things, having promise of
the life that now is, and of that which is to come.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C4V9">&nbsp;</a>This
<span class="add">is</span> a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptation.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C4V10">&nbsp;</a>For therefore we both labour and suffer reproach, because we trust in the living God, who is the Saviour
of all men, specially of those that believe.

<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C4V11">&nbsp;</a>These things command and teach.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C4V12">&nbsp;</a>Let no man despise thy youth; but be thou an example of the believers, in word, in conversation, in charity,
in spirit, in faith, in purity.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C4V13">&nbsp;</a>Till I come, give attendance to reading, to exhortation, to doctrine.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C4V14">&nbsp;</a>Neglect not the gift that is in thee, which was given thee by prophecy, with the laying on of the hands
of the presbytery.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C4V15">&nbsp;</a>Meditate upon these things; give thyself wholly to them; that thy profiting may appear to all.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C4V16">&nbsp;</a>Take heed unto thyself, and unto the doctrine; continue in them: for in doing this thou shalt both save
thyself, and them that hear thee.
