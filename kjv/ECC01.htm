<div class="mt1">Ecclesiastes or, the Preacher
</div>
<div class="chapterlabel"> 1</div><div class="p">
 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C1V1">&nbsp;</a>The words of the Preacher, the son of David, king in Jerusalem.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C1V2">&nbsp;</a>Vanity of vanities, saith the Preacher, vanity of vanities; all
<span class="add">is</span> vanity.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C1V3">&nbsp;</a>What profit hath a man of all his labour which he taketh under the sun?
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C1V4">&nbsp;</a><span class="add">One</span> generation passeth away, and
<span class="add">another</span> generation cometh: but the earth abideth for ever.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C1V5">&nbsp;</a>The sun also ariseth, and the sun goeth down, and hasteth to his place where he arose.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C1V6">&nbsp;</a>The wind goeth toward the south, and turneth about unto the north; it whirleth about continually, and
the wind returneth again according to his circuits.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C1V7">&nbsp;</a>All the rivers run into the sea; yet the sea
<span class="add">is</span> not full; unto the place from whence the rivers come, thither they return again.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C1V8">&nbsp;</a>All things
<span class="add">are</span> full of labour; man cannot utter
<span class="add">it:
</span> the eye is not satisfied with seeing, nor the ear filled with hearing.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C1V9">&nbsp;</a>The thing that hath been, it
<span class="add">is that</span> which shall be; and that which is done
<span class="add">is</span> that which shall be done: and
<span class="add">there is
</span> no new
<span class="add">thing</span> under the sun.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C1V10">&nbsp;</a>Is there
<span class="add">any</span> thing whereof it may be said, See, this
<span class="add">is</span> new? it hath been already of old time, which was before us.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C1V11">&nbsp;</a><span class="add">There is</span> no remembrance of former
<span class="add">things;</span> neither shall there be
<span class="add">any</span> remembrance of
<span class="add">things</span> that are to come with
<span class="add">those</span> that shall come after.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C1V12">&nbsp;</a>I the Preacher was king over Israel in Jerusalem.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C1V13">&nbsp;</a>And I gave my heart to seek and search out by wisdom concerning all
<span class="add">things</span> that are done under heaven: this sore travail hath God given to the sons of man to be exercised therewith.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C1V14">&nbsp;</a>I have seen all the works that are done under the sun; and, behold, all
<span class="add">is</span> vanity and vexation of spirit.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C1V15">&nbsp;</a><span class="add">That which is</span> crooked cannot be made straight: and that which is wanting cannot be numbered.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C1V16">&nbsp;</a>I communed with mine own heart, saying, Lo, I am come to great estate, and have gotten more wisdom than
all
<span class="add">they</span> that have been before me in Jerusalem: yea, my heart had great experience of wisdom and knowledge.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C1V17">&nbsp;</a>And I gave my heart to know wisdom, and to know madness and folly: I perceived that this also is vexation
of spirit.
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C1V18">&nbsp;</a>For in much wisdom
<span class="add">is</span> much grief: and he that increaseth knowledge increaseth sorrow.
