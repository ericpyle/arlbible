 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C16V1">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And he said also unto his disciples, There was a certain rich man, which had a steward; and the same
was accused unto him that he had wasted his goods.
</span> <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C16V2">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And he called him, and said unto him, How is it that I hear this of thee? give an account of thy stewardship;
for thou mayest be no longer steward.
</span> <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C16V3">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Then the steward said within himself, What shall I do? for my lord taketh away from me the stewardship:
I cannot dig; to beg I am ashamed.
</span> <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C16V4">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">I am resolved what to do, that, when I am put out of the stewardship, they may receive me into their
houses.
</span> <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C16V5">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">So he called every one of his lord’s debtors
</span><span class="add">unto him,
</span><span class="wj"> and said unto the first, How much owest thou unto my lord?
</span> <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C16V6">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And he said, An hundred measures of oil. And he said unto him, Take thy bill, and sit down quickly, and
write fifty.
</span> <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C16V7">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Then said he to another, And how much owest thou? And he said, An hundred measures of wheat. And he said
unto him, Take thy bill, and write fourscore.
</span> <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C16V8">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And the lord commended the unjust steward, because he had done wisely: for the children of this world
are in their generation wiser than the children of light.
</span> <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C16V9">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And I say unto you, Make to yourselves friends of the mammon of unrighteousness; that, when ye fail,
they may receive you into everlasting habitations.
</span> <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C16V10">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">He that is faithful in that which is least is faithful also in much: and he that is unjust in the least
is unjust also in much.
</span> <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C16V11">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">If therefore ye have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon, who will commit to your trust the true
</span><span class="add">riches?
</span> <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C16V12">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And if ye have not been faithful in that which is another man’s, who shall give you that which is your
own?</span></div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C16V13">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">No servant can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will
hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon.
</span> <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C16V14">&nbsp;</a>And the Pharisees also, who were covetous, heard all these things: and they derided him.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C16V15">&nbsp;</a>And he said unto them,
<span class="wj">Ye are they which justify yourselves before men; but God knoweth your hearts: for that which is highly
esteemed among men is abomination in the sight of God.
</span> <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C16V16">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">The law and the prophets
</span><span class="add">were</span><span class="wj"> until John: since that time the kingdom of God is preached, and every man presseth into it.
</span> <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C16V17">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And it is easier for heaven and earth to pass, than one tittle of the law to fail.
</span> <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C16V18">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Whosoever putteth away his wife, and marrieth another, committeth adultery: and whosoever marrieth her
that is put away from
</span><span class="add">her
</span><span class="wj"> husband committeth adultery.</span></div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C16V19">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">There was a certain rich man, which was clothed in purple and fine linen, and fared sumptuously every
day:
</span> <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C16V20">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And there was a certain beggar named Lazarus, which was laid at his gate, full of sores,
</span> <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C16V21">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And desiring to be fed with the crumbs which fell from the rich man’s table: moreover the dogs came and
licked his sores.
</span> <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C16V22">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And it came to pass, that the beggar died, and was carried by the angels into Abraham’s bosom: the rich
man also died, and was buried;
</span> <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C16V23">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And in hell he lift up his eyes, being in torments, and seeth Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom.
</span> <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C16V24">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And he cried and said, Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of
his finger in water, and cool my tongue; for I am tormented in this flame.
</span> <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C16V25">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">But Abraham said, Son, remember that thou in thy lifetime receivedst thy good things, and likewise Lazarus
evil things: but now he is comforted, and thou art tormented.
</span> <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C16V26">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And beside all this, between us and you there is a great gulf fixed: so that they which would pass from
hence to you cannot; neither can they pass to us, that
</span><span class="add">would come</span><span class="wj"> from thence.
</span> <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C16V27">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Then he said, I pray thee therefore, father, that thou wouldest send him to my father’s house:
</span> <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C16V28">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">For I have five brethren; that he may testify unto them, lest they also come into this place of torment.
</span> <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C16V29">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Abraham saith unto him, They have Moses and the prophets; let them hear them.
</span> <span class="verse"> 30</span><a name="C16V30">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And he said, Nay, father Abraham: but if one went unto them from the dead, they will repent.
</span> <span class="verse"> 31</span><a name="C16V31">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And he said unto him, If they hear not Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded, though
one rose from the dead.</span></div>
