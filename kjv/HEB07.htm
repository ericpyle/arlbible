 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C7V1">&nbsp;</a>For this Melchisedec, king of Salem, priest of the most high God, who met Abraham returning from the
slaughter of the kings, and blessed him;
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C7V2">&nbsp;</a>To whom also Abraham gave a tenth part of all; first being by interpretation King of righteousness, and
after that also King of Salem, which is, King of peace;
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C7V3">&nbsp;</a>Without father, without mother, without descent, having neither beginning of days, nor end of life; but
made like unto the Son of God; abideth a priest continually.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C7V4">&nbsp;</a>Now consider how great this man
<span class="add">was,</span> unto whom even the patriarch Abraham gave the tenth of the spoils.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C7V5">&nbsp;</a>And verily they that are of the sons of Levi, who receive the office of the priesthood, have a commandment
to take tithes of the people according to the law, that is, of their brethren, though they come out of
the loins of Abraham:
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C7V6">&nbsp;</a>But he whose descent is not counted from them received tithes of Abraham, and blessed him that had the
promises.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C7V7">&nbsp;</a>And without all contradiction the less is blessed of the better.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C7V8">&nbsp;</a>And here men that die receive tithes; but there he
<span class="add">receiveth them,</span> of whom it is witnessed that he liveth.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C7V9">&nbsp;</a>And as I may so say, Levi also, who receiveth tithes, payed tithes in Abraham.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C7V10">&nbsp;</a>For he was yet in the loins of his father, when Melchisedec met him.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C7V11">&nbsp;</a>If therefore perfection were by the Levitical priesthood, (for under it the people received the law,)
what further need
<span class="add">was there</span> that another priest should rise after the order of Melchisedec, and not be called after the order of
Aaron?
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C7V12">&nbsp;</a>For the priesthood being changed, there is made of necessity a change also of the law.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C7V13">&nbsp;</a>For he of whom these things are spoken pertaineth to another tribe, of which no man gave attendance at
the altar.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C7V14">&nbsp;</a>For
<span class="add">it is</span> evident that our Lord sprang out of Juda; of which tribe Moses spake nothing concerning priesthood.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C7V15">&nbsp;</a>And it is yet far more evident: for that after the similitude of Melchisedec there ariseth another priest,
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C7V16">&nbsp;</a>Who is made, not after the law of a carnal commandment, but after the power of an endless life.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C7V17">&nbsp;</a>For he testifieth, Thou
<span class="add">art</span> a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec.
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C7V18">&nbsp;</a>For there is verily a disannulling of the commandment going before for the weakness and unprofitableness
thereof.
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C7V19">&nbsp;</a>For the law made nothing perfect, but the bringing in of a better hope
<span class="add">did;</span> by the which we draw nigh unto God.
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C7V20">&nbsp;</a>And inasmuch as not without an oath
<span class="add">he was made priest:
</span> <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C7V21">&nbsp;</a>(For those priests were made without an oath; but this with an oath by him that said unto him, The Lord
sware and will not repent, Thou
<span class="add">art</span> a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec:)
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C7V22">&nbsp;</a>By so much was Jesus made a surety of a better testament.
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C7V23">&nbsp;</a>And they truly were many priests, because they were not suffered to continue by reason of death:
 <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C7V24">&nbsp;</a>But this
<span class="add">man,</span> because he continueth ever, hath an unchangeable priesthood.
 <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C7V25">&nbsp;</a>Wherefore he is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by him, seeing he ever liveth
to make intercession for them.
 <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C7V26">&nbsp;</a>For such an high priest became us,
<span class="add">who is</span> holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners, and made higher than the heavens;
 <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C7V27">&nbsp;</a>Who needeth not daily, as those high priests, to offer up sacrifice, first for his own sins, and then
for the people’s: for this he did once, when he offered up himself.
 <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C7V28">&nbsp;</a>For the law maketh men high priests which have infirmity; but the word of the oath, which was since the
law,
<span class="add">maketh</span> the Son, who is consecrated for evermore.
