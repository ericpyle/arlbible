 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C4V1">&nbsp;</a>Now therefore hearken, O Israel, unto the statutes and unto the judgments, which I teach you, for to
do
<span class="add">them,</span> that ye may live, and go in and possess the land which the LORD God of your fathers giveth you.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C4V2">&nbsp;</a>Ye shall not add unto the word which I command you, neither shall ye diminish
<span class="add">ought</span> from it, that ye may keep the commandments of the LORD your God which I command you.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C4V3">&nbsp;</a>Your eyes have seen what the LORD did because of Baal-peor: for all the men that followed Baal-peor,
the LORD thy God hath destroyed them from among you.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C4V4">&nbsp;</a>But ye that did cleave unto the LORD your God
<span class="add">are</span> alive every one of you this day.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C4V5">&nbsp;</a>Behold, I have taught you statutes and judgments, even as the LORD my God commanded me, that ye should
do so in the land whither ye go to possess it.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C4V6">&nbsp;</a>Keep therefore and do
<span class="add">them;</span> for this
<span class="add">is</span> your wisdom and your understanding in the sight of the nations, which shall hear all these statutes,
and say, Surely this great nation
<span class="add">is</span> a wise and understanding people.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C4V7">&nbsp;</a>For what nation
<span class="add">is there so</span> great, who
<span class="add">hath</span> God
<span class="add">so</span> nigh unto them, as the LORD our God
<span class="add">is</span> in all
<span class="add">things that</span> we call upon him
<span class="add">for?
</span> <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C4V8">&nbsp;</a>And what nation
<span class="add">is there so</span> great, that hath statutes and judgments
<span class="add">so</span> righteous as all this law, which I set before you this day?
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C4V9">&nbsp;</a>Only take heed to thyself, and keep thy soul diligently, lest thou forget the things which thine eyes
have seen, and lest they depart from thy heart all the days of thy life: but teach them thy sons, and
thy sons’ sons;
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C4V10">&nbsp;</a><span class="add">Specially</span> the day that thou stoodest before the LORD thy God in Horeb, when the LORD said unto me, Gather me the
people together, and I will make them hear my words, that they may learn to fear me all the days that
they shall live upon the earth, and
<span class="add">that</span> they may teach their children.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C4V11">&nbsp;</a>And ye came near and stood under the mountain; and the mountain burned with fire unto the midst of heaven,
with darkness, clouds, and thick darkness.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C4V12">&nbsp;</a>And the LORD spake unto you out of the midst of the fire: ye heard the voice of the words, but saw no
similitude; only
<span class="add">ye heard</span> a voice.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C4V13">&nbsp;</a>And he declared unto you his covenant, which he commanded you to perform,
<span class="add">even</span> ten commandments; and he wrote them upon two tables of stone.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C4V14">&nbsp;</a>And the LORD commanded me at that time to teach you statutes and judgments, that ye might do them in
the land whither ye go over to possess it.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C4V15">&nbsp;</a>Take ye therefore good heed unto yourselves; for ye saw no manner of similitude on the day
<span class="add">that</span> the LORD spake unto you in Horeb out of the midst of the fire:
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C4V16">&nbsp;</a>Lest ye corrupt
<span class="add">yourselves,</span> and make you a graven image, the similitude of any figure, the likeness of male or female,
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C4V17">&nbsp;</a>The likeness of any beast that
<span class="add">is</span> on the earth, the likeness of any winged fowl that flieth in the air,
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C4V18">&nbsp;</a>The likeness of any thing that creepeth on the ground, the likeness of any fish that
<span class="add">is</span> in the waters beneath the earth:
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C4V19">&nbsp;</a>And lest thou lift up thine eyes unto heaven, and when thou seest the sun, and the moon, and the stars,
<span class="add">even</span> all the host of heaven, shouldest be driven to worship them, and serve them, which the LORD thy God
hath divided unto all nations under the whole heaven.
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C4V20">&nbsp;</a>But the LORD hath taken you, and brought you forth out of the iron furnace,
<span class="add">even</span> out of Egypt, to be unto him a people of inheritance, as
<span class="add">ye are</span> this day.
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C4V21">&nbsp;</a>Furthermore the LORD was angry with me for your sakes, and sware that I should not go over Jordan, and
that I should not go in unto that good land, which the LORD thy God giveth thee
<span class="add">for</span> an inheritance:
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C4V22">&nbsp;</a>But I must die in this land, I must not go over Jordan: but ye shall go over, and possess that good land.
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C4V23">&nbsp;</a>Take heed unto yourselves, lest ye forget the covenant of the LORD your God, which he made with you,
and make you a graven image,
<span class="add">or</span> the likeness of any
<span class="add">thing,</span> which the LORD thy God hath forbidden thee.
 <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C4V24">&nbsp;</a>For the LORD thy God
<span class="add">is</span> a consuming fire,
<span class="add">even</span> a jealous God.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C4V25">&nbsp;</a>When thou shalt beget children, and children’s children, and ye shall have remained long in the land,
and shall corrupt
<span class="add">yourselves,</span> and make a graven image,
<span class="add">or</span> the likeness of any
<span class="add">thing,</span> and shall do evil in the sight of the LORD thy God, to provoke him to anger:
 <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C4V26">&nbsp;</a>I call heaven and earth to witness against you this day, that ye shall soon utterly perish from off the
land whereunto ye go over Jordan to possess it; ye shall not prolong
<span class="add">your</span> days upon it, but shall utterly be destroyed.
 <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C4V27">&nbsp;</a>And the LORD shall scatter you among the nations, and ye shall be left few in number among the heathen,
whither the LORD shall lead you.
 <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C4V28">&nbsp;</a>And there ye shall serve gods, the work of men’s hands, wood and stone, which neither see, nor hear,
nor eat, nor smell.
 <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C4V29">&nbsp;</a>But if from thence thou shalt seek the LORD thy God, thou shalt find
<span class="add">him,</span> if thou seek him with all thy heart and with all thy soul.
 <span class="verse"> 30</span><a name="C4V30">&nbsp;</a>When thou art in tribulation, and all these things are come upon thee,
<span class="add">even</span> in the latter days, if thou turn to the LORD thy God, and shalt be obedient unto his voice;
 <span class="verse"> 31</span><a name="C4V31">&nbsp;</a>(For the LORD thy God
<span class="add">is</span> a merciful God;) he will not forsake thee, neither destroy thee, nor forget the covenant of thy fathers
which he sware unto them.
 <span class="verse"> 32</span><a name="C4V32">&nbsp;</a>For ask now of the days that are past, which were before thee, since the day that God created man upon
the earth, and
<span class="add">ask</span> from the one side of heaven unto the other, whether there hath been
<span class="add">any such thing</span> as this great thing
<span class="add">is,</span> or hath been heard like it?
 <span class="verse"> 33</span><a name="C4V33">&nbsp;</a>Did
<span class="add">ever</span> people hear the voice of God speaking out of the midst of the fire, as thou hast heard, and live?
 <span class="verse"> 34</span><a name="C4V34">&nbsp;</a>Or hath God assayed to go
<span class="add">and</span> take him a nation from the midst of another
<span class="add">nation,</span> by temptations, by signs, and by wonders, and by war, and by a mighty hand, and by a stretched out arm,
and by great terrors, according to all that the LORD your God did for you in Egypt before your eyes?
 <span class="verse"> 35</span><a name="C4V35">&nbsp;</a>Unto thee it was shewed, that thou mightest know that the LORD he
<span class="add">is</span> God;
<span class="add">there is</span> none else beside him.
 <span class="verse"> 36</span><a name="C4V36">&nbsp;</a>Out of heaven he made thee to hear his voice, that he might instruct thee: and upon earth he shewed thee
his great fire; and thou heardest his words out of the midst of the fire.
 <span class="verse"> 37</span><a name="C4V37">&nbsp;</a>And because he loved thy fathers, therefore he chose their seed after them, and brought thee out in his
sight with his mighty power out of Egypt;
 <span class="verse"> 38</span><a name="C4V38">&nbsp;</a>To drive out nations from before thee greater and mightier than thou
<span class="add">art,</span> to bring thee in, to give thee their land
<span class="add">for</span> an inheritance, as
<span class="add">it is</span> this day.
 <span class="verse"> 39</span><a name="C4V39">&nbsp;</a>Know therefore this day, and consider
<span class="add">it</span> in thine heart, that the LORD he
<span class="add">is</span> God in heaven above, and upon the earth beneath:
<span class="add">there is</span> none else.
 <span class="verse"> 40</span><a name="C4V40">&nbsp;</a>Thou shalt keep therefore his statutes, and his commandments, which I command thee this day, that it
may go well with thee, and with thy children after thee, and that thou mayest prolong
<span class="add">thy</span> days upon the earth, which the LORD thy God giveth thee, for ever.

<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 41</span><a name="C4V41">&nbsp;</a>Then Moses severed three cities on this side Jordan toward the sunrising;
 <span class="verse"> 42</span><a name="C4V42">&nbsp;</a>That the slayer might flee thither, which should kill his neighbour unawares, and hated him not in times
past; and that fleeing unto one of these cities he might live:
 <span class="verse"> 43</span><a name="C4V43">&nbsp;</a><span class="add">Namely,</span> Bezer in the wilderness, in the plain country, of the Reubenites; and Ramoth in Gilead, of the Gadites;

<span class="add">are</span> the testimonies, and the statutes, and the judgments, which Moses spake unto the children of Israel,
after they came forth out of Egypt,

who dwelt at Heshbon, whom Moses and the children of Israel smote, after they were come forth out of
Egypt:
 <span class="verse"> 47</span><a name="C4V47">&nbsp;</a>And they possessed his land, and the land of Og king of Bashan, two kings of the Amorites, which
<span class="add">were</span> on this side Jordan toward the sunrising;
 <span class="verse"> 48</span><a name="C4V48">&nbsp;</a>From Aroer, which

<span class="add">is</span> Hermon,
 <span class="verse"> 49</span><a name="C4V49">&nbsp;</a>And all the plain on this side Jordan eastward, even unto the sea of the plain, under the springs of
Pisgah.
