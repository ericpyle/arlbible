<div class="chapterlabel"> 7</div><div class="p">
 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C7V1">&nbsp;</a>Then came together unto him the Pharisees, and certain of the scribes, which came from Jerusalem.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C7V2">&nbsp;</a>And when they saw some of his disciples eat bread with defiled, that is to say, with unwashen, hands,
they found fault.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C7V3">&nbsp;</a>For the Pharisees, and all the Jews, except they wash
<span class="add">their</span> hands oft, eat not, holding the tradition of the elders.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C7V4">&nbsp;</a>And
<span class="add">when they come</span> from the market, except they wash, they eat not. And many other things there be, which they have received
to hold,
<span class="add">as</span> the washing of cups, and pots, brasen vessels, and of tables.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C7V5">&nbsp;</a>Then the Pharisees and scribes asked him, Why walk not thy disciples according to the tradition of the
elders, but eat bread with unwashen hands?
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C7V6">&nbsp;</a>He answered and said unto them,
<span class="wj">Well hath Esaias prophesied of you hypocrites, as it is written, This people honoureth me with
their lips, but their heart is far from me.
</span> <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C7V7">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Howbeit in vain do they worship me, teaching
for doctrines the commandments of men.
</span> <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C7V8">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">For laying aside the commandment of God, ye hold the tradition of men,
as the washing of pots and cups: and many other such like things ye do.
</span> <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C7V9">&nbsp;</a>And he said unto them,
<span class="wj">Full well ye reject the commandment of God, that ye may keep your own tradition.
</span> <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C7V10">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">For Moses said, Honour thy father and thy mother; and, Whoso curseth father or mother, let him die the
death:
</span> <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C7V11">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">But ye say, If a man shall say to his father or mother,
It is Corban, that is to say, a gift, by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me;
he shall be free.
</span> <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C7V12">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And ye suffer him no more to do ought for his father or his mother;
</span> <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C7V13">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Making the word of God of none effect through your tradition, which ye have delivered: and many such
like things do ye.</span></div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C7V14">&nbsp;</a>And when he had called all the people
<span class="add">unto him,</span> he said unto them,
<span class="wj">Hearken unto me every one
of you, and understand:
</span> <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C7V15">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">There is nothing from without a man, that entering into him can defile him: but the things which come
out of him, those are they that defile the man.
</span> <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C7V16">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">If any man have ears to hear, let him hear.
</span> <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C7V17">&nbsp;</a>And when he was entered into the house from the people, his disciples asked him concerning the parable.
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C7V18">&nbsp;</a>And he saith unto them,
<span class="wj">Are ye so without understanding also? Do ye not perceive, that whatsoever thing from without entereth
into the man,
it cannot defile him;
</span> <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C7V19">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Because it entereth not into his heart, but into the belly, and goeth out into the draught, purging all
meats?
</span> <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C7V20">&nbsp;</a>And he said,
<span class="wj">That which cometh out of the man, that defileth the man.
</span> <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C7V21">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">For from within, out of the heart of men, proceed evil thoughts, adulteries, fornications, murders,
</span> <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C7V22">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Thefts, covetousness, wickedness, deceit, lasciviousness, an evil eye, blasphemy, pride, foolishness:
</span> <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C7V23">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">All these evil things come from within, and defile the man.
</span></div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C7V24">&nbsp;</a>And from thence he arose, and went into the borders of Tyre and Sidon, and entered into an house, and
would have no man know
<span class="add">it:</span> but he could not be hid.
 <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C7V25">&nbsp;</a>For a
<span class="add">certain</span> woman, whose young daughter had an unclean spirit, heard of him, and came and fell at his feet:
 <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C7V26">&nbsp;</a>The woman was a Greek, a Syrophenician by nation; and she besought him that he would cast forth the devil
out of her daughter.
 <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C7V27">&nbsp;</a>But Jesus said unto her,
<span class="wj">Let the children first be filled: for it is not meet to take the children’s bread, and to cast
it unto the dogs.
</span> <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C7V28">&nbsp;</a>And she answered and said unto him, Yes, Lord: yet the dogs under the table eat of the children’s crumbs.
 <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C7V29">&nbsp;</a>And he said unto her,
<span class="wj">For this saying go thy way; the devil is gone out of thy daughter.
</span> <span class="verse"> 30</span><a name="C7V30">&nbsp;</a>And when she was come to her house, she found the devil gone out, and her daughter laid upon the bed.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 31</span><a name="C7V31">&nbsp;</a>And again, departing from the coasts of Tyre and Sidon, he came unto the sea of Galilee, through the
midst of the coasts of Decapolis.
 <span class="verse"> 32</span><a name="C7V32">&nbsp;</a>And they bring unto him one that was deaf, and had an impediment in his speech; and they beseech him
to put his hand upon him.
 <span class="verse"> 33</span><a name="C7V33">&nbsp;</a>And he took him aside from the multitude, and put his fingers into his ears, and he spit, and touched
his tongue;
 <span class="verse"> 34</span><a name="C7V34">&nbsp;</a>And looking up to heaven, he sighed, and saith unto him,
<span class="wj">Ephphatha,
</span> that is,
<span class="wj">Be opened.
</span> <span class="verse"> 35</span><a name="C7V35">&nbsp;</a>And straightway his ears were opened, and the string of his tongue was loosed, and he spake plain.
 <span class="verse"> 36</span><a name="C7V36">&nbsp;</a>And he charged them that they should tell no man: but the more he charged them, so much the more a great
deal they published
<span class="add">it;
</span> <span class="verse"> 37</span><a name="C7V37">&nbsp;</a>And were beyond measure astonished, saying, He hath done all things well: he maketh both the deaf to
hear, and the dumb to speak.
