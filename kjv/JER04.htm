Woe unto us! for we are spoiled.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>O Jerusalem, wash thine heart from wickedness, that thou mayest be saved. How long shall thy vain thoughts lodge within thee?  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>For a voice declareth from Dan, and publisheth affliction from mount Ephraim.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>Make ye mention to the nations; behold, publish against Jerusalem, <span class='add'>that</span> watchers come from a far country, and give out their voice against the cities of Judah.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>As keepers of a field, are they against her round about; because she hath been rebellious against me, saith the LORD.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>Thy way and thy doings have procured these <span class='add'>things</span> unto thee; this <span class='add'>is</span> thy wickedness, because it is bitter, because it reacheth unto thine heart. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>My bowels, my bowels! I am pained at my very heart; my heart maketh a noise in me; I cannot hold my peace, because thou hast heard, O my soul, the sound of the trump, the alarm of war.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>Destruction upon destruction is cried; for the whole land is spoiled: suddenly are my tents spoiled, <span class='add'>and</span> my curtains in a moment.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>How long shall I see the standard, <span class='add'>and</span> hear the sound of the trumpet?  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>For my people <span class='add'>is</span> foolish, they have not known me; they <span class='add'>are</span> sottish children, and they have none understanding: they <span class='add'>are</span> wise to do evil, but to do good they have no knowledge.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>I beheld the earth, and, lo, <span class='add'>it was</span> without form, and void; and the heavens, and they <span class='add'>had</span> no light.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>I beheld the mountains, and, lo, they trembled, and all the hills moved lightly.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>I beheld, and, lo, <span class='add'>there was</span> no man, and all the birds of the heavens were fled.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>I beheld, and, lo, the fruitful place <span class='add'>was</span> a wilderness, and all the cities thereof were broken down at the presence of the LORD, <span class='add'>and</span> by his fierce anger.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>For thus hath the LORD said, The whole land shall be desolate; yet will I not make a full end.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&nbsp;</span>For this shall the earth mourn, and the heavens above be black: because I have spoken <span class='add'>it</span>, I have purposed <span class='add'>it</span>, and will not repent, neither will I turn back from it.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&nbsp;</span>The whole city shall flee for the noise of the horsemen and bowmen; they shall go into thickets, and climb up upon the rocks: every city <span class='add'>shall be</span> forsaken, and not a man dwell therein.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&nbsp;</span>And <span class='add'>when</span> thou <span class='add'>art</span> spoiled, what wilt thou do? Though thou clothest thyself with crimson, though thou deckest thee with ornaments of gold, though thou rentest thy face with painting, in vain shalt thou make thyself fair; <span class='add'>thy</span> lovers will despise thee, they will seek thy life.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&nbsp;</span>For I have heard a voice as of a woman in travail, <span class='add'>and</span> the anguish as of her that bringeth forth her first child, the voice of the daughter of Zion, <span class='add'>that</span> bewaileth herself, <span class='add'>that</span> spreadeth her hands, <span class='add'>saying</span>, Woe <span class='add'>is</span> me now! for my soul is wearied because of murderers. </div><ul class='tnav'>
