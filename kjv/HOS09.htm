 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C9V1">&nbsp;</a>Rejoice not, O Israel, for joy, as
<span class="add">other</span> people: for thou hast gone a whoring from thy God, thou hast loved a reward upon every cornfloor.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C9V2">&nbsp;</a>The floor and the winepress shall not feed them, and the new wine shall fail in her.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C9V3">&nbsp;</a>They shall not dwell in the LORD’S land; but Ephraim shall return to Egypt, and they shall eat unclean
<span class="add">things</span> in Assyria.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C9V4">&nbsp;</a>They shall not offer wine
<span class="add">offerings</span> to the LORD, neither shall they be pleasing unto him: their sacrifices
<span class="add">shall be</span> unto them as the bread of mourners; all that eat thereof shall be polluted: for their bread for their
soul shall not come into the house of the LORD.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C9V5">&nbsp;</a>What will ye do in the solemn day, and in the day of the feast of the LORD?
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C9V6">&nbsp;</a>For, lo, they are gone because of destruction: Egypt shall gather them up, Memphis shall bury them: the
pleasant
<span class="add">places</span> for their silver, nettles shall possess them: thorns
<span class="add">shall be</span> in their tabernacles.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C9V7">&nbsp;</a>The days of visitation are come, the days of recompence are come; Israel shall know
<span class="add">it:</span> the prophet
<span class="add">is</span> a fool, the spiritual man
<span class="add">is</span> mad, for the multitude of thine iniquity, and the great hatred.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C9V8">&nbsp;</a>The watchman of Ephraim
<span class="add">was</span> with my God:
<span class="add">but</span> the prophet
<span class="add">is</span> a snare of a fowler in all his ways,
<span class="add">and</span> hatred in the house of his God.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C9V9">&nbsp;</a>They have deeply corrupted
<span class="add">themselves,</span> as in the days of Gibeah:
<span class="add">therefore</span> he will remember their iniquity, he will visit their sins.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C9V10">&nbsp;</a>I found Israel like grapes in the wilderness; I saw your fathers as the firstripe in the fig tree at
her first time:
<span class="add">but</span> they went to Baal-peor, and separated themselves unto
<span class="add">that</span> shame; and
<span class="add">their</span> abominations were according as they loved.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C9V11">&nbsp;</a><span class="add">As for</span> Ephraim, their glory shall fly away like a bird, from the birth, and from the womb, and from the conception.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C9V12">&nbsp;</a>Though they bring up their children, yet will I bereave them,
<span class="add">that there shall</span> not
<span class="add">be</span> a man
<span class="add">left:</span> yea, woe also to them when I depart from them!
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C9V13">&nbsp;</a>Ephraim, as I saw Tyrus,
<span class="add">is</span> planted in a pleasant place: but Ephraim shall bring forth his children to the murderer.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C9V14">&nbsp;</a>Give them, O LORD: what wilt thou give? give them a miscarrying womb and dry breasts.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C9V15">&nbsp;</a>All their wickedness
<span class="add">is</span> in Gilgal: for there I hated them: for the wickedness of their doings I will drive them out of mine
house, I will love them no more: all their princes
<span class="add">are</span> revolters.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C9V16">&nbsp;</a>Ephraim is smitten, their root is dried up, they shall bear no fruit: yea, though they bring forth, yet
will I slay
<span class="add">even</span> the beloved
<span class="add">fruit</span> of their womb.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C9V17">&nbsp;</a>My God will cast them away, because they did not hearken unto him: and they shall be wanderers among
the nations.
