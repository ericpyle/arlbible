 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C3V1">&nbsp;</a>For, behold, in those days, and in that time, when I shall bring again the captivity of Judah and Jerusalem,
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C3V2">&nbsp;</a>I will also gather all nations, and will bring them down into the valley of Jehoshaphat, and will plead
with them there for my people and
<span class="add">for</span> my heritage Israel, whom they have scattered among the nations, and parted my land.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C3V3">&nbsp;</a>And they have cast lots for my people; and have given a boy for an harlot, and sold a girl for wine,
that they might drink.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C3V4">&nbsp;</a>Yea, and what have ye to do with me, O Tyre, and Zidon, and all the coasts of Palestine? will ye render
me a recompence? and if ye recompense me, swiftly
<span class="add">and</span> speedily will I return your recompence upon your own head;
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C3V5">&nbsp;</a>Because ye have taken my silver and my gold, and have carried into your temples my goodly pleasant things:
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C3V6">&nbsp;</a>The children also of Judah and the children of Jerusalem have ye sold unto the Grecians, that ye might
remove them far from their border.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C3V7">&nbsp;</a>Behold, I will raise them out of the place whither ye have sold them, and will return your recompence
upon your own head:
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C3V8">&nbsp;</a>And I will sell your sons and your daughters into the hand of the children of Judah, and they shall sell
them to the Sabeans, to a people far off: for the LORD hath spoken
<span class="add">it.</span></div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C3V9">&nbsp;</a>Proclaim ye this among the Gentiles; Prepare war, wake up the mighty men, let all the men of war draw
near; let them come up:
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C3V10">&nbsp;</a>Beat your plowshares into swords, and your pruninghooks into spears: let the weak say, I
<span class="add">am</span> strong.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C3V11">&nbsp;</a>Assemble yourselves, and come, all ye heathen, and gather yourselves together round about: thither cause
thy mighty ones to come down, O LORD.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C3V12">&nbsp;</a>Let the heathen be wakened, and come up to the valley of Jehoshaphat: for there will I sit to judge all
the heathen round about.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C3V13">&nbsp;</a>Put ye in the sickle, for the harvest is ripe: come, get you down; for the press is full, the fats overflow;
for their wickedness
<span class="add">is</span> great.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C3V14">&nbsp;</a>Multitudes, multitudes in the valley of decision: for the day of the LORD
<span class="add">is</span> near in the valley of decision.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C3V15">&nbsp;</a>The sun and the moon shall be darkened, and the stars shall withdraw their shining.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C3V16">&nbsp;</a>The LORD also shall roar out of Zion, and utter his voice from Jerusalem; and the heavens and the earth
shall shake: but the LORD
<span class="add">will be</span> the hope of his people, and the strength of the children of Israel.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C3V17">&nbsp;</a>So shall ye know that I
<span class="add">am</span> the LORD your God dwelling in Zion, my holy mountain: then shall Jerusalem be holy, and there shall
no strangers pass through her any more.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C3V18">&nbsp;</a>And it shall come to pass in that day,
<span class="add">that</span> the mountains shall drop down new wine, and the hills shall flow with milk, and all the rivers of Judah
shall flow with waters, and a fountain shall come forth of the house of the LORD, and shall water the
valley of Shittim.
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C3V19">&nbsp;</a>Egypt shall be a desolation, and Edom shall be a desolate wilderness, for the violence
<span class="add">against</span> the children of Judah, because they have shed innocent blood in their land.
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C3V20">&nbsp;</a>But Judah shall dwell for ever, and Jerusalem from generation to generation.
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C3V21">&nbsp;</a>For I will cleanse their blood
<span class="add">that</span> I have not cleansed: for the LORD dwelleth in Zion.
