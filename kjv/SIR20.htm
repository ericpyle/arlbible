<div class="chapterlabel"> 20</div><div class="p">
 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C20V1">&nbsp;</a>There is a reproof that is not comely: again, some man holdeth his tongue, and he is wise.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C20V2">&nbsp;</a>It is much better to reprove, than to be angry secretly: and he that confesseth his fault shall be preserved
from hurt.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C20V3">&nbsp;</a>How good is it, when thou art reproved, to shew repentance! for so shalt thou escape wilful sin.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C20V4">&nbsp;</a>As is the lust of an eunuch to deflower a virgin; so is he that executeth judgment with violence.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C20V5">&nbsp;</a>There is one that keepeth silence, and is found wise: and another by much babbling becometh hateful.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C20V6">&nbsp;</a>Some man holdeth his tongue, because he hath not to answer: and some keepeth silence, knowing his time.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C20V7">&nbsp;</a>A wise man will hold his tongue till he see opportunity: but a babbler and a fool will regard no time.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C20V8">&nbsp;</a>He that useth many words shall be abhorred; and he that taketh to himself authority therein shall be
hated.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C20V9">&nbsp;</a>There is a sinner that hath good success in evil things; and there is a gain that turneth to loss.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C20V10">&nbsp;</a>There is a gift that shall not profit thee; and there is a gift whose recompence is double.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C20V11">&nbsp;</a>There is an abasement because of glory; and there is that lifteth up his head from a low estate.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C20V12">&nbsp;</a>There is that buyeth much for a little, and repayeth it sevenfold.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C20V13">&nbsp;</a>A wise man by his words maketh him beloved: but the graces of fools shall be poured out.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C20V14">&nbsp;</a>The gift of a fool shall do thee no good when thou hast it; neither yet of the envious for his necessity:
for he looketh to receive many things for one.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C20V15">&nbsp;</a>He giveth little, and upbraideth much; he openeth his mouth like a crier; to day he lendeth, and to morrow
will he ask it again: such an one is to be hated of God and man.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C20V16">&nbsp;</a>The fool saith, I have no friends, I have no thank for all my good deeds, and they that eat my bread
speak evil of me.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C20V17">&nbsp;</a>How oft, and of how many shall he be laughed to scorn! for he knoweth not aright what it is to have;
and it is all one unto him as if he had it not.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C20V18">&nbsp;</a>To slip upon a pavement is better than to slip with the tongue: so the fall of the wicked shall come
speedily.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C20V19">&nbsp;</a>An unseasonable tale will always be in the mouth of the unwise.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C20V20">&nbsp;</a>A wise sentence shall be rejected when it cometh out of a fool’s mouth; for he will not speak it in due
season.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C20V21">&nbsp;</a>There is that is hindered from sinning through want: and when he taketh rest, he shall not be troubled.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C20V22">&nbsp;</a>There is that destroyeth his own soul through bashfulness, and by accepting of persons overthroweth himself.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C20V23">&nbsp;</a>There is that for bashfulness promiseth to his friend, and maketh him his enemy for nothing.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C20V24">&nbsp;</a>A lie is a foul blot in a man, yet it is continually in the mouth of the untaught.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C20V25">&nbsp;</a>A thief is better than a man that is accustomed to lie: but they both shall have destruction to heritage.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C20V26">&nbsp;</a>The disposition of a liar is dishonourable, and his shame is ever with him.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C20V27">&nbsp;</a>A wise man shall promote himself to honour with his words: and he that hath understanding will please
great men.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C20V28">&nbsp;</a>He that tilleth his land shall increase his heap: and he that pleaseth great men shall get pardon for
iniquity.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C20V29">&nbsp;</a>Presents and gifts blind the eyes of the wise, and stop up his mouth that he cannot reprove.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 30</span><a name="C20V30">&nbsp;</a>Wisdom that is hid, and treasure that is hoarded up, what profit is in them both?
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 31</span><a name="C20V31">&nbsp;</a>Better is he that hideth his folly than a man that hideth his wisdom.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 32</span><a name="C20V32">&nbsp;</a>Necessary patience in seeking ing the Lord is better than he that leadeth his life without a guide.
