<div class="chapterlabel"> 9</div><div class="p">
 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C9V1">&nbsp;</a>O God of my fathers, and Lord of mercy, who hast made all things with thy word,
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C9V2">&nbsp;</a>And ordained man through thy wisdom, that he should have dominion over the creatures which thou hast
made,
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C9V3">&nbsp;</a>And order the world according to equity and righteousness, and execute judgment with an upright heart:
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C9V4">&nbsp;</a>Give me wisdom, that sitteth by thy throne; and reject me not from among thy children:
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C9V5">&nbsp;</a>For I thy servant and son of thine handmaid am a feeble person, and of a short time, and too young for
the understanding of judgment and laws.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C9V6">&nbsp;</a>For though a man be never so perfect among the children of men, yet if thy wisdom be not with him, he
shall be nothing regarded.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C9V7">&nbsp;</a>Thou hast chosen me to be a king of thy people, and a judge of thy sons and daughters:
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C9V8">&nbsp;</a>Thou hast commanded me to build a temple upon thy holy mount, and an altar in the city wherein thou dwellest,
a resemblance of the holy tabernacle, which thou hast prepared from the beginning.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C9V9">&nbsp;</a>And wisdom was with thee: which knoweth thy works, and was present when thou madest the world, and knew
what was acceptable in thy sight, and right in thy commandments.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C9V10">&nbsp;</a>O send her out of thy holy heavens, and from the throne of thy glory, that being present she may labour
with me, that I may know what is pleasing unto thee.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C9V11">&nbsp;</a>For she knoweth and understandeth all things, and she shall lead me soberly in my doings, and preserve
me in her power.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C9V12">&nbsp;</a>So shall my works be acceptable, and then shall I judge thy people righteously, and be worthy to sit
in my father’s seat.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C9V13">&nbsp;</a>For what man is he that can know the counsel of God? or who can think what the will of the Lord is?
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C9V14">&nbsp;</a>For the thoughts of mortal men are miserable, and our devices are but uncertain.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C9V15">&nbsp;</a>For the corruptible body presseth down the soul, and the earthy tabernacle weigheth down the mind that
museth upon many things.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C9V16">&nbsp;</a>And hardly do we guess aright at things that are upon earth, and with labour do we find the things that
are before us: but the things that are in heaven who hath searched out?
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C9V17">&nbsp;</a>And thy counsel who hath known, except thou give wisdom, and send thy Holy Spirit from above?
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C9V18">&nbsp;</a>For so the ways of them which lived on the earth were reformed, and men were taught the things that are
pleasing unto thee, and were saved through wisdom.
