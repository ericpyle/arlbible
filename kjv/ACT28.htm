 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C28V1">&nbsp;</a>And when they were escaped, then they knew that the island was called Melita.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C28V2">&nbsp;</a>And the barbarous people shewed us no little kindness: for they kindled a fire, and received us every
one, because of the present rain, and because of the cold.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C28V3">&nbsp;</a>And when Paul had gathered a bundle of sticks, and laid
<span class="add">them</span> on the fire, there came a viper out of the heat, and fastened on his hand.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C28V4">&nbsp;</a>And when the barbarians saw the
<span class="add">venomous</span> beast hang on his hand, they said among themselves, No doubt this man is a murderer, whom, though he
hath escaped the sea, yet vengeance suffereth not to live.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C28V5">&nbsp;</a>And he shook off the beast into the fire, and felt no harm.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C28V6">&nbsp;</a>Howbeit they looked when he should have swollen, or fallen down dead suddenly: but after they had looked
a great while, and saw no harm come to him, they changed their minds, and said that he was a god.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C28V7">&nbsp;</a>In the same quarters were possessions of the chief man of the island, whose name was Publius; who received
us, and lodged us three days courteously.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C28V8">&nbsp;</a>And it came to pass, that the father of Publius lay sick of a fever and of a bloody flux: to whom Paul
entered in, and prayed, and laid his hands on him, and healed him.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C28V9">&nbsp;</a>So when this was done, others also, which had diseases in the island, came, and were healed:
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C28V10">&nbsp;</a>Who also honoured us with many honours; and when we departed, they laded
<span class="add">us</span> with such things as were necessary.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C28V11">&nbsp;</a>And after three months we departed in a ship of Alexandria, which had wintered in the isle, whose sign
was Castor and Pollux.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C28V12">&nbsp;</a>And landing at Syracuse, we tarried
<span class="add">there</span> three days.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C28V13">&nbsp;</a>And from thence we fetched a compass, and came to Rhegium: and after one day the south wind blew, and
we came the next day to Puteoli:
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C28V14">&nbsp;</a>Where we found brethren, and were desired to tarry with them seven days: and so we went toward Rome.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C28V15">&nbsp;</a>And from thence, when the brethren heard of us, they came to meet us as far as Appii Forum, and The three
taverns: whom when Paul saw, he thanked God, and took courage.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C28V16">&nbsp;</a>And when we came to Rome, the centurion delivered the prisoners to the captain of the guard: but Paul
was suffered to dwell by himself with a soldier that kept him.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C28V17">&nbsp;</a>And it came to pass, that after three days Paul called the chief of the Jews together: and when they
were come together, he said unto them, Men
<span class="add">and</span> brethren, though I have committed nothing against the people, or customs of our fathers, yet was I delivered
prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans.
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C28V18">&nbsp;</a>Who, when they had examined me, would have let
<span class="add">me</span> go, because there was no cause of death in me.
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C28V19">&nbsp;</a>But when the Jews spake against
<span class="add">it,</span> I was constrained to appeal unto Caesar; not that I had ought to accuse my nation of.
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C28V20">&nbsp;</a>For this cause therefore have I called for you, to see
<span class="add">you,</span> and to speak with
<span class="add">you:</span> because that for the hope of Israel I am bound with this chain.
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C28V21">&nbsp;</a>And they said unto him, We neither received letters out of Judaea concerning thee, neither any of the
brethren that came shewed or spake any harm of thee.
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C28V22">&nbsp;</a>But we desire to hear of thee what thou thinkest: for as concerning this sect, we know that every where
it is spoken against.
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C28V23">&nbsp;</a>And when they had appointed him a day, there came many to him into
<span class="add">his</span> lodging; to whom he expounded and testified the kingdom of God, persuading them concerning Jesus, both
out of the law of Moses, and
<span class="add">out of</span> the prophets, from morning till evening.
 <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C28V24">&nbsp;</a>And some believed the things which were spoken, and some believed not.
 <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C28V25">&nbsp;</a>And when they agreed not among themselves, they departed, after that Paul had spoken one word, Well spake
the Holy Ghost by Esaias the prophet unto our fathers,
 <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C28V26">&nbsp;</a>Saying, Go unto this people, and say, Hearing ye shall hear, and shall not understand; and seeing ye
shall see, and not perceive:
 <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C28V27">&nbsp;</a>For the heart of this people is waxed gross, and their ears are dull of hearing, and their eyes have
they closed; lest they should see with
<span class="add">their</span> eyes, and hear with
<span class="add">their</span> ears, and understand with
<span class="add">their</span> heart, and should be converted, and I should heal them.
 <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C28V28">&nbsp;</a>Be it known therefore unto you, that the salvation of God is sent unto the Gentiles, and
<span class="add">that</span> they will hear it.
 <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C28V29">&nbsp;</a>And when he had said these words, the Jews departed, and had great reasoning among themselves.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 30</span><a name="C28V30">&nbsp;</a>And Paul dwelt two whole years in his own hired house, and received all that came in unto him,
 <span class="verse"> 31</span><a name="C28V31">&nbsp;</a>Preaching the kingdom of God, and teaching those things which concern the Lord Jesus Christ, with all
confidence, no man forbidding him.
