 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C4V1">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And he began again to teach by the sea side: and there was gathered unto him a great multitude, so that
he entered into a ship, and sat in the sea; and the whole multitude was by the sea on the land.
</span> <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C4V2">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And he taught them many things by parables, and said unto them in his doctrine,
</span> <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C4V3">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Hearken; Behold, there went out a sower to sow:
</span> <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C4V4">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And it came to pass, as he sowed, some fell by the way side, and the fowls of the air came and devoured
it up.
</span> <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C4V5">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And some fell on stony ground, where it had not much earth; and immediately it sprang up, because it
had no depth of earth:
</span> <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C4V6">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">But when the sun was up, it was scorched; and because it had no root, it withered away.
</span> <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C4V7">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And some fell among thorns, and the thorns grew up, and choked it, and it yielded no fruit.
</span> <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C4V8">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And other fell on good ground, and did yield fruit that sprang up and increased; and brought forth, some
thirty, and some sixty, and some an hundred.
</span> <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C4V9">&nbsp;</a>And he said unto them,
<span class="wj">He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.
</span> <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C4V10">&nbsp;</a>And when he was alone, they that were about him with the twelve asked of him the parable.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C4V11">&nbsp;</a>And he said unto them,
<span class="wj">Unto you it is given to know the mystery of the kingdom of God: but unto them that are without, all these
</span><span class="add">things
</span><span class="wj"> are done in parables:
</span> <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C4V12">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">That seeing they may see, and not perceive; and hearing they may hear, and not understand; lest at any
time they should be converted, and
</span><span class="add">their</span><span class="wj"> sins should be forgiven them.
</span> <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C4V13">&nbsp;</a>And he said unto them,
<span class="wj">Know ye not this parable? and how then will ye know all parables?</span></div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C4V14">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">The sower soweth the word.
</span> <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C4V15">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And these are they by the way side, where the word is sown; but when they have heard, Satan cometh immediately,
and taketh away the word that was sown in their hearts.
</span> <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C4V16">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And these are they likewise which are sown on stony ground; who, when they have heard the word, immediately
receive it with gladness;
</span> <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C4V17">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And have no root in themselves, and so endure but for a time: afterward, when affliction or persecution
ariseth for the word’s sake, immediately they are offended.
</span> <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C4V18">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And these are they which are sown among thorns; such as hear the word,
</span> <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C4V19">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And the cares of this world, and the deceitfulness of riches, and the lusts of other things entering
in, choke the word, and it becometh unfruitful.
</span> <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C4V20">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And these are they which are sown on good ground; such as hear the word, and receive
</span><span class="add">it,</span><span class="wj"> and bring forth fruit, some thirtyfold, some sixty, and some an hundred.</span></div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C4V21">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And he said unto them, Is a candle brought to be put under a bushel, or under a bed? and not to be set
on a candlestick?
</span> <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C4V22">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">For there is nothing hid, which shall not be manifested; neither was any thing kept secret, but that
it should come abroad.
</span> <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C4V23">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">If any man have ears to hear, let him hear.
</span> <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C4V24">&nbsp;</a>And he said unto them,
<span class="wj">Take heed what ye hear: with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you: and unto you that hear
shall more be given.
</span> <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C4V25">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">For he that hath, to him shall be given: and he that hath not, from him shall be taken even that which
he hath.
</span> <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C4V26">&nbsp;</a>And he said,
<span class="wj">So is the kingdom of God, as if a man should cast seed into the ground;
</span> <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C4V27">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And should sleep, and rise night and day, and the seed should spring and grow up, he knoweth not how.
</span> <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C4V28">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">For the earth bringeth forth fruit of herself; first the blade, then the ear, after that the full corn
in the ear.
</span> <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C4V29">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">But when the fruit is brought forth, immediately he putteth in the sickle, because the harvest is come.</span></div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 30</span><a name="C4V30">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And he said, Whereunto shall we liken the kingdom of God? or with what comparison shall we compare it?
</span> <span class="verse"> 31</span><a name="C4V31">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj"></span><span class="add">It is</span><span class="wj"> like a grain of mustard seed, which, when it is sown in the earth, is less than all the seeds that be
in the earth:
</span> <span class="verse"> 32</span><a name="C4V32">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">But when it is sown, it groweth up, and becometh greater than all herbs, and shooteth out great branches;
so that the fowls of the air may lodge under the shadow of it.
</span> <span class="verse"> 33</span><a name="C4V33">&nbsp;</a>And with many such parables spake he the word unto them, as they were able to hear
<span class="add">it.
</span> <span class="verse"> 34</span><a name="C4V34">&nbsp;</a>But without a parable spake he not unto them: and when they were alone, he expounded all things to his
disciples.
 <span class="verse"> 35</span><a name="C4V35">&nbsp;</a>And the same day, when the even was come, he saith unto them,
<span class="wj">Let us pass over unto the other side.
</span> <span class="verse"> 36</span><a name="C4V36">&nbsp;</a>And when they had sent away the multitude, they took him even as he was in the ship. And there were also
with him other little ships.
 <span class="verse"> 37</span><a name="C4V37">&nbsp;</a>And there arose a great storm of wind, and the waves beat into the ship, so that it was now full.
 <span class="verse"> 38</span><a name="C4V38">&nbsp;</a>And he was in the hinder part of the ship, asleep on a pillow: and they awake him, and say unto him,
Master, carest thou not that we perish?
 <span class="verse"> 39</span><a name="C4V39">&nbsp;</a>And he arose, and rebuked the wind, and said unto the sea,
<span class="wj">Peace, be still.</span> And the wind ceased, and there was a great calm.
 <span class="verse"> 40</span><a name="C4V40">&nbsp;</a>And he said unto them,
<span class="wj">Why are ye so fearful? how is it that ye have no faith?
</span> <span class="verse"> 41</span><a name="C4V41">&nbsp;</a>And they feared exceedingly, and said one to another, What manner of man is this, that even the wind
and the sea obey him?
