<div class="chapterlabel"> 9</div><div class="p">
 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C9V1">&nbsp;</a>Now in the twelfth month, that
<span class="add">is,</span> the month Adar, on the thirteenth day of the same, when the king’s commandment and his decree drew near
to be put in execution, in the day that the enemies of the Jews hoped to have power over them, (though
it was turned to the contrary, that the Jews had rule over them that hated them;)
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C9V2">&nbsp;</a>The Jews gathered themselves together in their cities throughout all the provinces of the king Ahasuerus,
to lay hand on such as sought their hurt: and no man could withstand them; for the fear of them fell
upon all people.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C9V3">&nbsp;</a>And all the rulers of the provinces, and the lieutenants, and the deputies, and officers of the king,
helped the Jews; because the fear of Mordecai fell upon them.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C9V4">&nbsp;</a>For Mordecai
<span class="add">was</span> great in the king’s house, and his fame went out throughout all the provinces: for this man Mordecai
waxed greater and greater.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C9V5">&nbsp;</a>Thus the Jews smote all their enemies with the stroke of the sword, and slaughter, and destruction, and
did what they would unto those that hated them.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C9V6">&nbsp;</a>And in Shushan the palace the Jews slew and destroyed five hundred men.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C9V7">&nbsp;</a>And Parshandatha, and Dalphon, and Aspatha,
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C9V8">&nbsp;</a>And Poratha, and Adalia, and Aridatha,
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C9V9">&nbsp;</a>And Parmashta, and Arisai, and Aridai, and Vajezatha,
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C9V10">&nbsp;</a>The ten sons of Haman the son of Hammedatha, the enemy of the Jews, slew they; but on the spoil laid
they not their hand.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C9V11">&nbsp;</a>On that day the number of those that were slain in Shushan the palace was brought before the king.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C9V12">&nbsp;</a>And the king said unto Esther the queen, The Jews have slain and destroyed five hundred men in Shushan
the palace, and the ten sons of Haman; what have they done in the rest of the king’s provinces? now what
<span class="add">is
</span> thy petition? and it shall be granted thee: or what
<span class="add">is</span> thy request further? and it shall be done.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C9V13">&nbsp;</a>Then said Esther, If it please the king, let it be granted to the Jews which
<span class="add">are</span> in Shushan to do to morrow also according unto this day’s decree, and let Haman’s ten sons be hanged
upon the gallows.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C9V14">&nbsp;</a>And the king commanded it so to be done: and the decree was given at Shushan; and they hanged Haman’s
ten sons.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C9V15">&nbsp;</a>For the Jews that
<span class="add">were</span> in Shushan gathered themselves together on the fourteenth day also of the month Adar, and slew three
hundred men at Shushan; but on the prey they laid not their hand.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C9V16">&nbsp;</a>But the other Jews that
<span class="add">were</span> in the king’s provinces gathered themselves together, and stood for their lives, and had rest from their
enemies, and slew of their foes seventy and five thousand, but they laid not their hands on the prey,
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C9V17">&nbsp;</a>On the thirteenth day of the month Adar; and on the fourteenth day of the same rested they, and made
it a day of feasting and gladness.
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C9V18">&nbsp;</a>But the Jews that
<span class="add">were</span> at Shushan assembled together on the thirteenth
<span class="add">day</span> thereof; and on the fourteenth thereof; and on the fifteenth
<span class="add">day</span> of the same they rested, and made it a day of feasting and gladness.
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C9V19">&nbsp;</a>Therefore the Jews of the villages, that dwelt in the unwalled towns, made the fourteenth day of the
month Adar
<span class="add">a day of</span> gladness and feasting, and a good day, and of sending portions one to another.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C9V20">&nbsp;</a>And Mordecai wrote these things, and sent letters unto all the Jews that
<span class="add">were</span> in all the provinces of the king Ahasuerus,
<span class="add">both
</span> nigh and far,
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C9V21">&nbsp;</a>To stablish
<span class="add">this</span> among them, that they should keep the fourteenth day of the month Adar, and the fifteenth day of the
same, yearly,
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C9V22">&nbsp;</a>As the days wherein the Jews rested from their enemies, and the month which was turned unto them from
sorrow to joy, and from mourning into a good day: that they should make them days of feasting and joy,
and of sending portions one to another, and gifts to the poor.
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C9V23">&nbsp;</a>And the Jews undertook to do as they had begun, and as Mordecai had written unto them;
 <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C9V24">&nbsp;</a>Because Haman the son of Hammedatha, the Agagite, the enemy of all the Jews, had devised against the
Jews to destroy them, and had cast Pur, that
<span class="add">is,</span> the lot, to consume them, and to destroy them;
 <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C9V25">&nbsp;</a>But when
<span class="add">Esther</span> came before the king, he commanded by letters that his wicked device, which he devised against the Jews,
should return upon his own head, and that he and his sons should be hanged on the gallows.
 <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C9V26">&nbsp;</a>Wherefore they called these days Purim after the name of Pur. Therefore for all the words of this letter,
and
<span class="add">of that</span> which they had seen concerning this matter, and which had come unto them,
 <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C9V27">&nbsp;</a>The Jews ordained, and took upon them, and upon their seed, and upon all such as joined themselves unto
them, so as it should not fail, that they would keep these two days according to their writing, and according
to their
<span class="add">appointed</span> time every year;
 <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C9V28">&nbsp;</a>And
<span class="add">that</span> these days
<span class="add">should be</span> remembered and kept throughout every generation, every family, every province, and every city; and
<span class="add">that</span> these days of Purim should not fail from among the Jews, nor the memorial of them perish from their
seed.
 <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C9V29">&nbsp;</a>Then Esther the queen, the daughter of Abihail, and Mordecai the Jew, wrote with all authority, to confirm
this second letter of Purim.
 <span class="verse"> 30</span><a name="C9V30">&nbsp;</a>And he sent the letters unto all the Jews, to the hundred twenty and seven provinces of the kingdom of
Ahasuerus,
<span class="add">with</span> words of peace and truth,
 <span class="verse"> 31</span><a name="C9V31">&nbsp;</a>To confirm these days of Purim in their times
<span class="add">appointed,
</span> according as Mordecai the Jew and Esther the queen had enjoined them, and as they had decreed for themselves
and for their seed, the matters of the fastings and their cry.
 <span class="verse"> 32</span><a name="C9V32">&nbsp;</a>And the decree of Esther confirmed these matters of Purim; and it was written in the book.
