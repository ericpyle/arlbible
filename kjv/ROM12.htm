 <span class="verse" id="V1">1&nbsp;</span> I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, <span class='add'>which is</span> your reasonable service.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span> And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what <span class='add'>is</span> that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span> For I say, through the grace given unto me, to every man that is among you, not to think <span class='add'>of himself</span> more highly than he ought to think; but to think soberly, according as God hath dealt to every man the measure of faith.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span> For as we have many members in one body, and all members have not the same office:  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span> So we, <span class='add'>being</span> many, are one body in Christ, and every one members one of another.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span> Having then gifts differing according to the grace that is given to us, whether prophecy, <span class='add'>let us prophesy</span> according to the proportion of faith;  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span> Or ministry, <span class='add'>let us wait</span> on <span class='add'>our</span> ministering: or he that teacheth, on teaching;  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span> Or he that exhorteth, on exhortation: he that giveth, <span class='add'>let him do it</span> with simplicity; he that ruleth, with diligence; he that sheweth mercy, with cheerfulness. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span> <span class='add'>Let</span> love be without dissimulation. Abhor that which is evil; cleave to that which is good.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span> <span class='add'>Be</span> kindly affectioned one to another with brotherly love; in honour preferring one another;  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span> Not slothful in business; fervent in spirit; serving the Lord;  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span> Rejoicing in hope; patient in tribulation; continuing instant in prayer;  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span> Distributing to the necessity of saints; given to hospitality.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span> Bless them which persecute you: bless, and curse not.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span> Rejoice with them that do rejoice, and weep with them that weep.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span> <span class='add'>Be</span> of the same mind one toward another. Mind not high things, but condescend to men of low estate. Be not wise in your own conceits.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span> Recompense to no man evil for evil. Provide things honest in the sight of all men.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span> If it be possible, as much as lieth in you, live peaceably with all men.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span> Dearly beloved, avenge not yourselves, but <span class='add'>rather</span> give place unto wrath: for it is written, Vengeance <span class='add'>is</span> mine; I will repay, saith the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span> Therefore if thine enemy hunger, feed him; if he thirst, give him drink: for in so doing thou shalt heap coals of fire on his head.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span> Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good. </div><ul class='tnav'>
