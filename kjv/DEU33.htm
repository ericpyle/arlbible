 <span class="verse" id="V1">1&nbsp;</span>And this <span class='add'>is</span> the blessing, wherewith Moses the man of God blessed the children of Israel before his death.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span>And he said, The LORD came from Sinai, and rose up from Seir unto them; he shined forth from mount Paran, and he came with ten thousands of saints: from his right hand <span class='add'>went</span> a fiery law for them.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>Yea, he loved the people; all his saints <span class='add'>are</span> in thy hand: and they sat down at thy feet; <span class='add'>every one</span> shall receive of thy words.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>Moses commanded us a law, <span class='add'>even</span> the inheritance of the congregation of Jacob.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>And he was king in Jeshurun, when the heads of the people <span class='add'>and</span> the tribes of Israel were gathered together. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>Let Reuben live, and not die; and let <span class='add'>not</span> his men be few. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>And this <span class='add'>is the blessing</span> of Judah: and he said, Hear, LORD, the voice of Judah, and bring him unto his people: let his hands be sufficient for him; and be thou an help <span class='add'>to him</span> from his enemies.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>And of Levi he said, <span class='add'>Let</span> thy Thummim and thy Urim <span class='add'>be</span> with thy holy one, whom thou didst prove at Massah, <span class='add'>and with</span> whom thou didst strive at the waters of Meribah;  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>Who said unto his father and to his mother, I have not seen him; neither did he acknowledge his brethren, nor knew his own children: for they have observed thy word, and kept thy covenant.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>They shall teach Jacob thy judgments, and Israel thy law: they shall put incense before thee, and whole burnt sacrifice upon thine altar.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>Bless, LORD, his substance, and accept the work of his hands: smite through the loins of them that rise against him, and of them that hate him, that they rise not again. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span> <span class='add'>And</span> of Benjamin he said, The beloved of the LORD shall dwell in safety by him; <span class='add'>and the LORD</span> shall cover him all the day long, and he shall dwell between his shoulders. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>And of Joseph he said, Blessed of the LORD <span class='add'>be</span> his land, for the precious things of heaven, for the dew, and for the deep that coucheth beneath,  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>And for the precious fruits <span class='add'>brought forth</span> by the sun, and for the precious things put forth by the moon,  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>And for the chief things of the ancient mountains, and for the precious things of the lasting hills,  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>And for the precious things of the earth and fulness thereof, and <span class='add'>for</span> the good will of him that dwelt in the bush: let <span class='add'>the blessing</span> come upon the head of Joseph, and upon the top of the head of him <span class='add'>that was</span> separated from his brethren.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>His glory <span class='add'>is like</span> the firstling of his bullock, and his horns <span class='add'>are like</span> the horns of unicorns: with them he shall push the people together to the ends of the earth: and they <span class='add'>are</span> the ten thousands of Ephraim, and they <span class='add'>are</span> the thousands of Manasseh. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>And of Zebulun he said, Rejoice, Zebulun, in thy going out; and, Issachar, in thy tents.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>They shall call the people unto the mountain; there they shall offer sacrifices of righteousness: for they shall suck <span class='add'>of</span> the abundance of the seas, and <span class='add'>of</span> treasures hid in the sand. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>And of Gad he said, Blessed <span class='add'>be</span> he that enlargeth Gad: he dwelleth as a lion, and teareth the arm with the crown of the head.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>And he provided the first part for himself, because there, <span class='add'>in</span> a portion of the lawgiver, <span class='add'>was he</span> seated; and he came with the heads of the people, he executed the justice of the LORD, and his judgments with Israel. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>And of Dan he said, Dan <span class='add'>is</span> a lion’s whelp: he shall leap from Bashan. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>And of Naphtali he said, O Naphtali, satisfied with favour, and full with the blessing of the LORD: possess thou the west and the south. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>And of Asher he said, <span class='add'>Let</span> Asher <span class='add'>be</span> blessed with children; let him be acceptable to his brethren, and let him dip his foot in oil.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>Thy shoes <span class='add'>shall be</span> iron and brass; and as thy days, <span class='add'>so shall</span> thy strength <span class='add'>be</span>. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span> <span class='add'>There is</span> none like unto the God of Jeshurun, <span class='add'>who</span> rideth upon the heaven in thy help, and in his excellency on the sky.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>The eternal God <span class='add'>is thy</span> refuge, and underneath <span class='add'>are</span> the everlasting arms: and he shall thrust out the enemy from before thee;

also his heavens shall drop down dew.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&nbsp;</span>Happy <span class='add'>art</span> thou, O Israel: who <span class='add'>is</span> like unto thee, O people saved by the LORD, the shield of thy help, and who <span class='add'>is</span> the sword of thy excellency! and thine enemies shall be found liars unto thee; and thou shalt tread upon their high places. </div><ul class='tnav'>
