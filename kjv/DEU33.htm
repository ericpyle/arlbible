 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C33V1">&nbsp;</a>And this
<span class="add">is</span> the blessing, wherewith Moses the man of God blessed the children of Israel before his death.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C33V2">&nbsp;</a>And he said, The LORD came from Sinai, and rose up from Seir unto them; he shined forth from mount Paran,
and he came with ten thousands of saints: from his right hand
<span class="add">went</span> a fiery law for them.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C33V3">&nbsp;</a>Yea, he loved the people; all his saints
<span class="add">are</span> in thy hand: and they sat down at thy feet;
<span class="add">every one</span> shall receive of thy words.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C33V4">&nbsp;</a>Moses commanded us a law,
<span class="add">even</span> the inheritance of the congregation of Jacob.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C33V5">&nbsp;</a>And he was king in Jeshurun, when the heads of the people
<span class="add">and</span> the tribes of Israel were gathered together.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C33V6">&nbsp;</a>Let Reuben live, and not die; and let
<span class="add">not</span> his men be few.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C33V7">&nbsp;</a>And this
<span class="add">is the blessing</span> of Judah: and he said, Hear, LORD, the voice of Judah, and bring him unto his people: let his hands
be sufficient for him; and be thou an help
<span class="add">to him</span> from his enemies.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C33V8">&nbsp;</a>And of Levi he said,
<span class="add">Let</span> thy Thummim and thy Urim
<span class="add">be</span> with thy holy one, whom thou didst prove at Massah,
<span class="add">and with</span> whom thou didst strive at the waters of Meribah;
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C33V9">&nbsp;</a>Who said unto his father and to his mother, I have not seen him; neither did he acknowledge his brethren,
nor knew his own children: for they have observed thy word, and kept thy covenant.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C33V10">&nbsp;</a>They shall teach Jacob thy judgments, and Israel thy law: they shall put incense before thee, and whole
burnt sacrifice upon thine altar.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C33V11">&nbsp;</a>Bless, LORD, his substance, and accept the work of his hands: smite through the loins of them that rise
against him, and of them that hate him, that they rise not again.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C33V12">&nbsp;</a><span class="add">And</span> of Benjamin he said, The beloved of the LORD shall dwell in safety by him;
<span class="add">and the LORD</span> shall cover him all the day long, and he shall dwell between his shoulders.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C33V13">&nbsp;</a>And of Joseph he said, Blessed of the LORD
<span class="add">be</span> his land, for the precious things of heaven, for the dew, and for the deep that coucheth beneath,
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C33V14">&nbsp;</a>And for the precious fruits
<span class="add">brought forth</span> by the sun, and for the precious things put forth by the moon,
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C33V15">&nbsp;</a>And for the chief things of the ancient mountains, and for the precious things of the lasting hills,
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C33V16">&nbsp;</a>And for the precious things of the earth and fulness thereof, and
<span class="add">for</span> the good will of him that dwelt in the bush: let
<span class="add">the blessing</span> come upon the head of Joseph, and upon the top of the head of him
<span class="add">that was</span> separated from his brethren.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C33V17">&nbsp;</a>His glory
<span class="add">is like</span> the firstling of his bullock, and his horns
<span class="add">are like</span> the horns of unicorns: with them he shall push the people together to the ends of the earth: and they
<span class="add">are</span> the ten thousands of Ephraim, and they
<span class="add">are</span> the thousands of Manasseh.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C33V18">&nbsp;</a>And of Zebulun he said, Rejoice, Zebulun, in thy going out; and, Issachar, in thy tents.
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C33V19">&nbsp;</a>They shall call the people unto the mountain; there they shall offer sacrifices of righteousness: for
they shall suck
<span class="add">of</span> the abundance of the seas, and
<span class="add">of</span> treasures hid in the sand.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C33V20">&nbsp;</a>And of Gad he said, Blessed
<span class="add">be</span> he that enlargeth Gad: he dwelleth as a lion, and teareth the arm with the crown of the head.
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C33V21">&nbsp;</a>And he provided the first part for himself, because there,
<span class="add">in</span> a portion of the lawgiver,
<span class="add">was he</span> seated; and he came with the heads of the people, he executed the justice of the LORD, and his judgments
with Israel.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C33V22">&nbsp;</a>And of Dan he said, Dan
<span class="add">is</span> a lion’s whelp: he shall leap from Bashan.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C33V23">&nbsp;</a>And of Naphtali he said, O Naphtali, satisfied with favour, and full with the blessing of the LORD: possess
thou the west and the south.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C33V24">&nbsp;</a>And of Asher he said,
<span class="add">Let</span> Asher
<span class="add">be</span> blessed with children; let him be acceptable to his brethren, and let him dip his foot in oil.
 <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C33V25">&nbsp;</a>Thy shoes
<span class="add">shall be</span> iron and brass; and as thy days,
<span class="add">so shall</span> thy strength
<span class="add">be.</span></div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C33V26">&nbsp;</a><span class="add">There is</span> none like unto the God of Jeshurun,
<span class="add">who</span> rideth upon the heaven in thy help, and in his excellency on the sky.
 <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C33V27">&nbsp;</a>The eternal God
<span class="add">is thy</span> refuge, and underneath
<span class="add">are</span> the everlasting arms: and he shall thrust out the enemy from before thee; and shall say, Destroy
<span class="add">them.
</span> <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C33V28">&nbsp;</a>Israel then shall dwell in safety alone: the fountain of Jacob
<span class="add">shall be</span> upon a land of corn and wine; also his heavens shall drop down dew.
 <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C33V29">&nbsp;</a>Happy
<span class="add">art</span> thou, O Israel: who
<span class="add">is</span> like unto thee, O people saved by the LORD, the shield of thy help, and who
<span class="add">is</span> the sword of thy excellency! and thine enemies shall be found liars unto thee; and thou shalt tread
upon their high places.
