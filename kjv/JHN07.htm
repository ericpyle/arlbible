 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C7V1">&nbsp;</a>After these things Jesus walked in Galilee: for he would not walk in Jewry, because the Jews sought to
kill him.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C7V2">&nbsp;</a>Now the Jews’ feast of tabernacles was at hand.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C7V3">&nbsp;</a>His brethren therefore said unto him, Depart hence, and go into Judaea, that thy disciples also may see
the works that thou doest.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C7V4">&nbsp;</a>For
<span class="add">there is</span> no man
<span class="add">that</span> doeth any thing in secret, and he himself seeketh to be known openly. If thou do these things, shew
thyself to the world.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C7V5">&nbsp;</a>For neither did his brethren believe in him.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C7V6">&nbsp;</a>Then Jesus said unto them,
<span class="wj">My time is not yet come: but your time is alway ready.
</span> <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C7V7">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">The world cannot hate you; but me it hateth, because I testify of it, that the works thereof are evil.
</span> <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C7V8">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Go ye up unto this feast: I go not up yet unto this feast; for my time is not yet full come.
</span> <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C7V9">&nbsp;</a>When he had said these words unto them, he abode
<span class="add">still</span> in Galilee.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C7V10">&nbsp;</a>But when his brethren were gone up, then went he also up unto the feast, not openly, but as it were in
secret.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C7V11">&nbsp;</a>Then the Jews sought him at the feast, and said, Where is he?
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C7V12">&nbsp;</a>And there was much murmuring among the people concerning him: for some said, He is a good man: others
said, Nay; but he deceiveth the people.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C7V13">&nbsp;</a>Howbeit no man spake openly of him for fear of the Jews.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C7V14">&nbsp;</a>Now about the midst of the feast Jesus went up into the temple, and taught.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C7V15">&nbsp;</a>And the Jews marvelled, saying, How knoweth this man letters, having never learned?
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C7V16">&nbsp;</a>Jesus answered them, and said,
<span class="wj">My doctrine is not mine, but his that sent me.
</span> <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C7V17">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">If any man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God, or
whether I speak of myself.
</span> <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C7V18">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">He that speaketh of himself seeketh his own glory: but he that seeketh his glory that sent him, the same
is true, and no unrighteousness is in him.
</span> <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C7V19">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Did not Moses give you the law, and
yet none of you keepeth the law? Why go ye about to kill me?
</span> <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C7V20">&nbsp;</a>The people answered and said, Thou hast a devil: who goeth about to kill thee?
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C7V21">&nbsp;</a>Jesus answered and said unto them,
<span class="wj">I have done one work, and ye all marvel.
</span> <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C7V22">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Moses therefore gave unto you circumcision; (not because it is of Moses, but of the fathers;) and ye
on the sabbath day circumcise a man.
</span> <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C7V23">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">If a man on the sabbath day receive circumcision, that the law of Moses should not be broken; are ye
angry at me, because I have made a man every whit whole on the sabbath day?
</span> <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C7V24">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Judge not according to the appearance, but judge righteous judgment.
</span> <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C7V25">&nbsp;</a>Then said some of them of Jerusalem, Is not this he, whom they seek to kill?
 <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C7V26">&nbsp;</a>But, lo, he speaketh boldly, and they say nothing unto him. Do the rulers know indeed that this is the
very Christ?
 <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C7V27">&nbsp;</a>Howbeit we know this man whence he is: but when Christ cometh, no man knoweth whence he is.
 <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C7V28">&nbsp;</a>Then cried Jesus in the temple as he taught, saying,
<span class="wj">Ye both know me, and ye know whence I am: and I am not come of myself, but he that sent me is true, whom
ye know not.
</span> <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C7V29">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">But I know him: for I am from him, and he hath sent me.
</span> <span class="verse"> 30</span><a name="C7V30">&nbsp;</a>Then they sought to take him: but no man laid hands on him, because his hour was not yet come.
 <span class="verse"> 31</span><a name="C7V31">&nbsp;</a>And many of the people believed on him, and said, When Christ cometh, will he do more miracles than these
which this
<span class="add">man</span> hath done?
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 32</span><a name="C7V32">&nbsp;</a>The Pharisees heard that the people murmured such things concerning him; and the Pharisees and the chief
priests sent officers to take him.
 <span class="verse"> 33</span><a name="C7V33">&nbsp;</a>Then said Jesus unto them,
<span class="wj">Yet a little while am I with you, and
then I go unto him that sent me.
</span> <span class="verse"> 34</span><a name="C7V34">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Ye shall seek me, and shall not find
me: and where I am,
thither ye cannot come.
</span> <span class="verse"> 35</span><a name="C7V35">&nbsp;</a>Then said the Jews among themselves, Whither will he go, that we shall not find him? will he go unto
the dispersed among the Gentiles, and teach the Gentiles?
 <span class="verse"> 36</span><a name="C7V36">&nbsp;</a>What
<span class="add">manner of</span> saying is this that he said,
<span class="wj">Ye shall seek me, and shall not find
me: and where I am,
thither ye cannot come?
</span> <span class="verse"> 37</span><a name="C7V37">&nbsp;</a>In the last day, that great
<span class="add">day</span> of the feast, Jesus stood and cried, saying,
<span class="wj">If any man thirst, let him come unto me, and drink.
</span> <span class="verse"> 38</span><a name="C7V38">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">He that believeth on me, as the scripture hath said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water.
</span> <span class="verse"> 39</span><a name="C7V39">&nbsp;</a>(But this spake he of the Spirit, which they that believe on him should receive: for the Holy Ghost was
not yet
<span class="add">given;</span> because that Jesus was not yet glorified.)
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 40</span><a name="C7V40">&nbsp;</a>Many of the people therefore, when they heard this saying, said, Of a truth this is the Prophet.
 <span class="verse"> 41</span><a name="C7V41">&nbsp;</a>Others said, This is the Christ. But some said, Shall Christ come out of Galilee?
 <span class="verse"> 42</span><a name="C7V42">&nbsp;</a>Hath not the scripture said, That Christ cometh of the seed of David, and out of the town of Bethlehem,
where David was?
 <span class="verse"> 43</span><a name="C7V43">&nbsp;</a>So there was a division among the people because of him.
 <span class="verse"> 44</span><a name="C7V44">&nbsp;</a>And some of them would have taken him; but no man laid hands on him.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 45</span><a name="C7V45">&nbsp;</a>Then came the officers to the chief priests and Pharisees; and they said unto them, Why have ye not brought
him?
 <span class="verse"> 46</span><a name="C7V46">&nbsp;</a>The officers answered, Never man spake like this man.
 <span class="verse"> 47</span><a name="C7V47">&nbsp;</a>Then answered them the Pharisees, Are ye also deceived?
 <span class="verse"> 48</span><a name="C7V48">&nbsp;</a>Have any of the rulers or of the Pharisees believed on him?
 <span class="verse"> 49</span><a name="C7V49">&nbsp;</a>But this people who knoweth not the law are cursed.
 <span class="verse"> 50</span><a name="C7V50">&nbsp;</a>Nicodemus saith unto them, (he that came to Jesus by night, being one of them,)
 <span class="verse"> 51</span><a name="C7V51">&nbsp;</a>Doth our law judge
<span class="add">any</span> man, before it hear him, and know what he doeth?
 <span class="verse"> 52</span><a name="C7V52">&nbsp;</a>They answered and said unto him, Art thou also of Galilee? Search, and look: for out of Galilee ariseth
no prophet.
 <span class="verse"> 53</span><a name="C7V53">&nbsp;</a>And every man went unto his own house.
