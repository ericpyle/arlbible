 <span class="verse" id="V1">1&nbsp;</span>Be not thou envious against evil men, neither desire to be with them.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span>For their heart studieth destruction, and their lips talk of mischief.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>Through wisdom is an house builded; and by understanding it is established:  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>And by knowledge shall the chambers be filled with all precious and pleasant riches.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>A wise man <span class='add'>is</span> strong; yea, a man of knowledge increaseth strength.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>For by wise counsel thou shalt make thy war: and in multitude of counsellors <span class='add'>there is</span> safety.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>Wisdom <span class='add'>is</span> too high for a fool: he openeth not his mouth in the gate.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>He that deviseth to do evil shall be called a mischievous person.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>The thought of foolishness <span class='add'>is</span> sin: and the scorner <span class='add'>is</span> an abomination to men.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span> <span class='add'>If</span> thou faint in the day of adversity, thy strength <span class='add'>is</span> small.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>If thou forbear to deliver <span class='add'>them that are</span> drawn unto death, and <span class='add'>those that are</span> ready to be slain;  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>If thou sayest, Behold, we knew it not; doth not he that pondereth the heart consider <span class='add'>it?</span> and he that keepeth thy soul, doth <span class='add'>not</span> he know <span class='add'>it?</span> and shall <span class='add'>not</span> he render to <span class='add'>every</span> man according to his works?  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>My son, eat thou honey, because <span class='add'>it is</span> good; and the honeycomb, <span class='add'>which is</span> sweet to thy taste:  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>So <span class='add'>shall</span> the knowledge of wisdom <span class='add'>be</span> unto thy soul: when thou hast found <span class='add'>it</span>, then there shall be a reward, and thy expectation shall not be cut off.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>Lay not wait, O wicked <span class='add'>man</span>, against the dwelling of the righteous; spoil not his resting place:  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>For a just <span class='add'>man</span> falleth seven times, and riseth up again: but the wicked shall fall into mischief.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>Rejoice not when thine enemy falleth, and let not thine heart be glad when he stumbleth:  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>Lest the LORD see <span class='add'>it</span>, and it displease him, and he turn away his wrath from him.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>Fret not thyself because of evil <span class='add'>men</span>, neither be thou envious at the wicked;  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>For there shall be no reward to the evil <span class='add'>man;</span> the candle of the wicked shall be put out.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>My son, fear thou the LORD and the king: <span class='add'>and</span> meddle not with them that are given to change:  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>For their calamity shall rise suddenly; and who knoweth the ruin of them both?  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>These <span class='add'>things</span> also <span class='add'>belong</span> to the wise. <span class='add'>It is</span> not good to have respect of persons in judgment.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>He that saith unto the wicked, Thou <span class='add'>art</span> righteous; him shall the people curse, nations shall abhor him:  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>But to them that rebuke <span class='add'>him</span> shall be delight, and a good blessing shall come upon them.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span> <span class='add'>Every man</span> shall kiss <span class='add'>his</span> lips that giveth a right answer.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>Prepare thy work without, and make it fit for thyself in the field; and afterwards build thine house.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&nbsp;</span>Be not a witness against thy neighbour without cause; and deceive <span class='add'>not</span> with thy lips.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&nbsp;</span>Say not, I will do so to him as he hath done to me: I will render to the man according to his work.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&nbsp;</span>I went by the field of the slothful, and by the vineyard of the man void of understanding;  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&nbsp;</span>And, lo, it was all grown over with thorns, <span class='add'>and</span> nettles had covered the face thereof, and the stone wall thereof was broken down.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&nbsp;</span>Then I saw, <span class='add'>and</span> considered <span class='add'>it</span> well: I looked upon <span class='add'>it, and</span> received instruction.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&nbsp;</span> <span class='add'>Yet</span> a little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to sleep:  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&nbsp;</span>So shall thy poverty come as one that travelleth; and thy want as an armed man. </div><ul class='tnav'>
