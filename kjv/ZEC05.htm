 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C5V1">&nbsp;</a>Then I turned, and lifted up mine eyes, and looked, and behold a flying roll.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C5V2">&nbsp;</a>And he said unto me, What seest thou? And I answered, I see a flying roll; the length thereof
<span class="add">is</span> twenty cubits, and the breadth thereof ten cubits.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C5V3">&nbsp;</a>Then said he unto me, This
<span class="add">is</span> the curse that goeth forth over the face of the whole earth: for every one that stealeth shall be cut
off
<span class="add">as</span> on this side according to it; and every one that sweareth shall be cut off
<span class="add">as</span> on that side according to it.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C5V4">&nbsp;</a>I will bring it forth, saith the LORD of hosts, and it shall enter into the house of the thief, and into
the house of him that sweareth falsely by my name: and it shall remain in the midst of his house, and
shall consume it with the timber thereof and the stones thereof.

<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C5V5">&nbsp;</a>Then the angel that talked with me went forth, and said unto me, Lift up now thine eyes, and see what
<span class="add">is</span> this that goeth forth.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C5V6">&nbsp;</a>And I said, What
<span class="add">is</span> it? And he said, This
<span class="add">is</span> an ephah that goeth forth. He said moreover, This
<span class="add">is</span> their resemblance through all the earth.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C5V7">&nbsp;</a>And, behold, there was lifted up a talent of lead: and this
<span class="add">is</span> a woman that sitteth in the midst of the ephah.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C5V8">&nbsp;</a>And he said, This
<span class="add">is</span> wickedness. And he cast it into the midst of the ephah; and he cast the weight of lead upon the mouth
thereof.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C5V9">&nbsp;</a>Then lifted I up mine eyes, and looked, and, behold, there came out two women, and the wind
<span class="add">was</span> in their wings; for they had wings like the wings of a stork: and they lifted up the ephah between the
earth and the heaven.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C5V10">&nbsp;</a>Then said I to the angel that talked with me, Whither do these bear the ephah?
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C5V11">&nbsp;</a>And he said unto me, To build it an house in the land of Shinar: and it shall be established, and set
there upon her own base.
