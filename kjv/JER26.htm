 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C26V1">&nbsp;</a>In the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah came this word from the LORD,
saying,
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C26V2">&nbsp;</a>Thus saith the LORD; Stand in the court of the LORD’S house, and speak unto all the cities of Judah,
which come to worship in the LORD’S house, all the words that I command thee to speak unto them; diminish
not a word:
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C26V3">&nbsp;</a>If so be they will hearken, and turn every man from his evil way, that I may repent me of the evil, which
I purpose to do unto them because of the evil of their doings.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C26V4">&nbsp;</a>And thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the LORD; If ye will not hearken to me, to walk in my law, which
I have set before you,
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C26V5">&nbsp;</a>To hearken to the words of my servants the prophets, whom I sent unto you, both rising up early, and
sending
<span class="add">them,</span> but ye have not hearkened;
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C26V6">&nbsp;</a>Then will I make this house like Shiloh, and will make this city a curse to all the nations of the earth.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C26V7">&nbsp;</a>So the priests and the prophets and all the people heard Jeremiah speaking these words in the house of
the LORD.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C26V8">&nbsp;</a>Now it came to pass, when Jeremiah had made an end of speaking all that the LORD had commanded
<span class="add">him</span> to speak unto all the people, that the priests and the prophets and all the people took him, saying,
Thou shalt surely die.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C26V9">&nbsp;</a>Why hast thou prophesied in the name of the LORD, saying, This house shall be like Shiloh, and this city
shall be desolate without an inhabitant? And all the people were gathered against Jeremiah in the house
of the LORD.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C26V10">&nbsp;</a>When the princes of Judah heard these things, then they came up from the king’s house unto the house
of the LORD, and sat down in the entry of the new gate of the LORD’S
<span class="add">house.
</span> <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C26V11">&nbsp;</a>Then spake the priests and the prophets unto the princes and to all the people, saying, This man
<span class="add">is</span> worthy to die; for he hath prophesied against this city, as ye have heard with your ears.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C26V12">&nbsp;</a>Then spake Jeremiah unto all the princes and to all the people, saying, The LORD sent me to prophesy
against this house and against this city all the words that ye have heard.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C26V13">&nbsp;</a>Therefore now amend your ways and your doings, and obey the voice of the LORD your God; and the LORD
will repent him of the evil that he hath pronounced against you.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C26V14">&nbsp;</a>As for me, behold, I
<span class="add">am</span> in your hand: do with me as seemeth good and meet unto you.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C26V15">&nbsp;</a>But know ye for certain, that if ye put me to death, ye shall surely bring innocent blood upon yourselves,
and upon this city, and upon the inhabitants thereof: for of a truth the LORD hath sent me unto you to
speak all these words in your ears.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C26V16">&nbsp;</a>Then said the princes and all the people unto the priests and to the prophets; This man
<span class="add">is</span> not worthy to die: for he hath spoken to us in the name of the LORD our God.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C26V17">&nbsp;</a>Then rose up certain of the elders of the land, and spake to all the assembly of the people, saying,
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C26V18">&nbsp;</a>Micah the Morasthite prophesied in the days of Hezekiah king of Judah, and spake to all the people of
Judah, saying, Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Zion shall be plowed
<span class="add">like</span> a field, and Jerusalem shall become heaps, and the mountain of the house as the high places of a forest.
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C26V19">&nbsp;</a>Did Hezekiah king of Judah and all Judah put him at all to death? did he not fear the LORD, and besought
the LORD, and the LORD repented him of the evil which he had pronounced against them? Thus might we procure
great evil against our souls.
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C26V20">&nbsp;</a>And there was also a man that prophesied in the name of the LORD, Urijah the son of Shemaiah of Kirjath-jearim,
who prophesied against this city and against this land according to all the words of Jeremiah:
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C26V21">&nbsp;</a>And when Jehoiakim the king, with all his mighty men, and all the princes, heard his words, the king
sought to put him to death: but when Urijah heard it, he was afraid, and fled, and went into Egypt;
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C26V22">&nbsp;</a>And Jehoiakim the king sent men into Egypt,
<span class="add">namely,</span> Elnathan the son of Achbor, and
<span class="add">certain</span> men with him into Egypt.
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C26V23">&nbsp;</a>And they fetched forth Urijah out of Egypt, and brought him unto Jehoiakim the king; who slew him with
the sword, and cast his dead body into the graves of the common people.
 <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C26V24">&nbsp;</a>Nevertheless the hand of Ahikam the son of Shaphan was with Jeremiah, that they should not give him into
the hand of the people to put him to death.
