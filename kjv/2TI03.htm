 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C3V1">&nbsp;</a>This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C3V2">&nbsp;</a>For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents,
unthankful, unholy,
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C3V3">&nbsp;</a>Without natural affection, trucebreakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that
are good,
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C3V4">&nbsp;</a>Traitors, heady, highminded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God;
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C3V5">&nbsp;</a>Having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof: from such turn away.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C3V6">&nbsp;</a>For of this sort are they which creep into houses, and lead captive silly women laden with sins, led
away with divers lusts,
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C3V7">&nbsp;</a>Ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C3V8">&nbsp;</a>Now as Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses, so do these also resist the truth: men of corrupt minds, reprobate
concerning the faith.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C3V9">&nbsp;</a>But they shall proceed no further: for their folly shall be manifest unto all
<span class="add">men,</span> as theirs also was.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C3V10">&nbsp;</a>But thou hast fully known my doctrine, manner of life, purpose, faith, longsuffering, charity, patience,
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C3V11">&nbsp;</a>Persecutions, afflictions, which came unto me at Antioch, at Iconium, at Lystra; what persecutions I
endured: but out of
<span class="add">them</span> all the Lord delivered me.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C3V12">&nbsp;</a>Yea, and all that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C3V13">&nbsp;</a>But evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse, deceiving, and being deceived.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C3V14">&nbsp;</a>But continue thou in the things which thou hast learned and hast been assured of, knowing of whom thou
hast learned
<span class="add">them;
</span> <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C3V15">&nbsp;</a>And that from a child thou hast known the holy scriptures, which are able to make thee wise unto salvation
through faith which is in Christ Jesus.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C3V16">&nbsp;</a>All scripture
<span class="add">is</span> given by inspiration of God, and
<span class="add">is
</span> profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness:
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C3V17">&nbsp;</a>That the man of God may be perfect, throughly furnished unto all good works.
