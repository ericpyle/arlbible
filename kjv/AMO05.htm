the day of the LORD <span class='add'>is</span> darkness, and not light.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>As if a man did flee from a lion, and a bear met him; or went into the house, and leaned his hand on the wall, and a serpent bit him.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span> <span class='add'>Shall</span> not the day of the LORD <span class='add'>be</span> darkness, and not light?
