 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C5V1">&nbsp;</a>Hear ye this word which I take up against you,
<span class="add">even</span> a lamentation, O house of Israel.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C5V2">&nbsp;</a>The virgin of Israel is fallen; she shall no more rise: she is forsaken upon her land;
<span class="add">there is</span> none to raise her up.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C5V3">&nbsp;</a>For thus saith the Lord GOD; The city that went out
<span class="add">by</span> a thousand shall leave an hundred, and that which went forth
<span class="add">by</span> an hundred shall leave ten, to the house of Israel.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C5V4">&nbsp;</a>For thus saith the LORD unto the house of Israel, Seek ye me, and ye shall live:
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C5V5">&nbsp;</a>But seek not Bethel, nor enter into Gilgal, and pass not to Beer-sheba: for Gilgal shall surely go into
captivity, and Bethel shall come to nought.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C5V6">&nbsp;</a>Seek the LORD, and ye shall live; lest he break out like fire in the house of Joseph, and devour
<span class="add">it,</span> and
<span class="add">there be</span> none to quench
<span class="add">it</span> in Bethel.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C5V7">&nbsp;</a>Ye who turn judgment to wormwood, and leave off righteousness in the earth,
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C5V8">&nbsp;</a><span class="add">Seek him</span> that maketh the seven stars and Orion, and turneth the shadow of death into the morning, and maketh
the day dark with night: that calleth for the waters of the sea, and poureth them out upon the face of
the earth: The LORD
<span class="add">is</span> his name:
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C5V9">&nbsp;</a>That strengtheneth the spoiled against the strong, so that the spoiled shall come against the fortress.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C5V10">&nbsp;</a>They hate him that rebuketh in the gate, and they abhor him that speaketh uprightly.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C5V11">&nbsp;</a>Forasmuch therefore as your treading
<span class="add">is</span> upon the poor, and ye take from him burdens of wheat: ye have built houses of hewn stone, but ye shall
not dwell in them; ye have planted pleasant vineyards, but ye shall not drink wine of them.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C5V12">&nbsp;</a>For I know your manifold transgressions and your mighty sins: they afflict the just, they take a bribe,
and they turn aside the poor in the gate
<span class="add">from their right.
</span> <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C5V13">&nbsp;</a>Therefore the prudent shall keep silence in that time; for it
<span class="add">is</span> an evil time.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C5V14">&nbsp;</a>Seek good, and not evil, that ye may live: and so the LORD, the God of hosts, shall be with you, as ye
have spoken.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C5V15">&nbsp;</a>Hate the evil, and love the good, and establish judgment in the gate: it may be that the LORD God of
hosts will be gracious unto the remnant of Joseph.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C5V16">&nbsp;</a>Therefore the LORD, the God of hosts, the Lord, saith thus; Wailing
<span class="add">shall be</span> in all streets; and they shall say in all the highways, Alas! alas! and they shall call the husbandman
to mourning, and such as are skilful of lamentation to wailing.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C5V17">&nbsp;</a>And in all vineyards
<span class="add">shall be</span> wailing: for I will pass through thee, saith the LORD.
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C5V18">&nbsp;</a>Woe unto you that desire the day of the LORD! to what end
<span class="add">is</span> it for you? the day of the LORD
<span class="add">is</span> darkness, and not light.
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C5V19">&nbsp;</a>As if a man did flee from a lion, and a bear met him; or went into the house, and leaned his hand on
the wall, and a serpent bit him.
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C5V20">&nbsp;</a><span class="add">Shall</span> not the day of the LORD
<span class="add">be</span> darkness, and not light? even very dark, and no brightness in it?
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C5V21">&nbsp;</a>I hate, I despise your feast days, and I will not smell in your solemn assemblies.
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C5V22">&nbsp;</a>Though ye offer me burnt offerings and your meat offerings, I will not accept
<span class="add">them:</span> neither will I regard the peace offerings of your fat beasts.
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C5V23">&nbsp;</a>Take thou away from me the noise of thy songs; for I will not hear the melody of thy viols.
 <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C5V24">&nbsp;</a>But let judgment run down as waters, and righteousness as a mighty stream.
 <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C5V25">&nbsp;</a>Have ye offered unto me sacrifices and offerings in the wilderness forty years, O house of Israel?
 <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C5V26">&nbsp;</a>But ye have borne the tabernacle of your Moloch and Chiun your images, the star of your god, which ye
made to yourselves.
 <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C5V27">&nbsp;</a>Therefore will I cause you to go into captivity beyond Damascus, saith the LORD, whose name
<span class="add">is</span> The God of hosts.
