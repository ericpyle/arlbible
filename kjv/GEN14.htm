 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C14V1">&nbsp;</a>And it came to pass in the days of Amraphel king of Shinar, Arioch king of Ellasar, Chedorlaomer king
of Elam, and Tidal king of nations;
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C14V2">&nbsp;</a><span class="add">That these</span> made war with Bera king of Sodom, and with Birsha king of Gomorrah, Shinab king of Admah, and Shemeber
king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela, which is Zoar.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C14V3">&nbsp;</a>All these were joined together in the vale of Siddim, which is the salt sea.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C14V4">&nbsp;</a>Twelve years they served Chedorlaomer, and in the thirteenth year they rebelled.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C14V5">&nbsp;</a>And in the fourteenth year came Chedorlaomer, and the kings that
<span class="add">were</span> with him, and smote the Rephaims in Ashteroth Karnaim, and the Zuzims in Ham, and the Emims in Shaveh
Kiriathaim,
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C14V6">&nbsp;</a>And the Horites in their mount Seir, unto El-paran, which
<span class="add">is</span> by the wilderness.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C14V7">&nbsp;</a>And they returned, and came to En-mishpat, which
<span class="add">is</span> Kadesh, and smote all the country of the Amalekites, and also the Amorites that dwelt in Hazezon-tamar.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C14V8">&nbsp;</a>And there went out the king of Sodom, and the king of Gomorrah, and the king of Admah, and the king of
Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (the same
<span class="add">is</span> Zoar;) and they joined battle with them in the vale of Siddim;
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C14V9">&nbsp;</a>With Chedorlaomer the king of Elam, and with Tidal king of nations, and Amraphel king of Shinar, and
Arioch king of Ellasar; four kings with five.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C14V10">&nbsp;</a>And the vale of Siddim
<span class="add">was full of</span> slimepits; and the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled, and fell there; and they that remained fled to
the mountain.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C14V11">&nbsp;</a>And they took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah, and all their victuals, and went their way.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C14V12">&nbsp;</a>And they took Lot, Abram’s brother’s son, who dwelt in Sodom, and his goods, and departed.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C14V13">&nbsp;</a>And there came one that had escaped, and told Abram the Hebrew; for he dwelt in the plain of Mamre the
Amorite, brother of Eshcol, and brother of Aner: and these
<span class="add">were</span> confederate with Abram.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C14V14">&nbsp;</a>And when Abram heard that his brother was taken captive, he armed his trained
<span class="add">servants,</span> born in his own house, three hundred and eighteen, and pursued
<span class="add">them</span> unto Dan.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C14V15">&nbsp;</a>And he divided himself against them, he and his servants, by night, and smote them, and pursued them
unto Hobah, which
<span class="add">is</span> on the left hand of Damascus.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C14V16">&nbsp;</a>And he brought back all the goods, and also brought again his brother Lot, and his goods, and the women
also, and the people.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C14V17">&nbsp;</a>And the king of Sodom went out to meet him after his return from the slaughter of Chedorlaomer, and of
the kings that
<span class="add">were</span> with him, at the valley of Shaveh, which
<span class="add">is</span> the king’s dale.
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C14V18">&nbsp;</a>And Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth bread and wine: and he
<span class="add">was</span> the priest of the most high God.
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C14V19">&nbsp;</a>And he blessed him, and said, Blessed
<span class="add">be</span> Abram of the most high God, possessor of heaven and earth:
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C14V20">&nbsp;</a>And blessed be the most high God, which hath delivered thine enemies into thy hand. And he gave him tithes
of all.
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C14V21">&nbsp;</a>And the king of Sodom said unto Abram, Give me the persons, and take the goods to thyself.
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C14V22">&nbsp;</a>And Abram said to the king of Sodom, I have lift up mine hand unto the LORD, the most high God, the possessor
of heaven and earth,
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C14V23">&nbsp;</a>That I will not
<span class="add">take</span> from a thread even to a shoelatchet, and that I will not take any thing that
<span class="add">is</span> thine, lest thou shouldest say, I have made Abram rich:
 <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C14V24">&nbsp;</a>Save only that which the young men have eaten, and the portion of the men which went with me, Aner, Eshcol,
and Mamre; let them take their portion.
