<div class="chapterlabel"> 9</div><div class="p">
 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C9V1">&nbsp;</a>Oh that my head were waters, and mine eyes a fountain of tears, that I might weep day and night for the
slain of the daughter of my people!
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C9V2">&nbsp;</a>Oh that I had in the wilderness a lodging place of wayfaring men; that I might leave my people, and go
from them! for they
<span class="add">be</span> all adulterers, an assembly of treacherous men.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C9V3">&nbsp;</a>And they bend their tongues
<span class="add">like</span> their bow
<span class="add">for</span> lies: but they are not valiant for the truth upon the earth; for they proceed from evil to evil, and
they know not me, saith the LORD.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C9V4">&nbsp;</a>Take ye heed every one of his neighbour, and trust ye not in any brother: for every brother will utterly
supplant, and every neighbour will walk with slanders.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C9V5">&nbsp;</a>And they will deceive every one his neighbour, and will not speak the truth: they have taught their tongue
to speak lies,
<span class="add">and</span> weary themselves to commit iniquity.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C9V6">&nbsp;</a>Thine habitation
<span class="add">is</span> in the midst of deceit; through deceit they refuse to know me, saith the LORD.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C9V7">&nbsp;</a>Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts, Behold, I will melt them, and try them; for how shall I do for
the daughter of my people?
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C9V8">&nbsp;</a>Their tongue
<span class="add">is as</span> an arrow shot out; it speaketh deceit:
<span class="add">one</span> speaketh peaceably to his neighbour with his mouth, but in heart he layeth his wait.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C9V9">&nbsp;</a>Shall I not visit them for these
<span class="add">things?</span> saith the LORD: shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this?
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C9V10">&nbsp;</a>For the mountains will I take up a weeping and wailing, and for the habitations of the wilderness a lamentation,
because they are burned up, so that none can pass through
<span class="add">them;</span> neither can
<span class="add">men</span> hear the voice of the cattle; both the fowl of the heavens and the beast are fled; they are gone.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C9V11">&nbsp;</a>And I will make Jerusalem heaps,
<span class="add">and</span> a den of dragons; and I will make the cities of Judah desolate, without an inhabitant.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C9V12">&nbsp;</a>Who
<span class="add">is</span> the wise man, that may understand this? and
<span class="add">who is he</span> to whom the mouth of the LORD hath spoken, that he may declare it, for what the land perisheth
<span class="add">and</span> is burned up like a wilderness, that none passeth through?
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C9V13">&nbsp;</a>And the LORD saith, Because they have forsaken my law which I set before them, and have not obeyed my
voice, neither walked therein;
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C9V14">&nbsp;</a>But have walked after the imagination of their own heart, and after Baalim, which their fathers taught
them:
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C9V15">&nbsp;</a>Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will feed them,
<span class="add">even</span> this people, with wormwood, and give them water of gall to drink.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C9V16">&nbsp;</a>I will scatter them also among the heathen, whom neither they nor their fathers have known: and I will
send a sword after them, till I have consumed them.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C9V17">&nbsp;</a>Thus saith the LORD of hosts, Consider ye, and call for the mourning women, that they may come; and send
for cunning
<span class="add">women,</span> that they may come:
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C9V18">&nbsp;</a>And let them make haste, and take up a wailing for us, that our eyes may run down with tears, and our
eyelids gush out with waters.
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C9V19">&nbsp;</a>For a voice of wailing is heard out of Zion, How are we spoiled! we are greatly confounded, because we
have forsaken the land, because our dwellings have cast
<span class="add">us</span> out.
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C9V20">&nbsp;</a>Yet hear the word of the LORD, O ye women, and let your ear receive the word of his mouth, and teach
your daughters wailing, and every one her neighbour lamentation.
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C9V21">&nbsp;</a>For death is come up into our windows,
<span class="add">and</span> is entered into our palaces, to cut off the children from without,
<span class="add">and</span> the young men from the streets.
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C9V22">&nbsp;</a>Speak, Thus saith the LORD, Even the carcases of men shall fall as dung upon the open field, and as the
handful after the harvestman, and none shall gather
<span class="add">them.</span></div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C9V23">&nbsp;</a>Thus saith the LORD, Let not the wise
<span class="add">man</span> glory in his wisdom, neither let the mighty
<span class="add">man</span> glory in his might, let not the rich
<span class="add">man</span> glory in his riches:
 <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C9V24">&nbsp;</a>But let him that glorieth glory in this, that he understandeth and knoweth me, that I
<span class="add">am</span> the LORD which exercise lovingkindness, judgment, and righteousness, in the earth: for in these
<span class="add">things</span> I delight, saith the LORD.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C9V25">&nbsp;</a>Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will punish all
<span class="add">them which are</span> circumcised with the uncircumcised;
 <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C9V26">&nbsp;</a>Egypt, and Judah, and Edom, and the children of Ammon, and Moab, and all
<span class="add">that are</span> in the utmost corners, that dwell in the wilderness: for all
<span class="add">these</span> nations
<span class="add">are</span> uncircumcised, and all the house of Israel
<span class="add">are</span> uncircumcised in the heart.
