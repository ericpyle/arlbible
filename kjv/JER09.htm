 <span class="verse" id="V1">1&nbsp;</span>Oh that my head were waters, and mine eyes a fountain of tears, that I might weep day and night for the slain of the daughter of my people!  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span>Oh that I had in the wilderness a lodging place of wayfaring men; that I might leave my people, and go from them! for they <span class='add'>be</span> all adulterers, an assembly of treacherous men.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>And they bend their tongues <span class='add'>like</span> their bow <span class='add'>for</span> lies: but they are not valiant for the truth upon the earth; for they proceed from evil to evil, and they know not me, saith the LORD.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>Take ye heed every one of his neighbour, and trust ye not in any brother: for every brother will utterly supplant, and every neighbour will walk with slanders.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>And they will deceive every one his neighbour, and will not speak the truth: they have taught their tongue to speak lies, <span class='add'>and</span> weary themselves to commit iniquity.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>Thine habitation <span class='add'>is</span> in the midst of deceit; through deceit they refuse to know me, saith the LORD.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts, Behold, I will melt them, and try them; for how shall I do for the daughter of my people?  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>Their tongue <span class='add'>is as</span> an arrow shot out; it speaketh deceit: <span class='add'>one</span> speaketh peaceably to his neighbour with his mouth, but in heart he layeth his wait. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>Shall I not visit them for these <span class='add'>things?</span> saith the LORD: shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this?  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>For the mountains will I take up a weeping and wailing, and for the habitations of the wilderness a lamentation, because they are burned up, so that none can pass through <span class='add'>them;</span> neither can <span class='add'>men</span> hear the voice of the cattle; both the fowl of the heavens and the beast are fled; they are gone.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>And I will make Jerusalem heaps, <span class='add'>and</span> a den of dragons; and I will make the cities of Judah desolate, without an inhabitant. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>Who <span class='add'>is</span> the wise man, that may understand this? and <span class='add'>who is he</span> to whom the mouth of the LORD hath spoken, that he may declare it, for what the land perisheth <span class='add'>and</span> is burned up like a wilderness, that none passeth through?  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>And the LORD saith, Because they have forsaken my law which I set before them, and have not obeyed my voice, neither walked therein;  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>But have walked after the imagination of their own heart, and after Baalim, which their fathers taught them:  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will feed them, <span class='add'>even</span> this people, with wormwood, and give them water of gall to drink.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>I will scatter them also among the heathen, whom neither they nor their fathers have known: and I will send a sword after them, till I have consumed them. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>Thus saith the LORD of hosts, Consider ye, and call for the mourning women, that they may come; and send for cunning <span class='add'>women</span>, that they may come:  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>And let them make haste, and take up a wailing for us, that our eyes may run down with tears, and our eyelids gush out with waters.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>For a voice of wailing is heard out of Zion, How are we spoiled! we are greatly confounded, because we have forsaken the land, because our dwellings have cast <span class='add'>us</span> out.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>Yet hear the word of the LORD, O ye women, and let your ear receive the word of his mouth, and teach your daughters wailing, and every one her neighbour lamentation.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>For death is come up into our windows, <span class='add'>and</span> is entered into our palaces, to cut off the children from without, <span class='add'>and</span> the young men from the streets.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>Speak, Thus saith the LORD, Even the carcases of men shall fall as dung upon the open field, and as the handful after the harvestman, and none shall gather <span class='add'>them</span>. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>Thus saith the LORD, Let not the wise <span class='add'>man</span> glory in his wisdom, neither let the mighty <span class='add'>man</span> glory in his might, let not the rich <span class='add'>man</span> glory in his riches:  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>But let him that glorieth glory in this, that he understandeth and knoweth me, that I <span class='add'>am</span> the LORD which exercise lovingkindness, judgment, and righteousness, in the earth: for in these <span class='add'>things</span> I delight, saith the LORD. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will punish all <span class='add'>them which are</span> circumcised with the uncircumcised;  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>Egypt, and Judah, and Edom, and the children of Ammon, and Moab, and all <span class='add'>that are</span> in the utmost corners, that dwell in the wilderness: for all <span class='add'>these</span> nations <span class='add'>are</span> uncircumcised, and all the house of Israel <span class='add'>are</span> uncircumcised in the heart. </div><ul class='tnav'>
