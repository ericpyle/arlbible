 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C23V1">&nbsp;</a>Then spake Jesus to the multitude, and to his disciples,
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C23V2">&nbsp;</a>Saying,
<span class="wj">The scribes and the Pharisees sit in Moses’ seat:
</span> <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C23V3">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">All therefore whatsoever they bid you observe,
that observe and do; but do not ye after their works: for they say, and do not.
</span> <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C23V4">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">For they bind heavy burdens and grievous to be borne, and lay
them on men’s shoulders; but they
themselves will not move them with one of their fingers.
</span> <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C23V5">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">But all their works they do for to be seen of men: they make broad their phylacteries, and enlarge the
borders of their garments,
</span> <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C23V6">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And love the uppermost rooms at feasts, and the chief seats in the synagogues,
</span> <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C23V7">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And greetings in the markets, and to be called of men, Rabbi, Rabbi.
</span> <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C23V8">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">But be not ye called Rabbi: for one is your Master,
even Christ; and all ye are brethren.
</span> <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C23V9">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And call no
man your father upon the earth: for one is your Father, which is in heaven.
</span> <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C23V10">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Neither be ye called masters: for one is your Master,
even Christ.
</span> <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C23V11">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">But he that is greatest among you shall be your servant.
</span> <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C23V12">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And whosoever shall exalt himself shall be abased; and he that shall humble himself shall be exalted.</span></div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C23V13">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">But woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye shut up the kingdom of heaven against men:
for ye neither go in
yourselves, neither suffer ye them that are entering to go in.
</span> <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C23V14">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye devour widows’ houses, and for a pretence make
long prayer: therefore ye shall receive the greater damnation.
</span> <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C23V15">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye compass sea and land to make one proselyte, and
when he is made, ye make him twofold more the child of hell than yourselves.
</span> <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C23V16">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Woe unto you,
ye blind guides, which say, Whosoever shall swear by the temple, it is nothing; but whosoever shall swear
by the gold of the temple, he is a debtor!
</span> <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C23V17">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Ye fools and blind: for whether is greater, the gold, or the temple that sanctifieth the gold?
</span> <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C23V18">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And, Whosoever shall swear by the altar, it is nothing; but whosoever sweareth by the gift that is upon
it, he is guilty.
</span> <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C23V19">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Ye fools and blind: for whether
is greater, the gift, or the altar that sanctifieth the gift?
</span> <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C23V20">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Whoso therefore shall swear by the altar, sweareth by it, and by all things thereon.
</span> <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C23V21">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And whoso shall swear by the temple, sweareth by it, and by him that dwelleth therein.
</span> <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C23V22">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And he that shall swear by heaven, sweareth by the throne of God, and by him that sitteth thereon.
</span> <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C23V23">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye pay tithe of mint and anise and cummin, and have
omitted the weightier
matters of the law, judgment, mercy, and faith: these ought ye to have done, and not to leave the other undone.
</span> <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C23V24">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Ye blind guides, which strain at a gnat, and swallow a camel.
</span> <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C23V25">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye make clean the outside of the cup and of the
platter, but within they are full of extortion and excess.
</span> <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C23V26">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Thou blind Pharisee, cleanse first that
which is within the cup and platter, that the outside of them may be clean also.
</span> <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C23V27">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye are like unto whited sepulchres, which indeed
appear beautiful outward, but are within full of dead
men’s bones, and of all uncleanness.
</span> <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C23V28">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Even so ye also outwardly appear righteous unto men, but within ye are full of hypocrisy and iniquity.
</span> <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C23V29">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! because ye build the tombs of the prophets, and garnish
the sepulchres of the righteous,
</span> <span class="verse"> 30</span><a name="C23V30">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And say, If we had been in the days of our fathers, we would not have been partakers with them in the
blood of the prophets.
</span> <span class="verse"> 31</span><a name="C23V31">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Wherefore ye be witnesses unto yourselves, that ye are the children of them which killed the prophets.
</span> <span class="verse"> 32</span><a name="C23V32">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Fill ye up then the measure of your fathers.
</span> <span class="verse"> 33</span><a name="C23V33">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Ye serpents,
ye generation of vipers, how can ye escape the damnation of hell?</span></div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 34</span><a name="C23V34">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Wherefore, behold, I send unto you prophets, and wise men, and scribes: and
some of them ye shall kill and crucify; and
some of them shall ye scourge in your synagogues, and persecute
them from city to city:
</span> <span class="verse"> 35</span><a name="C23V35">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">That upon you may come all the righteous blood shed upon the earth, from the blood of righteous Abel
unto the blood of Zacharias son of Barachias, whom ye slew between the temple and the altar.
</span> <span class="verse"> 36</span><a name="C23V36">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Verily I say unto you, All these things shall come upon this generation.
</span> <span class="verse"> 37</span><a name="C23V37">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">O Jerusalem, Jerusalem,
thou that killest the prophets, and stonest them which are sent unto thee, how often would I have gathered
thy children together, even as a hen gathereth her chickens under
her wings, and ye would not!
</span> <span class="verse"> 38</span><a name="C23V38">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Behold, your house is left unto you desolate.
</span> <span class="verse"> 39</span><a name="C23V39">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">For I say unto you, Ye shall not see me henceforth, till ye shall say, Blessed
is he that cometh in the name of the Lord.
