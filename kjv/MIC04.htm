 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C4V1">&nbsp;</a>But in the last days it shall come to pass,
<span class="add">that</span> the mountain of the house of the LORD shall be established in the top of the mountains, and it shall
be exalted above the hills; and people shall flow unto it.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C4V2">&nbsp;</a>And many nations shall come, and say, Come, and let us go up to the mountain of the LORD, and to the
house of the God of Jacob; and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths: for the law
shall go forth of Zion, and the word of the LORD from Jerusalem.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C4V3">&nbsp;</a>And he shall judge among many people, and rebuke strong nations afar off; and they shall beat their swords
into plowshares, and their spears into pruninghooks: nation shall not lift up a sword against nation,
neither shall they learn war any more.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C4V4">&nbsp;</a>But they shall sit every man under his vine and under his fig tree; and none shall make
<span class="add">them</span> afraid: for the mouth of the LORD of hosts hath spoken
<span class="add">it.
</span> <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C4V5">&nbsp;</a>For all people will walk every one in the name of his god, and we will walk in the name of the LORD our
God for ever and ever.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C4V6">&nbsp;</a>In that day, saith the LORD, will I assemble her that halteth, and I will gather her that is driven out,
and her that I have afflicted;
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C4V7">&nbsp;</a>And I will make her that halted a remnant, and her that was cast far off a strong nation: and the LORD
shall reign over them in mount Zion from henceforth, even for ever.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C4V8">&nbsp;</a>And thou, O tower of the flock, the strong hold of the daughter of Zion, unto thee shall it come, even
the first dominion; the kingdom shall come to the daughter of Jerusalem.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C4V9">&nbsp;</a>Now why dost thou cry out aloud?
<span class="add">is there</span> no king in thee? is thy counsellor perished? for pangs have taken thee as a woman in travail.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C4V10">&nbsp;</a>Be in pain, and labour to bring forth, O daughter of Zion, like a woman in travail: for now shalt thou
go forth out of the city, and thou shalt dwell in the field, and thou shalt go
<span class="add">even</span> to Babylon; there shalt thou be delivered; there the LORD shall redeem thee from the hand of thine enemies.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C4V11">&nbsp;</a>Now also many nations are gathered against thee, that say, Let her be defiled, and let our eye look upon
Zion.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C4V12">&nbsp;</a>But they know not the thoughts of the LORD, neither understand they his counsel: for he shall gather
them as the sheaves into the floor.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C4V13">&nbsp;</a>Arise and thresh, O daughter of Zion: for I will make thine horn iron, and I will make thy hoofs brass:
and thou shalt beat in pieces many people: and I will consecrate their gain unto the LORD, and their
substance unto the Lord of the whole earth.
