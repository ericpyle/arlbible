 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C4V1">&nbsp;</a>Furthermore then we beseech you, brethren, and exhort
<span class="add">you
</span> by the Lord Jesus, that as ye have received of us how ye ought to walk and to please God,
<span class="add">so</span> ye would abound more and more.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C4V2">&nbsp;</a>For ye know what commandments we gave you by the Lord Jesus.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C4V3">&nbsp;</a>For this is the will of God,
<span class="add">even</span> your sanctification, that ye should abstain from fornication:
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C4V4">&nbsp;</a>That every one of you should know how to possess his vessel in sanctification and honour;
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C4V5">&nbsp;</a>Not in the lust of concupiscence, even as the Gentiles which know not God:
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C4V6">&nbsp;</a>That no
<span class="add">man</span> go beyond and defraud his brother in
<span class="add">any
</span> matter: because that the Lord
<span class="add">is</span> the avenger of all such, as we also have forewarned you and testified.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C4V7">&nbsp;</a>For God hath not called us unto uncleanness, but unto holiness.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C4V8">&nbsp;</a>He therefore that despiseth, despiseth not man, but God, who hath also given unto us his holy Spirit.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C4V9">&nbsp;</a>But as touching brotherly love ye need not that I write unto you: for ye yourselves are taught of God
to love one another.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C4V10">&nbsp;</a>And indeed ye do it toward all the brethren which are in all Macedonia: but we beseech you, brethren,
that ye increase more and more;
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C4V11">&nbsp;</a>And that ye study to be quiet, and to do your own business, and to work with your own hands, as we commanded
you;
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C4V12">&nbsp;</a>That ye may walk honestly toward them that are without, and
<span class="add">that
</span> ye may have lack of nothing.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C4V13">&nbsp;</a>But I would not have you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning them which are asleep, that ye sorrow not,
even as others which have no hope.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C4V14">&nbsp;</a>For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring
with him.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C4V15">&nbsp;</a>For this we say unto you by the word of the Lord, that we which are alive
<span class="add">and</span> remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C4V16">&nbsp;</a>For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with
the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first:
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C4V17">&nbsp;</a>Then we which are alive
<span class="add">and</span> remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall
we ever be with the Lord.
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C4V18">&nbsp;</a>Wherefore comfort one another with these words.
