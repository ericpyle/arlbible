 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C27V1">&nbsp;</a>Then came the daughters of Zelophehad, the son of Hepher, the son of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son
of Manasseh, of the families of Manasseh the son of Joseph: and these are the names of his daughters;
Mahlah, Noah, and Hoglah, and Milcah, and Tirzah.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C27V2">&nbsp;</a>And they stood before Moses, and before Eleazar the priest, and before the princes and all the congregation,
<span class="add">by</span> the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, saying,
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C27V3">&nbsp;</a>Our father died in the wilderness, and he was not in the company of them that gathered themselves together
against the LORD in the company of Korah; but died in his own sin, and had no sons.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C27V4">&nbsp;</a>Why should the name of our father be done away from among his family, because he hath no son? Give unto
us
<span class="add">therefore</span> a possession among the brethren of our father.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C27V5">&nbsp;</a>And Moses brought their cause before the LORD.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C27V6">&nbsp;</a>And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C27V7">&nbsp;</a>The daughters of Zelophehad speak right: thou shalt surely give them a possession of an inheritance among
their father’s brethren; and thou shalt cause the inheritance of their father to pass unto them.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C27V8">&nbsp;</a>And thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel, saying, If a man die, and have no son, then ye shall
cause his inheritance to pass unto his daughter.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C27V9">&nbsp;</a>And if he have no daughter, then ye shall give his inheritance unto his brethren.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C27V10">&nbsp;</a>And if he have no brethren, then ye shall give his inheritance unto his father’s brethren.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C27V11">&nbsp;</a>And if his father have no brethren, then ye shall give his inheritance unto his kinsman that is next
to him of his family, and he shall possess it: and it shall be unto the children of Israel a statute
of judgment, as the LORD commanded Moses.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C27V12">&nbsp;</a>And the LORD said unto Moses, Get thee up into this mount Abarim, and see the land which I have given
unto the children of Israel.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C27V13">&nbsp;</a>And when thou hast seen it, thou also shalt be gathered unto thy people, as Aaron thy brother was gathered.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C27V14">&nbsp;</a>For ye rebelled against my commandment in the desert of Zin, in the strife of the congregation, to sanctify
me at the water before their eyes: that
<span class="add">is</span> the water of Meribah in Kadesh in the wilderness of Zin.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C27V15">&nbsp;</a>And Moses spake unto the LORD, saying,
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C27V16">&nbsp;</a>Let the LORD, the God of the spirits of all flesh, set a man over the congregation,
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C27V17">&nbsp;</a>Which may go out before them, and which may go in before them, and which may lead them out, and which
may bring them in; that the congregation of the LORD be not as sheep which have no shepherd.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C27V18">&nbsp;</a>And the LORD said unto Moses, Take thee Joshua the son of Nun, a man in whom
<span class="add">is</span> the spirit, and lay thine hand upon him;
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C27V19">&nbsp;</a>And set him before Eleazar the priest, and before all the congregation; and give him a charge in their
sight.
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C27V20">&nbsp;</a>And thou shalt put some of thine honour upon him, that all the congregation of the children of Israel
may be obedient.
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C27V21">&nbsp;</a>And he shall stand before Eleazar the priest, who shall ask
<span class="add">counsel
</span> for him after the judgment of Urim before the LORD: at his word shall they go out, and at his word they
shall come in,
<span class="add">both</span> he, and all the children of Israel with him, even all the congregation.
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C27V22">&nbsp;</a>And Moses did as the LORD commanded him: and he took Joshua, and set him before Eleazar the priest, and
before all the congregation:
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C27V23">&nbsp;</a>And he laid his hands upon him, and gave him a charge, as the LORD commanded by the hand of Moses.
