<div class="mt1">The Wisdom of Jesus the Son of Sirach, or Ecclesiasticus
</div>
<div class="chapterlabel"> 1</div><div class="p"></div>
<div class="s1">A Prologue made by an uncertain Author This Jesus was the son of Sirach, and grandchild to Jesus of the
same name with him: this man therefore lived in the latter times, after the people had been led away
captive, and called home a again, and almost after all the prophets. Now his grandfather Jesus, as he
himself witnesseth, was a man of great diligence and wisdom among the Hebrews, who did not only gather
the grave and short sentences of wise men, that had been before him, but himself also uttered some of
his own, full of much understanding and wisdom. When as therefore the first Jesus died, leaving this
book almost perfected, Sirach his son receiving it after him left it to his own son Jesus, who, having
gotten it into his hands, compiled it all orderly into one volume, and called it Wisdom, intituling it
both by his own name, his father’s name, and his grandfather’s; alluring the hearer by the very name
of Wisdom to have a greater love to the study of this book. It containeth therefore wise sayings, dark
sentences, and parables, and certain particular ancient godly stories of men that pleased God; also his
prayer and song; moreover, what benefits God had vouchsafed his people, and what plagues he had heaped
upon their enemies. This Jesus did imitate Solomon, and was no less famous for wisdom and learning, both
being indeed a man of great learning, and so reputed also.
</div>
<div class="p"></div>
<div class="s1">The Prologue of the Wisdom of Jesus the Son of Sirach. Whereas many and great things have been delivered
unto us by the law and the prophets, and by others that have followed their steps, for the which things
Israel ought to be commended for learning and wisdom; and whereof not only the readers must needs become
skilful themselves, but also they that desire to learn be able to profit them which are without, both
by speaking and writing: my grandfather Jesus, when he had much given himself to the reading of the law,
and the prophets, and other books of our fathers, and had gotten therein good judgment, was drawn on
also himself to write something pertaining to learning and wisdom; to the intent that those which are
desirous to learn, and are addicted to these things, might profit much more in living according to the
law. Wherefore let me intreat you to read it with favour and attention, and to pardon us, wherein we
may seem to come short of some words, which we have laboured to interpret. For the same things uttered
in Hebrew, and translated into another tongue, have not the same force in them: and not only these things,
but the law itself, and the prophets, and the rest of the books, have no small difference, when they
are spoken in their own language. For in the eight and thirtieth year coming into Egypt, when Euergetes
was king, and continuing there some time, I found a book of no small learning: therefore I thought it
most necessary for me to bestow some diligence and travail to interpret it; using great watchfulness
and skill in that space to bring the book to an end, and set it forth for them also, which in a strange
country are willing to learn, being prepared before in manners to live after the law.
