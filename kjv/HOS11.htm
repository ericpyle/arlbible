 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C11V1">&nbsp;</a>When Israel
<span class="add">was</span> a child, then I loved him, and called my son out of Egypt.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C11V2">&nbsp;</a><span class="add">As</span> they called them, so they went from them: they sacrificed unto Baalim, and burned incense to graven
images.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C11V3">&nbsp;</a>I taught Ephraim also to go, taking them by their arms; but they knew not that I healed them.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C11V4">&nbsp;</a>I drew them with cords of a man, with bands of love: and I was to them as they that take off the yoke
on their jaws, and I laid meat unto them.

<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C11V5">&nbsp;</a>He shall not return into the land of Egypt, but the Assyrian shall be his king, because they refused
to return.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C11V6">&nbsp;</a>And the sword shall abide on his cities, and shall consume his branches, and devour
<span class="add">them,</span> because of their own counsels.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C11V7">&nbsp;</a>And my people are bent to backsliding from me: though they called them to the most High, none at all
would exalt
<span class="add">him.
</span> <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C11V8">&nbsp;</a>How shall I give thee up, Ephraim?
<span class="add">how</span> shall I deliver thee, Israel? how shall I make thee as Admah?
<span class="add">how</span> shall I set thee as Zeboim? mine heart is turned within me, my repentings are kindled together.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C11V9">&nbsp;</a>I will not execute the fierceness of mine anger, I will not return to destroy Ephraim: for I
<span class="add">am</span> God, and not man; the Holy One in the midst of thee: and I will not enter into the city.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C11V10">&nbsp;</a>They shall walk after the LORD: he shall roar like a lion: when he shall roar, then the children shall
tremble from the west.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C11V11">&nbsp;</a>They shall tremble as a bird out of Egypt, and as a dove out of the land of Assyria: and I will place
them in their houses, saith the LORD.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C11V12">&nbsp;</a>Ephraim compasseth me about with lies, and the house of Israel with deceit: but Judah yet ruleth with
God, and is faithful with the saints.
