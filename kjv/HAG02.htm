 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C2V1">&nbsp;</a>In the seventh
<span class="add">month,</span> in the one and twentieth
<span class="add">day
</span> of the month, came the word of the LORD by the prophet Haggai, saying,
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C2V2">&nbsp;</a>Speak now to Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and to Joshua the son of Josedech, the
high priest, and to the residue of the people, saying,
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C2V3">&nbsp;</a>Who
<span class="add">is</span> left among you that saw this house in her first glory? and how do ye see it now?
<span class="add">is it</span> not in your eyes in comparison of it as nothing?
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C2V4">&nbsp;</a>Yet now be strong, O Zerubbabel, saith the LORD; and be strong, O Joshua, son of Josedech, the high priest;
and be strong, all ye people of the land, saith the LORD, and work: for
<span class="add">I am</span> with you, saith the LORD of hosts:
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C2V5">&nbsp;</a><span class="add">According to</span> the word that I covenanted with you when ye came out of Egypt, so my spirit remaineth among you: fear
ye not.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C2V6">&nbsp;</a>For thus saith the LORD of hosts; Yet once, it
<span class="add">is</span> a little while, and I will shake the heavens, and the earth, and the sea, and the dry
<span class="add">land;
</span> <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C2V7">&nbsp;</a>And I will shake all nations, and the desire of all nations shall come: and I will fill this house with
glory, saith the LORD of hosts.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C2V8">&nbsp;</a>The silver
<span class="add">is</span> mine, and the gold
<span class="add">is</span> mine, saith the LORD of hosts.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C2V9">&nbsp;</a>The glory of this latter house shall be greater than of the former, saith the LORD of hosts: and in this
place will I give peace, saith the LORD of hosts.

<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C2V10">&nbsp;</a>In the four and twentieth
<span class="add">day</span> of the ninth
<span class="add">month,
</span> in the second year of Darius, came the word of the LORD by Haggai the prophet, saying,
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C2V11">&nbsp;</a>Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Ask now the priests
<span class="add">concerning
</span> the law, saying,
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C2V12">&nbsp;</a>If one bear holy flesh in the skirt of his garment, and with his skirt do touch bread, or pottage, or
wine, or oil, or any meat, shall it be holy? And the priests answered and said, No.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C2V13">&nbsp;</a>Then said Haggai, If
<span class="add">one that is</span> unclean by a dead body touch any of these, shall it be unclean? And the priests answered and said, It
shall be unclean.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C2V14">&nbsp;</a>Then answered Haggai, and said, So
<span class="add">is</span> this people, and so
<span class="add">is</span> this nation before me, saith the LORD; and so
<span class="add">is</span> every work of their hands; and that which they offer there
<span class="add">is</span> unclean.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C2V15">&nbsp;</a>And now, I pray you, consider from this day and upward, from before a stone was laid upon a stone in
the temple of the LORD:
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C2V16">&nbsp;</a>Since those
<span class="add">days</span> were, when
<span class="add">one</span> came to an heap of twenty
<span class="add">measures,</span> there were
<span class="add">but</span> ten: when
<span class="add">one
</span> came to the pressfat for to draw out fifty
<span class="add">vessels</span> out of the press, there were
<span class="add">but</span> twenty.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C2V17">&nbsp;</a>I smote you with blasting and with mildew and with hail in all the labours of your hands; yet ye
<span class="add">turned</span> not to me, saith the LORD.
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C2V18">&nbsp;</a>Consider now from this day and upward, from the four and twentieth day of the ninth
<span class="add">month, even</span> from the day that the foundation of the LORD’S temple was laid, consider
<span class="add">it.
</span> <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C2V19">&nbsp;</a>Is the seed yet in the barn? yea, as yet the vine, and the fig tree, and the pomegranate, and the olive
tree, hath not brought forth: from this day will I bless
<span class="add">you.</span></div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C2V20">&nbsp;</a>And again the word of the LORD came unto Haggai in the four and twentieth
<span class="add">day</span> of the month, saying,
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C2V21">&nbsp;</a>Speak to Zerubbabel, governor of Judah, saying, I will shake the heavens and the earth;
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C2V22">&nbsp;</a>And I will overthrow the throne of kingdoms, and I will destroy the strength of the kingdoms of the heathen;
and I will overthrow the chariots, and those that ride in them; and the horses and their riders shall
come down, every one by the sword of his brother.
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C2V23">&nbsp;</a>In that day, saith the LORD of hosts, will I take thee, O Zerubbabel, my servant, the son of Shealtiel,
saith the LORD, and will make thee as a signet: for I have chosen thee, saith the LORD of hosts.
