 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C15V1">&nbsp;</a>Behold, speak thou in the ears of my people the words of prophecy, which I will put in thy mouth, saith
the Lord:
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C15V2">&nbsp;</a>And cause them to be written in paper: for they are faithful and true.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C15V3">&nbsp;</a>Fear not the imaginations against thee, let not the incredulity of them trouble thee, that speak against
thee.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C15V4">&nbsp;</a>For all the unfaithful shall die in their unfaithfulness.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C15V5">&nbsp;</a>Behold, saith the Lord, I will bring plagues upon the world; the sword, famine, death, and destruction.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C15V6">&nbsp;</a>For wickedness hath exceedingly polluted the whole earth, and their hurtful works are fulfilled.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C15V7">&nbsp;</a>Therefore saith the Lord,
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C15V8">&nbsp;</a>I will hold my tongue no more as touching their wickedness, which they profanely commit, neither will
I suffer them in those things, in which they wickedly exercise themselves: behold, the innocent and righteous
blood crieth unto me, and the souls of the just complain continually.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C15V9">&nbsp;</a>And therefore, saith the Lord, I will surely avenge them, and receive unto me all the innocent blood
from among them.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C15V10">&nbsp;</a>Behold, my people is led as a flock to the slaughter: I will not suffer them now to dwell in the land
of Egypt:
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C15V11">&nbsp;</a>But I will bring them with a mighty hand and a stretched out arm, and smite Egypt with plagues, as before,
and will destroy all the land thereof.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C15V12">&nbsp;</a>Egypt shall mourn, and the foundation of it shall be smitten with the plague and punishment that God
shall bring upon it.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C15V13">&nbsp;</a>They that till the ground shall mourn: for their seeds shall fail through the blasting and hail, and
with a fearful constellation.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C15V14">&nbsp;</a>Woe to the world and them that dwell therein!
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C15V15">&nbsp;</a>For the sword and their destruction draweth nigh, and one people shall stand up and fight against another,
and swords in their hands.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C15V16">&nbsp;</a>For there shall be sedition among men, and invading one another; they shall not regard their kings nor
princes, and the course of their actions shall stand in their power.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C15V17">&nbsp;</a>A man shall desire to go into a city, and shall not be able.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C15V18">&nbsp;</a>For because of their pride the cities shall be troubled, the houses shall be destroyed, and men shall
be afraid.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C15V19">&nbsp;</a>A man shall have no pity upon his neighbour, but shall destroy their houses with the sword, and spoil
their goods, because of the lack of bread, and for great tribulation.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C15V20">&nbsp;</a>Behold, saith God, I will call together all the kings of the earth to reverence me, which are from the
rising of the sun, from the south, from the east, and Libanus; to turn themselves one against another,
and repay the things that they have done to them.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C15V21">&nbsp;</a>Like as they do yet this day unto my chosen, so will I do also, and recompense in their bosom. Thus saith
the Lord God;
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C15V22">&nbsp;</a>My right hand shall not spare the sinners, and my sword shall not cease over them that shed innocent
blood upon the earth.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C15V23">&nbsp;</a>The fire is gone forth from his wrath, and hath consumed the foundations of the earth, and the sinners,
like the straw that is kindled.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C15V24">&nbsp;</a>Woe to them that sin, and keep not my commandments! saith the Lord.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C15V25">&nbsp;</a>I will not spare them: go your way, ye children, from the power, defile not my sanctuary.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C15V26">&nbsp;</a>For the Lord knoweth all them that sin against him, and therefore delivereth he them unto death and destruction.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C15V27">&nbsp;</a>For now are the plagues come upon the whole earth and ye shall remain in them: for God shall not deliver
you, because ye have sinned against him.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C15V28">&nbsp;</a>Behold an horrible vision, and the appearance thereof from the east:
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C15V29">&nbsp;</a>Where the nations of the dragons of Arabia shall come out with many chariots, and the multitude of them
shall be carried as the wind upon earth, that all they which hear them may fear and tremble.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 30</span><a name="C15V30">&nbsp;</a>Also the Carmanians raging in wrath shall go forth as the wild boars of the wood, and with great power
shall they come, and join battle with them, and shall waste a portion of the land of the Assyrians.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 31</span><a name="C15V31">&nbsp;</a>And then shall the dragons have the upper hand, remembering their nature; and if they shall turn themselves,
conspiring together in great power to persecute them,
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 32</span><a name="C15V32">&nbsp;</a>Then these shall be troubled bled, and keep silence through their power, and shall flee.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 33</span><a name="C15V33">&nbsp;</a>And from the land of the Assyrians shall the enemy besiege them, and consume some of them, and in their
host shall be fear and dread, and strife among their kings.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 34</span><a name="C15V34">&nbsp;</a>Behold clouds from the east and from the north unto the south, and they are very horrible to look upon,
full of wrath and storm.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 35</span><a name="C15V35">&nbsp;</a>They shall smite one upon another, and they shall smite down a great multitude of stars upon the earth,
even their own star; and blood shall be from the sword unto the belly,
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 36</span><a name="C15V36">&nbsp;</a>And dung of men unto the camel’s hough.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 37</span><a name="C15V37">&nbsp;</a>And there shall be great fearfulness and trembling upon earth: and they that see the wrath shall be afraid,
and trembling shall come upon them.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 38</span><a name="C15V38">&nbsp;</a>And then shall there come great storms from the south, and from the north, and another part from the
west.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 39</span><a name="C15V39">&nbsp;</a>And strong winds shall arise from the east, and shall open it; and the cloud which he raised up in wrath,
and the star stirred to cause fear toward the east and west wind, shall be destroyed.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 40</span><a name="C15V40">&nbsp;</a>The great and mighty clouds shall be puffed up full of wrath, and the star, that they may make all the
earth afraid, and them that dwell therein; and they shall pour out over every high and eminent place
an horrible star,
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 41</span><a name="C15V41">&nbsp;</a>Fire, and hail, and flying swords, and many waters, that all fields may be full, and all rivers, with
the abundance of great waters.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 42</span><a name="C15V42">&nbsp;</a>And they shall break down the cities and walls, mountains and hills, trees of the wood, and grass of
the meadows, and their corn.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 43</span><a name="C15V43">&nbsp;</a>And they shall go stedfastly unto Babylon, and make her afraid.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 44</span><a name="C15V44">&nbsp;</a>They shall come to her, and besiege her, the star and all wrath shall they pour out upon her: then shall
the dust and smoke go up unto the heaven, and all they that be about her shall bewail her.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 45</span><a name="C15V45">&nbsp;</a>And they that remain under her shall do service unto them that have put her in fear.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 46</span><a name="C15V46">&nbsp;</a>And thou, Asia, that art partaker of the hope of Babylon, and art the glory of her person:
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 47</span><a name="C15V47">&nbsp;</a>Woe be unto thee, thou wretch, because thou hast made thyself like unto her; and hast decked thy daughters
in whoredom, that they might please and glory in thy lovers, which have always desired to commit whoredom
with thee.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 48</span><a name="C15V48">&nbsp;</a>Thou hast followed her that is hated in all her works and inventions: therefore saith God,
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 49</span><a name="C15V49">&nbsp;</a>I will send plagues upon thee; widowhood, poverty, famine, sword, and pestilence, to waste thy houses
with destruction and death.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 50</span><a name="C15V50">&nbsp;</a>And the glory of thy Power shall be dried up as a flower, the heat shall arise that is sent over thee.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 51</span><a name="C15V51">&nbsp;</a>Thou shalt be weakened as a poor woman with stripes, and as one chastised with wounds, so that the mighty
and lovers shall not be able to receive thee.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 52</span><a name="C15V52">&nbsp;</a>Would I with jealousy have so proceeded against thee, saith the Lord,
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 53</span><a name="C15V53">&nbsp;</a>If thou hadst not always slain my chosen, exalting the stroke of thine hands, and saying over their dead,
when thou wast drunken,
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 54</span><a name="C15V54">&nbsp;</a>Set forth the beauty of thy countenance?
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 55</span><a name="C15V55">&nbsp;</a>The reward of thy whoredom shall be in thy bosom, therefore shalt thou receive recompence.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 56</span><a name="C15V56">&nbsp;</a>Like as thou hast done unto my chosen, saith the Lord, even so shall God do unto thee, and shall deliver
thee into mischief
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 57</span><a name="C15V57">&nbsp;</a>Thy children shall die of hunger, and thou shalt fall through the sword: thy cities shall be broken down,
and all thine shall perish with the sword in the field.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 58</span><a name="C15V58">&nbsp;</a>They that be in the mountains shall die of hunger, and eat their own flesh, and drink their own blood,
for very hunger of bread, and thirst of water.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 59</span><a name="C15V59">&nbsp;</a>Thou as unhappy shalt come through the sea, and receive plagues again.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 60</span><a name="C15V60">&nbsp;</a>And in the passage they shall rush on the idle city, and shall destroy some portion of thy land, and
consume part of thy glory, and shall return to Babylon that was destroyed.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 61</span><a name="C15V61">&nbsp;</a>And thou shalt be cast down by them as stubble, and they shall be unto thee as fire;
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 62</span><a name="C15V62">&nbsp;</a>And shall consume thee, and thy cities, thy land, and thy mountains; all thy woods and thy fruitful trees
shall they burn up with fire.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 63</span><a name="C15V63">&nbsp;</a>Thy children shall they carry away captive, and, look, what thou hast, they shall spoil it, and mar the
beauty of thy face.
