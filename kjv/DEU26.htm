 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C26V1">&nbsp;</a>And it shall be, when thou
<span class="add">art</span> come in unto the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee
<span class="add">for</span> an inheritance, and possessest it, and dwellest therein;
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C26V2">&nbsp;</a>That thou shalt take of the first of all the fruit of the earth, which thou shalt bring of thy land that
the LORD thy God giveth thee, and shalt put
<span class="add">it</span> in a basket, and shalt go unto the place which the LORD thy God shall choose to place his name there.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C26V3">&nbsp;</a>And thou shalt go unto the priest that shall be in those days, and say unto him, I profess this day unto
the LORD thy God, that I am come unto the country which the LORD sware unto our fathers for to give us.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C26V4">&nbsp;</a>And the priest shall take the basket out of thine hand, and set it down before the altar of the LORD
thy God.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C26V5">&nbsp;</a>And thou shalt speak and say before the LORD thy God, A Syrian ready to perish
<span class="add">was</span> my father, and he went down into Egypt, and sojourned there with a few, and became there a nation, great,
mighty, and populous:
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C26V6">&nbsp;</a>And the Egyptians evil entreated us, and afflicted us, and laid upon us hard bondage:
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C26V7">&nbsp;</a>And when we cried unto the LORD God of our fathers, the LORD heard our voice, and looked on our affliction,
and our labour, and our oppression:
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C26V8">&nbsp;</a>And the LORD brought us forth out of Egypt with a mighty hand, and with an outstretched arm, and with
great terribleness, and with signs, and with wonders:
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C26V9">&nbsp;</a>And he hath brought us into this place, and hath given us this land,
<span class="add">even</span> a land that floweth with milk and honey.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C26V10">&nbsp;</a>And now, behold, I have brought the firstfruits of the land, which thou, O LORD, hast given me. And thou
shalt set it before the LORD thy God, and worship before the LORD thy God:
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C26V11">&nbsp;</a>And thou shalt rejoice in every good
<span class="add">thing</span> which the LORD thy God hath given unto thee, and unto thine house, thou, and the Levite, and the stranger
that
<span class="add">is</span> among you.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C26V12">&nbsp;</a>When thou hast made an end of tithing all the tithes of thine increase the third year,
<span class="add">which is</span> the year of tithing, and hast given
<span class="add">it</span> unto the Levite, the stranger, the fatherless, and the widow, that they may eat within thy gates, and
be filled;
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C26V13">&nbsp;</a>Then thou shalt say before the LORD thy God, I have brought away the hallowed things out of
<span class="add">mine</span> house, and also have given them unto the Levite, and unto the stranger, to the fatherless, and to the
widow, according to all thy commandments which thou hast commanded me: I have not transgressed thy commandments,
neither have I forgotten
<span class="add">them:
</span> <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C26V14">&nbsp;</a>I have not eaten thereof in my mourning, neither have I taken away
<span class="add">ought</span> thereof for
<span class="add">any</span> unclean
<span class="add">use,</span> nor given
<span class="add">ought</span> thereof for the dead:
<span class="add">but</span> I have hearkened to the voice of the LORD my God,
<span class="add">and</span> have done according to all that thou hast commanded me.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C26V15">&nbsp;</a>Look down from thy holy habitation, from heaven, and bless thy people Israel, and the land which thou
hast given us, as thou swarest unto our fathers, a land that floweth with milk and honey.

<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C26V16">&nbsp;</a>This day the LORD thy God hath commanded thee to do these statutes and judgments: thou shalt therefore
keep and do them with all thine heart, and with all thy soul.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C26V17">&nbsp;</a>Thou hast avouched the LORD this day to be thy God, and to walk in his ways, and to keep his statutes,
and his commandments, and his judgments, and to hearken unto his voice:
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C26V18">&nbsp;</a>And the LORD hath avouched thee this day to be his peculiar people, as he hath promised thee, and that
<span class="add">thou</span> shouldest keep all his commandments;
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C26V19">&nbsp;</a>And to make thee high above all nations which he hath made, in praise, and in name, and in honour; and
that thou mayest be an holy people unto the LORD thy God, as he hath spoken.
