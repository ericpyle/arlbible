<div class="chapterlabel"> 41</div><div class="p">
 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C41V1">&nbsp;</a>And it came to pass at the end of two full years, that Pharaoh dreamed: and, behold, he stood by the
river.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C41V2">&nbsp;</a>And, behold, there came up out of the river seven well favoured kine and fatfleshed; and they fed in
a meadow.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C41V3">&nbsp;</a>And, behold, seven other kine came up after them out of the river, ill favoured and leanfleshed; and
stood by the
<span class="add">other</span> kine upon the brink of the river.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C41V4">&nbsp;</a>And the ill favoured and leanfleshed kine did eat up the seven well favoured and fat kine. So Pharaoh
awoke.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C41V5">&nbsp;</a>And he slept and dreamed the second time: and, behold, seven ears of corn came up upon one stalk, rank
and good.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C41V6">&nbsp;</a>And, behold, seven thin ears and blasted with the east wind sprung up after them.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C41V7">&nbsp;</a>And the seven thin ears devoured the seven rank and full ears. And Pharaoh awoke, and, behold,
<span class="add">it was</span> a dream.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C41V8">&nbsp;</a>And it came to pass in the morning that his spirit was troubled; and he sent and called for all the magicians
of Egypt, and all the wise men thereof: and Pharaoh told them his dream; but
<span class="add">there was</span> none that could interpret them unto Pharaoh.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C41V9">&nbsp;</a>Then spake the chief butler unto Pharaoh, saying, I do remember my faults this day:
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C41V10">&nbsp;</a>Pharaoh was wroth with his servants, and put me in ward in the captain of the guard’s house, both
<span class="add">me</span> and the chief baker:
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C41V11">&nbsp;</a>And we dreamed a dream in one night, I and he; we dreamed each man according to the interpretation of
his dream.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C41V12">&nbsp;</a>And
<span class="add">there was</span> there with us a young man, an Hebrew, servant to the captain of the guard; and we told him, and he interpreted
to us our dreams; to each man according to his dream he did interpret.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C41V13">&nbsp;</a>And it came to pass, as he interpreted to us, so it was; me he restored unto mine office, and him he
hanged.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C41V14">&nbsp;</a>Then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph, and they brought him hastily out of the dungeon: and he shaved
<span class="add">himself,</span> and changed his raiment, and came in unto Pharaoh.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C41V15">&nbsp;</a>And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I have dreamed a dream, and
<span class="add">there is
</span> none that can interpret it: and I have heard say of thee,
<span class="add">that
</span> thou canst understand a dream to interpret it.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C41V16">&nbsp;</a>And Joseph answered Pharaoh, saying,
<span class="add">It is</span> not in me: God shall give Pharaoh an answer of peace.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C41V17">&nbsp;</a>And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, In my dream, behold, I stood upon the bank of the river:
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C41V18">&nbsp;</a>And, behold, there came up out of the river seven kine, fatfleshed and well favoured; and they fed in
a meadow:
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C41V19">&nbsp;</a>And, behold, seven other kine came up after them, poor and very ill favoured and leanfleshed, such as
I never saw in all the land of Egypt for badness:
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C41V20">&nbsp;</a>And the lean and the ill favoured kine did eat up the first seven fat kine:
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C41V21">&nbsp;</a>And when they had eaten them up, it could not be known that they had eaten them; but they
<span class="add">were</span> still ill favoured, as at the beginning. So I awoke.
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C41V22">&nbsp;</a>And I saw in my dream, and, behold, seven ears came up in one stalk, full and good:
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C41V23">&nbsp;</a>And, behold, seven ears, withered, thin,
<span class="add">and</span> blasted with the east wind, sprung up after them:
 <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C41V24">&nbsp;</a>And the thin ears devoured the seven good ears: and I told
<span class="add">this
</span> unto the magicians; but
<span class="add">there was</span> none that could declare
<span class="add">it</span> to me.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C41V25">&nbsp;</a>And Joseph said unto Pharaoh, The dream of Pharaoh
<span class="add">is</span> one: God hath shewed Pharaoh what he
<span class="add">is</span> about to do.
 <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C41V26">&nbsp;</a>The seven good kine
<span class="add">are</span> seven years; and the seven good ears
<span class="add">are</span> seven years: the dream
<span class="add">is</span> one.
 <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C41V27">&nbsp;</a>And the seven thin and ill favoured kine that came up after them
<span class="add">are</span> seven years; and the seven empty ears blasted with the east wind shall be seven years of famine.
 <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C41V28">&nbsp;</a>This
<span class="add">is</span> the thing which I have spoken unto Pharaoh: What God
<span class="add">is</span> about to do he sheweth unto Pharaoh.
 <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C41V29">&nbsp;</a>Behold, there come seven years of great plenty throughout all the land of Egypt:
 <span class="verse"> 30</span><a name="C41V30">&nbsp;</a>And there shall arise after them seven years of famine; and all the plenty shall be forgotten in the
land of Egypt; and the famine shall consume the land;
 <span class="verse"> 31</span><a name="C41V31">&nbsp;</a>And the plenty shall not be known in the land by reason of that famine following; for it
<span class="add">shall be</span> very grievous.
 <span class="verse"> 32</span><a name="C41V32">&nbsp;</a>And for that the dream was doubled unto Pharaoh twice;
<span class="add">it is
</span> because the thing
<span class="add">is</span> established by God, and God will shortly bring it to pass.
 <span class="verse"> 33</span><a name="C41V33">&nbsp;</a>Now therefore let Pharaoh look out a man discreet and wise, and set him over the land of Egypt.
 <span class="verse"> 34</span><a name="C41V34">&nbsp;</a>Let Pharaoh do
<span class="add">this,</span> and let him appoint officers over the land, and take up the fifth part of the land of Egypt in the seven
plenteous years.
 <span class="verse"> 35</span><a name="C41V35">&nbsp;</a>And let them gather all the food of those good years that come, and lay up corn under the hand of Pharaoh,
and let them keep food in the cities.
 <span class="verse"> 36</span><a name="C41V36">&nbsp;</a>And that food shall be for store to the land against the seven years of famine, which shall be in the
land of Egypt; that the land perish not through the famine.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 37</span><a name="C41V37">&nbsp;</a>And the thing was good in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of all his servants.
 <span class="verse"> 38</span><a name="C41V38">&nbsp;</a>And Pharaoh said unto his servants, Can we find
<span class="add">such a one
</span> as this
<span class="add">is,</span> a man in whom the Spirit of God is?
 <span class="verse"> 39</span><a name="C41V39">&nbsp;</a>And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, Forasmuch as God hath shewed thee all this,
<span class="add">there is</span> none so discreet and wise as thou
<span class="add">art:
</span> <span class="verse"> 40</span><a name="C41V40">&nbsp;</a>Thou shalt be over my house, and according unto thy word shall all my people be ruled: only in the throne
will I be greater than thou.
 <span class="verse"> 41</span><a name="C41V41">&nbsp;</a>And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, See, I have set thee over all the land of Egypt.
 <span class="verse"> 42</span><a name="C41V42">&nbsp;</a>And Pharaoh took off his ring from his hand, and put it upon Joseph’s hand, and arrayed him in vestures
of fine linen, and put a gold chain about his neck;
 <span class="verse"> 43</span><a name="C41V43">&nbsp;</a>And he made him to ride in the second chariot which he had; and they cried before him, Bow the knee:
and he made him
<span class="add">ruler</span> over all the land of Egypt.
 <span class="verse"> 44</span><a name="C41V44">&nbsp;</a>And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I
<span class="add">am</span> Pharaoh, and without thee shall no man lift up his hand or foot in all the land of Egypt.
 <span class="verse"> 45</span><a name="C41V45">&nbsp;</a>And Pharaoh called Joseph’s name Zaphnath-paaneah; and he gave him to wife Asenath the daughter of Poti-
pherah priest of On. And Joseph went out over
<span class="add">all</span> the land of Egypt.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 46</span><a name="C41V46">&nbsp;</a>And Joseph
<span class="add">was</span> thirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh king of Egypt. And Joseph went out from the presence of
Pharaoh, and went throughout all the land of Egypt.
 <span class="verse"> 47</span><a name="C41V47">&nbsp;</a>And in the seven plenteous years the earth brought forth by handfuls.
 <span class="verse"> 48</span><a name="C41V48">&nbsp;</a>And he gathered up all the food of the seven years, which were in the land of Egypt, and laid up the
food in the cities: the food of the field, which
<span class="add">was</span> round about every city, laid he up in the same.
 <span class="verse"> 49</span><a name="C41V49">&nbsp;</a>And Joseph gathered corn as the sand of the sea, very much, until he left numbering; for
<span class="add">it was</span> without number.
 <span class="verse"> 50</span><a name="C41V50">&nbsp;</a>And unto Joseph were born two sons before the years of famine came, which Asenath the daughter of Poti-
pherah priest of On bare unto him.
 <span class="verse"> 51</span><a name="C41V51">&nbsp;</a>And Joseph called the name of the firstborn Manasseh: For God,
<span class="add">said he,</span> hath made me forget all my toil, and all my father’s house.
 <span class="verse"> 52</span><a name="C41V52">&nbsp;</a>And the name of the second called he Ephraim: For God hath caused me to be fruitful in the land of my
affliction.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 53</span><a name="C41V53">&nbsp;</a>And the seven years of plenteousness, that was in the land of Egypt, were ended.
 <span class="verse"> 54</span><a name="C41V54">&nbsp;</a>And the seven years of dearth began to come, according as Joseph had said: and the dearth was in all
lands; but in all the land of Egypt there was bread.
 <span class="verse"> 55</span><a name="C41V55">&nbsp;</a>And when all the land of Egypt was famished, the people cried to Pharaoh for bread: and Pharaoh said
unto all the Egyptians, Go unto Joseph; what he saith to you, do.
 <span class="verse"> 56</span><a name="C41V56">&nbsp;</a>And the famine was over all the face of the earth: and Joseph opened all the storehouses, and sold unto
the Egyptians; and the famine waxed sore in the land of Egypt.
 <span class="verse"> 57</span><a name="C41V57">&nbsp;</a>And all countries came into Egypt to Joseph for to buy
<span class="add">corn;
</span> because that the famine was so sore in all lands.
