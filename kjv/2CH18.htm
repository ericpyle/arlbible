 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C18V1">&nbsp;</a>Now Jehoshaphat had riches and honour in abundance, and joined affinity with Ahab.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C18V2">&nbsp;</a>And after
<span class="add">certain</span> years he went down to Ahab to Samaria. And Ahab killed sheep and oxen for him in abundance, and for
the people that
<span class="add">he had</span> with him, and persuaded him to go up
<span class="add">with him
</span> to Ramoth-gilead.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C18V3">&nbsp;</a>And Ahab king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat king of Judah, Wilt thou go with me to Ramoth-gilead? And
he answered him, I
<span class="add">am</span> as thou
<span class="add">art,</span> and my people as thy people; and
<span class="add">we will be</span> with thee in the war.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C18V4">&nbsp;</a>And Jehoshaphat said unto the king of Israel, Enquire, I pray thee, at the word of the LORD to day.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C18V5">&nbsp;</a>Therefore the king of Israel gathered together of prophets four hundred men, and said unto them, Shall
we go to Ramoth-gilead to battle, or shall I forbear? And they said, Go up; for God will deliver
<span class="add">it</span> into the king’s hand.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C18V6">&nbsp;</a>But Jehoshaphat said,
<span class="add">Is there</span> not here a prophet of the LORD besides, that we might enquire of him?
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C18V7">&nbsp;</a>And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat,
<span class="add">There is</span> yet one man, by whom we may enquire of the LORD: but I hate him; for he never prophesied good unto me,
but always evil: the same is Micaiah the son of Imla. And Jehoshaphat said, Let not the king say so.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C18V8">&nbsp;</a>And the king of Israel called for one
<span class="add">of his</span> officers, and said, Fetch quickly Micaiah the son of Imla.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C18V9">&nbsp;</a>And the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat king of Judah sat either of them on his throne, clothed in
<span class="add">their</span> robes, and they sat in a void place at the entering in of the gate of Samaria; and all the prophets
prophesied before them.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C18V10">&nbsp;</a>And Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah had made him horns of iron, and said, Thus saith the LORD, With these
thou shalt push Syria until they be consumed.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C18V11">&nbsp;</a>And all the prophets prophesied so, saying, Go up to Ramoth-gilead, and prosper: for the LORD shall deliver
<span class="add">it</span> into the hand of the king.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C18V12">&nbsp;</a>And the messenger that went to call Micaiah spake to him, saying, Behold, the words of the prophets
<span class="add">declare</span> good to the king with one assent; let thy word therefore, I pray thee, be like one of theirs, and speak
thou good.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C18V13">&nbsp;</a>And Micaiah said,
<span class="add">As</span> the LORD liveth, even what my God saith, that will I speak.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C18V14">&nbsp;</a>And when he was come to the king, the king said unto him, Micaiah, shall we go to Ramoth-gilead to battle,
or shall I forbear? And he said, Go ye up, and prosper, and they shall be delivered into your hand.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C18V15">&nbsp;</a>And the king said to him, How many times shall I adjure thee that thou say nothing but the truth to me
in the name of the LORD?
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C18V16">&nbsp;</a>Then he said, I did see all Israel scattered upon the mountains, as sheep that have no shepherd: and
the LORD said, These have no master; let them return
<span class="add">therefore</span> every man to his house in peace.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C18V17">&nbsp;</a>And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, Did I not tell thee
<span class="add">that</span> he would not prophesy good unto me, but evil?
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C18V18">&nbsp;</a>Again he said, Therefore hear the word of the LORD; I saw the LORD sitting upon his throne, and all the
host of heaven standing on his right hand and
<span class="add">on</span> his left.
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C18V19">&nbsp;</a>And the LORD said, Who shall entice Ahab king of Israel, that he may go up and fall at Ramoth-gilead?
And one spake saying after this manner, and another saying after that manner.
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C18V20">&nbsp;</a>Then there came out a spirit, and stood before the LORD, and said, I will entice him. And the LORD said
unto him, Wherewith?
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C18V21">&nbsp;</a>And he said, I will go out, and be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets. And
<span class="add">the LORD</span> said, Thou shalt entice
<span class="add">him,
</span> and thou shalt also prevail: go out, and do
<span class="add">even</span> so.
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C18V22">&nbsp;</a>Now therefore, behold, the LORD hath put a lying spirit in the mouth of these thy prophets, and the LORD
hath spoken evil against thee.
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C18V23">&nbsp;</a>Then Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah came near, and smote Micaiah upon the cheek, and said, Which way went
the Spirit of the LORD from me to speak unto thee?
 <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C18V24">&nbsp;</a>And Micaiah said, Behold, thou shalt see on that day when thou shalt go into an inner chamber to hide
thyself.
 <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C18V25">&nbsp;</a>Then the king of Israel said, Take ye Micaiah, and carry him back to Amon the governor of the city, and
to Joash the king’s son;
 <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C18V26">&nbsp;</a>And say, Thus saith the king, Put this
<span class="add">fellow</span> in the prison, and feed him with bread of affliction and with water of affliction, until I return in
peace.
 <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C18V27">&nbsp;</a>And Micaiah said, If thou certainly return in peace,
<span class="add">then
</span> hath not the LORD spoken by me. And he said, Hearken, all ye people.
 <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C18V28">&nbsp;</a>So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went up to Ramoth-gilead.
 <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C18V29">&nbsp;</a>And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, I will disguise myself, and will go to the battle; but
put thou on thy robes. So the king of Israel disguised himself; and they went to the battle.
 <span class="verse"> 30</span><a name="C18V30">&nbsp;</a>Now the king of Syria had commanded the captains of the chariots that
<span class="add">were</span> with him, saying, Fight ye not with small or great, save only with the king of Israel.
 <span class="verse"> 31</span><a name="C18V31">&nbsp;</a>And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat, that they said, It
<span class="add">is</span> the king of Israel. Therefore they compassed about him to fight: but Jehoshaphat cried out, and the
LORD helped him; and God moved them
<span class="add">to depart</span> from him.
 <span class="verse"> 32</span><a name="C18V32">&nbsp;</a>For it came to pass, that, when the captains of the chariots perceived that it was not the king of Israel,
they turned back again from pursuing him.
 <span class="verse"> 33</span><a name="C18V33">&nbsp;</a>And a
<span class="add">certain</span> man drew a bow at a venture, and smote the king of Israel between the joints of the harness: therefore
he said to his chariot man, Turn thine hand, that thou mayest carry me out of the host; for I am wounded.
 <span class="verse"> 34</span><a name="C18V34">&nbsp;</a>And the battle increased that day: howbeit the king of Israel stayed
<span class="add">himself</span> up in
<span class="add">his</span> chariot against the Syrians until the even: and about the time of the sun going down he died.
