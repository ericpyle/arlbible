Gershom: of the sons of Ithamar; Daniel: of the sons of David; Hattush.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>Of the sons of Shechaniah, of the sons of Pharosh; Zechariah: and with him were reckoned by genealogy of the males an hundred and fifty.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>Of the sons of Pahath-moab;

Ebed the son of Jonathan, and with him fifty males.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>And of the sons of Elam; Jeshaiah the son of Athaliah, and with him seventy males.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>And of the sons of Shephatiah;

Uthai, and Zabbud, and with them seventy males. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>And I gathered them together to the river than runneth to Ahava; and there abode we in tents three days: and I viewed the people, and the priests, and found there none of the sons of Levi.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>Then sent I for Eliezer, for Ariel, for Shemaiah, and for Elnathan, and for Jarib, and for Elnathan, and for Nathan, and for Zechariah, and for Meshullam, chief men; also for Joiarib, and for Elnathan, men of understanding.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>And I sent them with commandment unto Iddo the chief at the place Casiphia, and I told them what they should say unto Iddo, <span class='add'>and</span> to his brethren the Nethinims, at the place Casiphia, that they should bring unto us ministers for the house of our God.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>And by the good hand of our God upon us they brought us a man of understanding, of the sons of Mahli, the son of Levi, the son of Israel; and Sherebiah, with his sons and his brethren, eighteen;  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>And Hashabiah, and with him Jeshaiah of the sons of Merari, his brethren and their sons, twenty;  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>Also of the Nethinims, whom David and the princes had appointed for the service of the Levites, two hundred and twenty Nethinims: all of them were expressed by name. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>Then I proclaimed a fast there, at the river of Ahava, that we might afflict ourselves before our God, to seek of him a right way for us, and for our little ones, and for all our substance.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>For I was ashamed to require of the king a band of soldiers and horsemen to help us against the enemy in the way: because we had spoken unto the king, saying, The hand of our God <span class='add'>is</span> upon all them for good that seek him; but his power and his wrath <span class='add'>is</span> against all them that forsake him.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>So we fasted and besought our God for this: and he was intreated of us. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>Then I separated twelve of the chief of the priests, Sherebiah, Hashabiah, and ten of their brethren with them,  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>And weighed unto them the silver, and the gold, and the vessels, <span class='add'>even</span> the offering of the house of our God, which the king, and his counsellors, and his lords, and all Israel <span class='add'>there</span> present, had offered:  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>I even weighed unto their hand six hundred and fifty talents of silver, and silver vessels an hundred talents, <span class='add'>and</span> of gold an hundred talents;  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>Also twenty basons of gold, of a thousand drams; and two vessels of fine copper, precious as gold.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&nbsp;</span>And I said unto them, Ye <span class='add'>are</span> holy unto the LORD; the vessels <span class='add'>are</span> holy also; and the silver and the gold <span class='add'>are</span> a freewill offering unto the LORD God of your fathers.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&nbsp;</span>Watch ye, and keep <span class='add'>them</span>, until ye weigh <span class='add'>them</span> before the chief of the priests and the Levites, and chief of the fathers of Israel, at Jerusalem, in the chambers of the house of the LORD.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&nbsp;</span>So took the priests and the Levites the weight of the silver, and the gold, and the vessels, to bring <span class='add'>them</span> to Jerusalem unto the house of our God. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V31">31&nbsp;</span>Then we departed from the river of Ahava on the twelfth <span class='add'>day</span> of the first month, to go unto Jerusalem: and the hand of our God was upon us, and he delivered us from the hand of the enemy, and of such as lay in wait by the way.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&nbsp;</span>And we came to Jerusalem, and abode there three days. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V33">33&nbsp;</span>Now on the fourth day was the silver and the gold and the vessels weighed in the house of our God by the hand of Meremoth the son of Uriah the priest;
