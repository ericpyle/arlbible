 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C46V1">&nbsp;</a>Jesus the son a Nave was valiant in the wars, and was the successor of Moses in prophecies, who according
to his name was made great for the saving of the elect of God, and taking vengeance of the enemies that
rose up against them, that he might set Israel in their inheritance.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C46V2">&nbsp;</a>How great glory gat he, when he did lift up his hands, and stretched out his sword against the cities!
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C46V3">&nbsp;</a>Who before him so stood to it? for the Lord himself brought his enemies unto him.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C46V4">&nbsp;</a>Did not the sun go back by his means? and was not one day as long as two?
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C46V5">&nbsp;</a>He called upon the most high Lord, when the enemies pressed upon him on every side; and the great Lord
heard him.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C46V6">&nbsp;</a>And with hailstones of mighty power he made the battle to fall violently upon the nations, and in the
descent
<span class="add">of Beth-horon</span> he destroyed them that resisted, that the nations might know all their strength, because he fought in
the sight of the Lord, and he followed the Mighty One.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C46V7">&nbsp;</a>In the time of Moses also he did a work of mercy, he and Caleb the son of Jephunne, in that they withstood
the congregation, and withheld the people from sin, and appeased the wicked murmuring.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C46V8">&nbsp;</a>And of six hundred thousand people on foot, they two were preserved to bring them in to the heritage,
even unto the land that floweth with milk and honey.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C46V9">&nbsp;</a>The Lord gave strength also unto Caleb, which remained with him unto his old age: so that he entered
upon the high places of the land, and his seed obtained it for an heritage:
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C46V10">&nbsp;</a>That all the children of Israel might see that it is good to follow the Lord.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C46V11">&nbsp;</a>And concerning the judges, every one by name, whose heart went not a whoring, nor departed from the Lord,
let their memory be blessed.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C46V12">&nbsp;</a>Let their bones flourish out of their place, and let the name of them that were honoured be continued
upon their children.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C46V13">&nbsp;</a>Samuel, the prophet of the Lord, beloved of his Lord, established a kingdom, and anointed princes over
his people.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C46V14">&nbsp;</a>By the law of the Lord he judged the congregation, and the Lord had respect unto Jacob.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C46V15">&nbsp;</a>By his faithfulness he was found a true prophet, and by his word he was known to be faithful in vision.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C46V16">&nbsp;</a>He called upon the mighty Lord, when his enemies pressed upon him on every side, when he offered the
sucking lamb.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C46V17">&nbsp;</a>And the Lord thundered from heaven, and with a great noise made his voice to be heard.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C46V18">&nbsp;</a>And he destroyed the rulers of the Tyrians, and all the princes cf the Philistines.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C46V19">&nbsp;</a>And before his long sleep he made protestations in the sight of the Lord and his anointed, I have not
taken any man’s goods, so much as a shoe: and no man did accuse him.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C46V20">&nbsp;</a>And after his death he prophesied, and shewed the king his end, and lifted up his voice from the earth
in prophecy, to blot out the wickedness of the people.
