 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C23V1">&nbsp;</a>Now these
<span class="add">be</span> the last words of David. David the son of Jesse said, and the man
<span class="add">who was</span> raised up on high, the anointed of the God of Jacob, and the sweet psalmist of Israel, said,
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C23V2">&nbsp;</a>The Spirit of the LORD spake by me, and his word
<span class="add">was</span> in my tongue.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C23V3">&nbsp;</a>The God of Israel said, the Rock of Israel spake to me, He that ruleth over men
<span class="add">must be</span> just, ruling in the fear of God.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C23V4">&nbsp;</a>And
<span class="add">he shall be</span> as the light of the morning,
<span class="add">when
</span> the sun riseth,
<span class="add">even</span> a morning without clouds;
<span class="add">as
</span> the tender grass
<span class="add">springing</span> out of the earth by clear shining after rain.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C23V5">&nbsp;</a>Although my house
<span class="add">be</span> not so with God; yet he hath made with me an everlasting covenant, ordered in all
<span class="add">things,</span> and sure: for
<span class="add">this is</span> all my salvation, and all
<span class="add">my</span> desire, although he make
<span class="add">it</span> not to grow.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C23V6">&nbsp;</a>But
<span class="add">the sons</span> of Belial
<span class="add">shall be</span> all of them as thorns thrust away, because they cannot be taken with hands:
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C23V7">&nbsp;</a>But the man
<span class="add">that</span> shall touch them must be fenced with iron and the staff of a spear; and they shall be utterly burned
with fire in the
<span class="add">same</span> place.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C23V8">&nbsp;</a>These
<span class="add">be</span> the names of the mighty men whom David had: The Tachmonite that sat in the seat, chief among the captains;
the same
<span class="add">was</span> Adino the Eznite:
<span class="add">he lift up his spear</span> against eight hundred, whom he slew at one time.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C23V9">&nbsp;</a>And after him
<span class="add">was</span> Eleazar the son of Dodo the Ahohite,
<span class="add">one</span> of the three mighty men with David, when they defied the Philistines
<span class="add">that</span> were there gathered together to battle, and the men of Israel were gone away:
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C23V10">&nbsp;</a>He arose, and smote the Philistines until his hand was weary, and his hand clave unto the sword: and
the LORD wrought a great victory that day; and the people returned after him only to spoil.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C23V11">&nbsp;</a>And after him
<span class="add">was</span> Shammah the son of Agee the Hararite. And the Philistines were gathered together into a troop, where
was a piece of ground full of lentiles: and the people fled from the Philistines.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C23V12">&nbsp;</a>But he stood in the midst of the ground, and defended it, and slew the Philistines: and the LORD wrought
a great victory.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C23V13">&nbsp;</a>And three of the thirty chief went down, and came to David in the harvest time unto the cave of Adullam:
and the troop of the Philistines pitched in the valley of Rephaim.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C23V14">&nbsp;</a>And David
<span class="add">was</span> then in an hold, and the garrison of the Philistines
<span class="add">was</span> then
<span class="add">in</span> Bethlehem.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C23V15">&nbsp;</a>And David longed, and said, Oh that one would give me drink of the water of the well of Bethlehem, which
<span class="add">is</span> by the gate!
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C23V16">&nbsp;</a>And the three mighty men brake through the host of the Philistines, and drew water out of the well of
Bethlehem, that
<span class="add">was</span> by the gate, and took
<span class="add">it,</span> and brought
<span class="add">it</span> to David: nevertheless he would not drink thereof, but poured it out unto the LORD.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C23V17">&nbsp;</a>And he said, Be it far from me, O LORD, that I should do this:
<span class="add">is not this</span> the blood of the men that went in jeopardy of their lives? therefore he would not drink it. These things
did these three mighty men.
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C23V18">&nbsp;</a>And Abishai, the brother of Joab, the son of Zeruiah, was chief among three. And he lifted up his spear
against three hundred,
<span class="add">and</span> slew
<span class="add">them,</span> and had the name among three.
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C23V19">&nbsp;</a>Was he not most honourable of three? therefore he was their captain: howbeit he attained not unto the
<span class="add">first</span> three.
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C23V20">&nbsp;</a>And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the son of a valiant man, of Kabzeel, who had done many acts, he slew
two lionlike men of Moab: he went down also and slew a lion in the midst of a pit in time of snow:
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C23V21">&nbsp;</a>And he slew an Egyptian, a goodly man: and the Egyptian had a spear in his hand; but he went down to
him with a staff, and plucked the spear out of the Egyptian’s hand, and slew him with his own spear.
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C23V22">&nbsp;</a>These
<span class="add">things</span> did Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and had the name among three mighty men.
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C23V23">&nbsp;</a>He was more honourable than the thirty, but he attained not to the
<span class="add">first</span> three. And David set him over his guard.
 <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C23V24">&nbsp;</a>Asahel the brother of Joab
<span class="add">was</span> one of the thirty; Elhanan the son of Dodo of Bethlehem,
