 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C12V1">&nbsp;</a>Now the LORD had said unto Abram, Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father’s
house, unto a land that I will shew thee:
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C12V2">&nbsp;</a>And I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee, and make thy name great; and thou shalt
be a blessing:
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C12V3">&nbsp;</a>And I will bless them that bless thee, and curse him that curseth thee: and in thee shall all families
of the earth be blessed.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C12V4">&nbsp;</a>So Abram departed, as the LORD had spoken unto him; and Lot went with him: and Abram
<span class="add">was</span> seventy and five years old when he departed out of Haran.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C12V5">&nbsp;</a>And Abram took Sarai his wife, and Lot his brother’s son, and all their substance that they had gathered,
and the souls that they had gotten in Haran; and they went forth to go into the land of Canaan; and into
the land of Canaan they came.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C12V6">&nbsp;</a>And Abram passed through the land unto the place of Sichem, unto the plain of Moreh. And the Canaanite
<span class="add">was</span> then in the land.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C12V7">&nbsp;</a>And the LORD appeared unto Abram, and said, Unto thy seed will I give this land: and there builded he
an altar unto the LORD, who appeared unto him.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C12V8">&nbsp;</a>And he removed from thence unto a mountain on the east of Bethel, and pitched his tent,
<span class="add">having</span> Bethel on the west, and Hai on the east: and there he builded an altar unto the LORD, and called upon
the name of the LORD.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C12V9">&nbsp;</a>And Abram journeyed, going on still toward the south.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C12V10">&nbsp;</a>And there was a famine in the land: and Abram went down into Egypt to sojourn there; for the famine
<span class="add">was</span> grievous in the land.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C12V11">&nbsp;</a>And it came to pass, when he was come near to enter into Egypt, that he said unto Sarai his wife, Behold
now, I know that thou
<span class="add">art</span> a fair woman to look upon:
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C12V12">&nbsp;</a>Therefore it shall come to pass, when the Egyptians shall see thee, that they shall say, This
<span class="add">is</span> his wife: and they will kill me, but they will save thee alive.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C12V13">&nbsp;</a>Say, I pray thee, thou
<span class="add">art</span> my sister: that it may be well with me for thy sake; and my soul shall live because of thee.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C12V14">&nbsp;</a>And it came to pass, that, when Abram was come into Egypt, the Egyptians beheld the woman that she
<span class="add">was</span> very fair.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C12V15">&nbsp;</a>The princes also of Pharaoh saw her, and commended her before Pharaoh: and the woman was taken into Pharaoh’s
house.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C12V16">&nbsp;</a>And he entreated Abram well for her sake: and he had sheep, and oxen, and he asses, and menservants,
and maidservants, and she asses, and camels.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C12V17">&nbsp;</a>And the LORD plagued Pharaoh and his house with great plagues because of Sarai Abram’s wife.
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C12V18">&nbsp;</a>And Pharaoh called Abram, and said, What
<span class="add">is</span> this
<span class="add">that</span> thou hast done unto me? why didst thou not tell me that she
<span class="add">was</span> thy wife?
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C12V19">&nbsp;</a>Why saidst thou, She
<span class="add">is</span> my sister? so I might have taken her to me to wife: now therefore behold thy wife, take
<span class="add">her,</span> and go thy way.
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C12V20">&nbsp;</a>And Pharaoh commanded
<span class="add">his</span> men concerning him: and they sent him away, and his wife, and all that he had.
