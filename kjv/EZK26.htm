 <span class="verse" id="V1">1&nbsp;</span>And it came to pass in the eleventh year, in the first <span class='add'>day</span> of the month, <span class='add'>that</span> the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span>Son of man, because that Tyrus hath said against Jerusalem, Aha, she is broken <span class='add'>that was</span> the gates of the people: she is turned unto me: I shall be replenished, <span class='add'>now</span> she is laid waste:  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I <span class='add'>am</span> against thee, O Tyrus, and will cause many nations to come up against thee, as the sea causeth his waves to come up.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>And they shall destroy the walls of Tyrus, and break down her towers: I will also scrape her dust from her, and make her like the top of a rock.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>It shall be <span class='add'>a place for</span> the spreading of nets in the midst of the sea: for I have spoken <span class='add'>it</span>, saith the Lord GOD: and it shall become a spoil to the nations.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>And her daughters which <span class='add'>are</span> in the field shall be slain by the sword; and they shall know that I <span class='add'>am</span> the LORD. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>For thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will bring upon Tyrus Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, a king of kings, from the north, with horses, and with chariots, and with horsemen, and companies, and much people.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>He shall slay with the sword thy daughters in the field: and he shall make a fort against thee, and cast a mount against thee, and lift up the buckler against thee.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>And he shall set engines of war against thy walls, and with his axes he shall break down thy towers.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>By reason of the abundance of his horses their dust shall cover thee: thy walls shall shake at the noise of the horsemen, and of the wheels, and of the chariots, when he shall enter into thy gates, as men enter into a city wherein is made a breach.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>With the hoofs of his horses shall he tread down all thy streets: he shall slay thy people by the sword, and thy strong garrisons shall go down to the ground.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>And they shall make a spoil of thy riches, and make a prey of thy merchandise: and they shall break down thy walls, and destroy thy pleasant houses: and they shall lay thy stones and thy timber and thy dust in the midst of the water.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>And I will cause the noise of thy songs to cease; and the sound of thy harps shall be no more heard.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>And I will make thee like the top of a rock: thou shalt be <span class='add'>a place</span> to spread nets upon; thou shalt be built no more: for I the LORD have spoken <span class='add'>it</span>, saith the Lord GOD. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>Thus saith the Lord GOD to Tyrus; Shall not the isles shake at the sound of thy fall, when the wounded cry, when the slaughter is made in the midst of thee?
