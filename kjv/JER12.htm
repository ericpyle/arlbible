 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C12V1">&nbsp;</a>Righteous
<span class="add">art</span> thou, O LORD, when I plead with thee: yet let me talk with thee of
<span class="add">thy</span> judgments: Wherefore doth the way of the wicked prosper?
<span class="add">wherefore</span> are all they happy that deal very treacherously?
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C12V2">&nbsp;</a>Thou hast planted them, yea, they have taken root: they grow, yea, they bring forth fruit: thou
<span class="add">art</span> near in their mouth, and far from their reins.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C12V3">&nbsp;</a>But thou, O LORD, knowest me: thou hast seen me, and tried mine heart toward thee: pull them out like
sheep for the slaughter, and prepare them for the day of slaughter.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C12V4">&nbsp;</a>How long shall the land mourn, and the herbs of every field wither, for the wickedness of them that dwell
therein? the beasts are consumed, and the birds; because they said, He shall not see our last end.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C12V5">&nbsp;</a>If thou hast run with the footmen, and they have wearied thee, then how canst thou contend with horses?
and
<span class="add">if</span> in the land of peace,
<span class="add">wherein</span> thou trustedst,
<span class="add">they wearied thee,</span> then how wilt thou do in the swelling of Jordan?
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C12V6">&nbsp;</a>For even thy brethren, and the house of thy father, even they have dealt treacherously with thee; yea,
they have called a multitude after thee: believe them not, though they speak fair words unto thee.

<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C12V7">&nbsp;</a>I have forsaken mine house, I have left mine heritage; I have given the dearly beloved of my soul into
the hand of her enemies.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C12V8">&nbsp;</a>Mine heritage is unto me as a lion in the forest; it crieth out against me: therefore have I hated it.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C12V9">&nbsp;</a>Mine heritage
<span class="add">is</span> unto me
<span class="add">as</span> a speckled bird, the birds round about
<span class="add">are</span> against her; come ye, assemble all the beasts of the field, come to devour.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C12V10">&nbsp;</a>Many pastors have destroyed my vineyard, they have trodden my portion under foot, they have made my pleasant
portion a desolate wilderness.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C12V11">&nbsp;</a>They have made it desolate,
<span class="add">and being</span> desolate it mourneth unto me; the whole land is made desolate, because no man layeth
<span class="add">it</span> to heart.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C12V12">&nbsp;</a>The spoilers are come upon all high places through the wilderness: for the sword of the LORD shall devour
from the
<span class="add">one</span> end of the land even to the
<span class="add">other</span> end of the land: no flesh shall have peace.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C12V13">&nbsp;</a>They have sown wheat, but shall reap thorns: they have put themselves to pain,
<span class="add">but</span> shall not profit: and they shall be ashamed of your revenues because of the fierce anger of the LORD.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C12V14">&nbsp;</a>Thus saith the LORD against all mine evil neighbours, that touch the inheritance which I have caused
my people Israel to inherit; Behold, I will pluck them out of their land, and pluck out the house of
Judah from among them.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C12V15">&nbsp;</a>And it shall come to pass, after that I have plucked them out I will return, and have compassion on them,
and will bring them again, every man to his heritage, and every man to his land.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C12V16">&nbsp;</a>And it shall come to pass, if they will diligently learn the ways of my people, to swear by my name,
The LORD liveth; as they taught my people to swear by Baal; then shall they be built in the midst of
my people.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C12V17">&nbsp;</a>But if they will not obey, I will utterly pluck up and destroy that nation, saith the LORD.
