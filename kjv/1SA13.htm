 <span class="verse" id="V1">1&nbsp;</span>Saul reigned one year; and when he had reigned two years over Israel,  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span>Saul chose him three thousand <span class='add'>men</span> of Israel; <span class='add'>whereof</span> two thousand were with Saul in Michmash and in mount Beth-el, and a thousand were with Jonathan in Gibeah of Benjamin: and the rest of the people he sent every man to his tent.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>And Jonathan smote the garrison of the Philistines that <span class='add'>was</span> in Geba, and the Philistines heard <span class='add'>of it</span>. And Saul blew the trumpet throughout all the land, saying, Let the Hebrews hear.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>And all Israel heard say <span class='add'>that</span> Saul had smitten a garrison of the Philistines, and <span class='add'>that</span> Israel also was had in abomination with the Philistines. And the people were called together after Saul to Gilgal. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>And the Philistines gathered themselves together to fight with Israel, thirty thousand chariots, and six thousand horsemen, and people as the sand which <span class='add'>is</span> on the sea shore in multitude: and they came up, and pitched in Michmash, eastward from Beth-aven.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>When the men of Israel saw that they were in a strait, (for the people were distressed,) then the people did hide themselves in caves, and in thickets, and in rocks, and in high places, and in pits.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>And <span class='add'>some of</span> the Hebrews went over Jordan to the land of Gad and Gilead. As for Saul, he <span class='add'>was</span> yet in Gilgal, and all the people followed him trembling. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>And he tarried seven days, according to the set time that Samuel <span class='add'>had appointed:</span> but Samuel came not to Gilgal; and the people were scattered from him.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>And Saul said, Bring hither a burnt offering to me, and peace offerings. And he offered the burnt offering.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>And it came to pass, that as soon as he had made an end of offering the burnt offering, behold, Samuel came; and Saul went out to meet him, that he might salute him. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>And Samuel said, What hast thou done? And Saul said, Because I saw that the people were scattered from me, and <span class='add'>that</span> thou camest not within the days appointed, and <span class='add'>that</span> the Philistines gathered themselves together at Michmash;  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>Therefore said I, The Philistines will come down now upon me to Gilgal, and I have not made supplication unto the LORD: I forced myself therefore, and offered a burnt offering.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>And Samuel said to Saul, Thou hast done foolishly: thou hast not kept the commandment of the LORD thy God, which he commanded thee: for now would the LORD have established thy kingdom upon Israel for ever.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>But now thy kingdom shall not continue: the LORD hath sought him a man after his own heart, and the LORD hath commanded him <span class='add'>to be</span> captain over his people, because thou hast not kept <span class='add'>that</span> which the LORD commanded thee.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>And Samuel arose, and gat him up from Gilgal unto Gibeah of Benjamin. And Saul numbered the people <span class='add'>that were</span> present with him, about six hundred men.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>And Saul, and Jonathan his son, and the people <span class='add'>that were</span> present with them, abode in Gibeah of Benjamin: but the Philistines encamped in Michmash. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>And the spoilers came out of the camp of the Philistines in three companies: one company turned unto the way <span class='add'>that leadeth to</span> Ophrah, unto the land of Shual:  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>And another company turned the way <span class='add'>to</span> Beth-horon: and another company turned <span class='add'>to</span> the way of the border that looketh to the valley of Zeboim toward the wilderness. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>Now there was no smith found throughout all the land of Israel: for the Philistines said, Lest the Hebrews make <span class='add'>them</span> swords or spears:  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>But all the Israelites went down to the Philistines, to sharpen every man his share, and his coulter, and his axe, and his mattock.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>Yet they had a file for the mattocks, and for the coulters, and for the forks, and for the axes, and to sharpen the goads.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>So it came to pass in the day of battle, that there was neither sword nor spear found in the hand of any of the people that <span class='add'>were</span> with Saul and Jonathan: but with Saul and with Jonathan his son was there found.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>And the garrison of the Philistines went out to the passage of Michmash. </div><ul class='tnav'>
