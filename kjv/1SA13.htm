 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C13V1">&nbsp;</a>Saul reigned one year; and when he had reigned two years over Israel,
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C13V2">&nbsp;</a>Saul chose him three thousand
<span class="add">men</span> of Israel;
<span class="add">whereof</span> two thousand were with Saul in Michmash and in mount Bethel, and a thousand were with Jonathan in Gibeah
of Benjamin: and the rest of the people he sent every man to his tent.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C13V3">&nbsp;</a>And Jonathan smote the garrison of the Philistines that
<span class="add">was</span> in Geba, and the Philistines heard
<span class="add">of it.</span> And Saul blew the trumpet throughout all the land, saying, Let the Hebrews hear.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C13V4">&nbsp;</a>And all Israel heard say
<span class="add">that</span> Saul had smitten a garrison of the Philistines, and
<span class="add">that</span> Israel also was had in abomination with the Philistines. And the people were called together after Saul
to Gilgal.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C13V5">&nbsp;</a>And the Philistines gathered themselves together to fight with Israel, thirty thousand chariots, and
six thousand horsemen, and people as the sand which
<span class="add">is</span> on the sea shore in multitude: and they came up, and pitched in Michmash, eastward from Beth-aven.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C13V6">&nbsp;</a>When the men of Israel saw that they were in a strait, (for the people were distressed,) then the people
did hide themselves in caves, and in thickets, and in rocks, and in high places, and in pits.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C13V7">&nbsp;</a>And
<span class="add">some of</span> the Hebrews went over Jordan to the land of Gad and Gilead. As for Saul, he
<span class="add">was</span> yet in Gilgal, and all the people followed him trembling.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C13V8">&nbsp;</a>And he tarried seven days, according to the set time that Samuel
<span class="add">had appointed:</span> but Samuel came not to Gilgal; and the people were scattered from him.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C13V9">&nbsp;</a>And Saul said, Bring hither a burnt offering to me, and peace offerings. And he offered the burnt offering.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C13V10">&nbsp;</a>And it came to pass, that as soon as he had made an end of offering the burnt offering, behold, Samuel
came; and Saul went out to meet him, that he might salute him.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C13V11">&nbsp;</a>And Samuel said, What hast thou done? And Saul said, Because I saw that the people were scattered from
me, and
<span class="add">that</span> thou camest not within the days appointed, and
<span class="add">that</span> the Philistines gathered themselves together at Michmash;
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C13V12">&nbsp;</a>Therefore said I, The Philistines will come down now upon me to Gilgal, and I have not made supplication
unto the LORD: I forced myself therefore, and offered a burnt offering.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C13V13">&nbsp;</a>And Samuel said to Saul, Thou hast done foolishly: thou hast not kept the commandment of the LORD thy
God, which he commanded thee: for now would the LORD have established thy kingdom upon Israel for ever.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C13V14">&nbsp;</a>But now thy kingdom shall not continue: the LORD hath sought him a man after his own heart, and the LORD
hath commanded him
<span class="add">to be</span> captain over his people, because thou hast not kept
<span class="add">that</span> which the LORD commanded thee.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C13V15">&nbsp;</a>And Samuel arose, and gat him up from Gilgal unto Gibeah of Benjamin. And Saul numbered the people
<span class="add">that were</span> present with him, about six hundred men.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C13V16">&nbsp;</a>And Saul, and Jonathan his son, and the people
<span class="add">that were</span> present with them, abode in Gibeah of Benjamin: but the Philistines encamped in Michmash.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C13V17">&nbsp;</a>And the spoilers came out of the camp of the Philistines in three companies: one company turned unto
the way
<span class="add">that leadeth to</span> Ophrah, unto the land of Shual:
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C13V18">&nbsp;</a>And another company turned the way
<span class="add">to</span> Beth-horon: and another company turned
<span class="add">to</span> the way of the border that looketh to the valley of Zeboim toward the wilderness.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C13V19">&nbsp;</a>Now there was no smith found throughout all the land of Israel: for the Philistines said, Lest the Hebrews
make
<span class="add">them</span> swords or spears:
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C13V20">&nbsp;</a>But all the Israelites went down to the Philistines, to sharpen every man his share, and his coulter,
and his axe, and his mattock.
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C13V21">&nbsp;</a>Yet they had a file for the mattocks, and for the coulters, and for the forks, and for the axes, and
to sharpen the goads.
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C13V22">&nbsp;</a>So it came to pass in the day of battle, that there was neither sword nor spear found in the hand of
any of the people that
<span class="add">were</span> with Saul and Jonathan: but with Saul and with Jonathan his son was there found.
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C13V23">&nbsp;</a>And the garrison of the Philistines went out to the passage of Michmash.
