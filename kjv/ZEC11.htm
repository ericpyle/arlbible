 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C11V1">&nbsp;</a>Open thy doors, O Lebanon, that the fire may devour thy cedars.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C11V2">&nbsp;</a>Howl, fir tree; for the cedar is fallen; because the mighty are spoiled: howl, O ye oaks of Bashan; for
the forest of the vintage is come down.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C11V3">&nbsp;</a><span class="add">There is</span> a voice of the howling of the shepherds; for their glory is spoiled: a voice of the roaring of young
lions; for the pride of Jordan is spoiled.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C11V4">&nbsp;</a>Thus saith the LORD my God; Feed the flock of the slaughter;
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C11V5">&nbsp;</a>Whose possessors slay them, and hold themselves not guilty: and they that sell them say, Blessed
<span class="add">be</span> the LORD; for I am rich: and their own shepherds pity them not.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C11V6">&nbsp;</a>For I will no more pity the inhabitants of the land, saith the LORD: but, lo, I will deliver the men
every one into his neighbour’s hand, and into the hand of his king: and they shall smite the land, and
out of their hand I will not deliver
<span class="add">them.
</span> <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C11V7">&nbsp;</a>And I will feed the flock of slaughter,
<span class="add">even</span> you, O poor of the flock. And I took unto me two staves; the one I called Beauty, and the other I called
Bands; and I fed the flock.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C11V8">&nbsp;</a>Three shepherds also I cut off in one month; and my soul lothed them, and their soul also abhorred me.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C11V9">&nbsp;</a>Then said I, I will not feed you: that that dieth, let it die; and that that is to be cut off, let it
be cut off; and let the rest eat every one the flesh of another.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C11V10">&nbsp;</a>And I took my staff,
<span class="add">even</span> Beauty, and cut it asunder, that I might break my covenant which I had made with all the people.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C11V11">&nbsp;</a>And it was broken in that day: and so the poor of the flock that waited upon me knew that it
<span class="add">was</span> the word of the LORD.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C11V12">&nbsp;</a>And I said unto them, If ye think good, give
<span class="add">me</span> my price; and if not, forbear. So they weighed for my price thirty
<span class="add">pieces</span> of silver.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C11V13">&nbsp;</a>And the LORD said unto me, Cast it unto the potter: a goodly price that I was prised at of them. And
I took the thirty
<span class="add">pieces</span> of silver, and cast them to the potter in the house of the LORD.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C11V14">&nbsp;</a>Then I cut asunder mine other staff,
<span class="add">even</span> Bands, that I might break the brotherhood between Judah and Israel.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C11V15">&nbsp;</a>And the LORD said unto me, Take unto thee yet the instruments of a foolish shepherd.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C11V16">&nbsp;</a>For, lo, I will raise up a shepherd in the land,
<span class="add">which</span> shall not visit those that be cut off, neither shall seek the young one, nor heal that that is broken,
nor feed that that standeth still: but he shall eat the flesh of the fat, and tear their claws in pieces.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C11V17">&nbsp;</a>Woe to the idol shepherd that leaveth the flock! the sword
<span class="add">shall be</span> upon his arm, and upon his right eye: his arm shall be clean dried up, and his right eye shall be utterly
darkened.
