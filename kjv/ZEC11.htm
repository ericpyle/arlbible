 <span class="verse" id="V1">1&nbsp;</span>Open thy doors, O Lebanon, that the fire may devour thy cedars.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span>Howl, fir tree; for the cedar is fallen; because the mighty are spoiled: howl, O ye oaks of Bashan; for the forest of the vintage is come down. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span> <span class='add'>There is</span> a voice of the howling of the shepherds; for their glory is spoiled: a voice of the roaring of young lions; for the pride of Jordan is spoiled.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>Thus saith the LORD my God; Feed the flock of the slaughter;  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>Whose possessors slay them, and hold themselves not guilty: and they that sell them say, Blessed <span class='add'>be</span> the LORD; for I am rich: and their own shepherds pity them not.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>For I will no more pity the inhabitants of the land, saith the LORD: but, lo, I will deliver the men every one into his neighbour’s hand, and into the hand of his king: and they shall smite the land, and out of their hand I will not deliver <span class='add'>them</span>.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>And I will feed the flock of slaughter, <span class='add'>even</span> you, O poor of the flock. And I took unto me two staves; the one I called Beauty, and the other I called Bands; and I fed the flock.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>Three shepherds also I cut off in one month; and my soul lothed them, and their soul also abhorred me.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>Then said I, I will not feed you: that that dieth, let it die; and that that is to be cut off, let it be cut off; and let the rest eat every one the flesh of another. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>And I took my staff, <span class='add'>even</span> Beauty, and cut it asunder, that I might break my covenant which I had made with all the people.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>And it was broken in that day: and so the poor of the flock that waited upon me knew that it <span class='add'>was</span> the word of the LORD.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>And I said unto them, If ye think good, give <span class='add'>me</span> my price; and if not, forbear. So they weighed for my price thirty <span class='add'>pieces</span> of silver.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>And the LORD said unto me, Cast it unto the potter: a goodly price that I was prised at of them. And I took the thirty <span class='add'>pieces</span> of silver, and cast them to the potter in the house of the LORD.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>Then I cut asunder mine other staff, <span class='add'>even</span> Bands, that I might break the brotherhood between Judah and Israel. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>And the LORD said unto me, Take unto thee yet the instruments of a foolish shepherd.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>For, lo, I will raise up a shepherd in the land, <span class='add'>which</span> shall not visit those that be cut off, neither shall seek the young one, nor heal that that is broken, nor feed that that standeth still: but he shall eat the flesh of the fat, and tear their claws in pieces.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>Woe to the idol shepherd that leaveth the flock! the sword <span class='add'>shall be</span> upon his arm, and upon his right eye: his arm shall be clean dried up, and his right eye shall be utterly darkened. </div><ul class='tnav'>
