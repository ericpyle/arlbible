<div class="chapterlabel"> 14</div><div class="p">
 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C14V1">&nbsp;</a>Again, one preparing himself to sail, and about to pass through the raging waves, calleth upon a piece
of wood more rotten than the vessel that carrieth him.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C14V2">&nbsp;</a>For verily desire of gain devised that, and the workman built it by his skill.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C14V3">&nbsp;</a>But thy providence, O Father, governeth it: for thou hast made a way in the sea, and a safe path in the
waves;
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C14V4">&nbsp;</a>Shewing that thou canst save from all danger: yea, though a man went to sea without art.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C14V5">&nbsp;</a>Nevertheless thou wouldest not that the works of thy wisdom should be idle, and therefore do men commit
their lives to a small piece of wood, and passing the rough sea in a weak vessel are saved.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C14V6">&nbsp;</a>For in the old time also, when the proud giants perished, the hope of the world governed by thy hand
escaped in a weak vessel, and left to all ages a seed of generation.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C14V7">&nbsp;</a>For blessed is the wood whereby righteousness cometh.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C14V8">&nbsp;</a>But that which is made with hands is cursed, as well it, as he that made it: he, because he made it;
and it, because, being corruptible, it was called god.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C14V9">&nbsp;</a>For the ungodly and his ungodliness are both alike hateful unto God.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C14V10">&nbsp;</a>For that which is made shall be punished together with him that made it.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C14V11">&nbsp;</a>Therefore even upon the idols of the Gentiles shall there be a visitation: because in the creature of
God they are become an abomination, and stumblingblocks to the souls of men, and a snare to the feet
of the unwise.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C14V12">&nbsp;</a>For the devising of idols was the beginning of spiritual fornication, and the invention of them the corruption
of life.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C14V13">&nbsp;</a>For neither were they from the beginning, neither shall they be for ever.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C14V14">&nbsp;</a>For by the vain glory of men they entered into the world, and therefore shall they come shortly to an
end.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C14V15">&nbsp;</a>For a father afflicted with untimely mourning, when he hath made an image of his child soon taken away,
now honoured him as a god, which was then a dead man, and delivered to those that were under him ceremonies
and sacrifices.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C14V16">&nbsp;</a>Thus in process of time an ungodly custom grown strong was kept as a law, and graven images were worshipped
by the commandments of kings.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C14V17">&nbsp;</a>Whom men could not honour in presence, because they dwelt far off, they took the counterfeit of his visage
from far, and made an express image of a king whom they honoured, to the end that by this their forwardness
they might flatter him that was absent, as if he were present.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C14V18">&nbsp;</a>Also the singular diligence of the artificer did help to set forward the ignorant to more superstition.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C14V19">&nbsp;</a>For he, peradventure willing to please one in authority, forced all his skill to make the resemblance
of the best fashion.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C14V20">&nbsp;</a>And so the multitude, allured by the grace of the work, took him now for a god, which a little before
was but honoured.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C14V21">&nbsp;</a>And this was an occasion to deceive the world: for men, serving either calamity or tyranny, did ascribe
unto stones and stocks the incommunicable name.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C14V22">&nbsp;</a>Moreover this was not enough for them, that they erred in the knowledge of God; but whereas they lived
in the great war of ignorance, those so great plagues called they peace.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C14V23">&nbsp;</a>For whilst they slew their children in sacrifices, or used secret ceremonies, or made revellings of strange
rites;
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C14V24">&nbsp;</a>They kept neither lives nor marriages any longer undefiled: but either one slew another traiterously,
or grieved him by adultery.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C14V25">&nbsp;</a>So that there reigned in all men without exception blood, manslaughter, theft, and dissimulation, corruption,
unfaithfulness, tumults, perjury,
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C14V26">&nbsp;</a>Disquieting of good men, forgetfulness of good turns, defiling of souls, changing of kind, disorder in
marriages, adultery, and shameless uncleanness.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C14V27">&nbsp;</a>For the worshipping of idols not to be named is the beginning, the cause, and the end, of all evil.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C14V28">&nbsp;</a>For either they are mad when they be merry, or prophesy lies, or live unjustly, or else lightly forswear
themselves.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C14V29">&nbsp;</a>For insomuch as their trust is in idols, which have no life; though they swear falsely, yet they look
not to be hurt.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 30</span><a name="C14V30">&nbsp;</a>Howbeit for both causes shall they be justly punished: both because they thought not well of God, giving
heed unto idols, and also unjustly swore in deceit, despising holiness.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 31</span><a name="C14V31">&nbsp;</a>For it is not the power of them by whom they swear: but it is the just vengeance of sinners, that punisheth
always the offence of the ungodly.
