 <span class="verse" id="V1">1&nbsp;</span>Again, one preparing himself to sail, and about to pass through the raging waves, calleth upon a piece of wood more rotten than the vessel that carrieth him. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span>For verily desire of gain devised that, and the workman built it by his skill. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>But thy providence, O Father, governeth it: for thou hast made a way in the sea, and a safe path in the waves; </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>Shewing that thou canst save from all danger: yea, though a man went to sea without art. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>Nevertheless thou wouldest not that the works of thy wisdom should be idle, and therefore do men commit their lives to a small piece of wood, and passing the rough sea in a weak vessel are saved. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>For in the old time also, when the proud giants perished, the hope of the world governed by thy hand escaped in a weak vessel, and left to all ages a seed of generation. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>For blessed is the wood whereby righteousness cometh. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>But that which is made with hands is cursed, as well it, as he that made it: he, because he made it; and it, because, being corruptible, it was called god. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>For the ungodly and his ungodliness are both alike hateful unto God. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>For that which is made shall be punished together with him that made it. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>Therefore even upon the idols of the Gentiles shall there be a visitation: because in the creature of God they are become an abomination, and stumblingblocks to the souls of men, and a snare to the feet of the unwise. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>For the devising of idols was the beginning of spiritual fornication, and the invention of them the corruption of life. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>For neither were they from the beginning, neither shall they be for ever. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>For by the vain glory of men they entered into the world, and therefore shall they come shortly to an end. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>For a father afflicted with untimely mourning, when he hath made an image of his child soon taken away, now honoured him as a god, which was then a dead man, and delivered to those that were under him ceremonies and sacrifices. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>Thus in process of time an ungodly custom grown strong was kept as a law, and graven images were worshipped by the commandments of kings. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>Whom men could not honour in presence, because they dwelt far off, they took the counterfeit of his visage from far, and made an express image of a king whom they honoured, to the end that by this their forwardness they might flatter him that was absent, as if he were present. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>Also the singular diligence of the artificer did help to set forward the ignorant to more superstition. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>For he, peradventure willing to please one in authority, forced all his skill to make the resemblance of the best fashion. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>And so the multitude, allured by the grace of the work, took him now for a god, which a little before was but honoured. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>And this was an occasion to deceive the world: for men, serving either calamity or tyranny, did ascribe unto stones and stocks the incommunicable name. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>Moreover this was not enough for them, that they erred in the knowledge of God; but whereas they lived in the great war of ignorance, those so great plagues called they peace. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>For whilst they slew their children in sacrifices, or used secret ceremonies, or made revellings of strange rites; </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>They kept neither lives nor marriages any longer undefiled: but either one slew another traiterously, or grieved him by adultery. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>So that there reigned in all men without exception blood, manslaughter, theft, and dissimulation, corruption, unfaithfulness, tumults, perjury, </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>Disquieting of good men, forgetfulness of good turns, defiling of souls, changing of kind, disorder in marriages, adultery, and shameless uncleanness. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>For the worshipping of idols not to be named is the beginning, the cause, and the end, of all evil. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V28">28&nbsp;</span>For either they are mad when they be merry, or prophesy lies, or live unjustly, or else lightly forswear themselves. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V29">29&nbsp;</span>For insomuch as their trust is in idols, which have no life; though they swear falsely, yet they look not to be hurt. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V30">30&nbsp;</span>Howbeit for both causes shall they be justly punished: both because they thought not well of God, giving heed unto idols, and also unjustly swore in deceit, despising holiness. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V31">31&nbsp;</span>For it is not the power of them by whom they swear: but it is the just vengeance of sinners, that punisheth always the offence of the ungodly. </div><ul class='tnav'>
