<div class="chapterlabel"> 12</div><div class="p">
 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C12V1">&nbsp;</a>The word of the LORD also came unto me, saying,
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C12V2">&nbsp;</a>Son of man, thou dwellest in the midst of a rebellious house, which have eyes to see, and see not; they
have ears to hear, and hear not: for they
<span class="add">are</span> a rebellious house.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C12V3">&nbsp;</a>Therefore, thou son of man, prepare thee stuff for removing, and remove by day in their sight; and thou
shalt remove from thy place to another place in their sight: it may be they will consider, though they
<span class="add">be</span> a rebellious house.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C12V4">&nbsp;</a>Then shalt thou bring forth thy stuff by day in their sight, as stuff for removing: and thou shalt go
forth at even in their sight, as they that go forth into captivity.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C12V5">&nbsp;</a>Dig thou through the wall in their sight, and carry out thereby.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C12V6">&nbsp;</a>In their sight shalt thou bear
<span class="add">it</span> upon
<span class="add">thy</span> shoulders,
<span class="add">and</span> carry
<span class="add">it</span> forth in the twilight: thou shalt cover thy face, that thou see not the ground: for I have set thee
<span class="add">for</span> a sign unto the house of Israel.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C12V7">&nbsp;</a>And I did so as I was commanded: I brought forth my stuff by day, as stuff for captivity, and in the
even I digged through the wall with mine hand; I brought
<span class="add">it</span> forth in the twilight,
<span class="add">and</span> I bare
<span class="add">it</span> upon
<span class="add">my</span> shoulder in their sight.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C12V8">&nbsp;</a>And in the morning came the word of the LORD unto me, saying,
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C12V9">&nbsp;</a>Son of man, hath not the house of Israel, the rebellious house, said unto thee, What doest thou?
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C12V10">&nbsp;</a>Say thou unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; This burden
<span class="add">concerneth</span> the prince in Jerusalem, and all the house of Israel that
<span class="add">are</span> among them.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C12V11">&nbsp;</a>Say, I
<span class="add">am</span> your sign: like as I have done, so shall it be done unto them: they shall remove
<span class="add">and</span> go into captivity.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C12V12">&nbsp;</a>And the prince that
<span class="add">is</span> among them shall bear upon
<span class="add">his</span> shoulder in the twilight, and shall go forth: they shall dig through the wall to carry out thereby:
he shall cover his face, that he see not the ground with
<span class="add">his</span> eyes.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C12V13">&nbsp;</a>My net also will I spread upon him, and he shall be taken in my snare: and I will bring him to Babylon
<span class="add">to</span> the land of the Chaldeans; yet shall he not see it, though he shall die there.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C12V14">&nbsp;</a>And I will scatter toward every wind all that
<span class="add">are</span> about him to help him, and all his bands; and I will draw out the sword after them.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C12V15">&nbsp;</a>And they shall know that I
<span class="add">am</span> the LORD, when I shall scatter them among the nations, and disperse them in the countries.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C12V16">&nbsp;</a>But I will leave a few men of them from the sword, from the famine, and from the pestilence; that they
may declare all their abominations among the heathen whither they come; and they shall know that I
<span class="add">am</span> the LORD.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C12V17">&nbsp;</a>Moreover the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C12V18">&nbsp;</a>Son of man, eat thy bread with quaking, and drink thy water with trembling and with carefulness;
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C12V19">&nbsp;</a>And say unto the people of the land, Thus saith the Lord GOD of the inhabitants of Jerusalem,
<span class="add">and</span> of the land of Israel; They shall eat their bread with carefulness, and drink their water with astonishment,
that her land may be desolate from all that is therein, because of the violence of all them that dwell
therein.
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C12V20">&nbsp;</a>And the cities that are inhabited shall be laid waste, and the land shall be desolate; and ye shall know
that I
<span class="add">am</span> the LORD.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C12V21">&nbsp;</a>And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C12V22">&nbsp;</a>Son of man, what
<span class="add">is</span> that proverb
<span class="add">that</span> ye have in the land of Israel, saying, The days are prolonged, and every vision faileth?
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C12V23">&nbsp;</a>Tell them therefore, Thus saith the Lord GOD; I will make this proverb to cease, and they shall no more
use it as a proverb in Israel; but say unto them, The days are at hand, and the effect of every vision.
 <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C12V24">&nbsp;</a>For there shall be no more any vain vision nor flattering divination within the house of Israel.
 <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C12V25">&nbsp;</a>For I
<span class="add">am</span> the LORD: I will speak, and the word that I shall speak shall come to pass; it shall be no more prolonged:
for in your days, O rebellious house, will I say the word, and will perform it, saith the Lord GOD.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C12V26">&nbsp;</a>Again the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
 <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C12V27">&nbsp;</a>Son of man, behold,
<span class="add">they of</span> the house of Israel say, The vision that he seeth
<span class="add">is</span> for many days
<span class="add">to come,</span> and he prophesieth of the times
<span class="add">that are</span> far off.
 <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C12V28">&nbsp;</a>Therefore say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; There shall none of my words be prolonged any more,
but the word which I have spoken shall be done, saith the Lord GOD.
