 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C23V1">&nbsp;</a>So when David was old and full of days, he made Solomon his son king over Israel.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C23V2">&nbsp;</a>And he gathered together all the princes of Israel, with the priests and the Levites.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C23V3">&nbsp;</a>Now the Levites were numbered from the age of thirty years and upward: and their number by their polls,
man by man, was thirty and eight thousand.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C23V4">&nbsp;</a>Of which, twenty and four thousand
<span class="add">were</span> to set forward the work of the house of the LORD; and six thousand
<span class="add">were</span> officers and judges:
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C23V5">&nbsp;</a>Moreover four thousand
<span class="add">were</span> porters; and four thousand praised the LORD with the instruments which I made,
<span class="add">said David,</span> to praise
<span class="add">therewith.
</span> <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C23V6">&nbsp;</a>And David divided them into courses among the sons of Levi,
<span class="add">namely,
</span> Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C23V7">&nbsp;</a>Of the Gershonites
<span class="add">were,</span> Laadan, and Shimei.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C23V8">&nbsp;</a>The sons of Laadan; the chief
<span class="add">was</span> Jehiel, and Zetham, and Joel, three.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C23V9">&nbsp;</a>The sons of Shimei; Shelomith, and Haziel, and Haran, three. These
<span class="add">were</span> the chief of the fathers of Laadan.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C23V10">&nbsp;</a>And the sons of Shimei
<span class="add">were,</span> Jahath, Zina, and Jeush, and Beriah. These four
<span class="add">were</span> the sons of Shimei.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C23V11">&nbsp;</a>And Jahath was the chief, and Zizah the second: but Jeush and Beriah had not many sons; therefore they
were in one reckoning, according to
<span class="add">their
</span> father’s house.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C23V12">&nbsp;</a>The sons of Kohath; Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel, four.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C23V13">&nbsp;</a>The sons of Amram; Aaron and Moses: and Aaron was separated, that he should sanctify the most holy things,
he and his sons for ever, to burn incense before the LORD, to minister unto him, and to bless in his
name for ever.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C23V14">&nbsp;</a>Now
<span class="add">concerning</span> Moses the man of God, his sons were named of the tribe of Levi.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C23V15">&nbsp;</a>The sons of Moses
<span class="add">were,</span> Gershom, and Eliezer.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C23V16">&nbsp;</a>Of the sons of Gershom, Shebuel
<span class="add">was</span> the chief.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C23V17">&nbsp;</a>And the sons of Eliezer
<span class="add">were,</span> Rehabiah the chief. And Eliezer had none other sons; but the sons of Rehabiah were very many.
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C23V18">&nbsp;</a>Of the sons of Izhar; Shelomith the chief.
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C23V19">&nbsp;</a>Of the sons of Hebron; Jeriah the first, Amariah the second, Jahaziel the third, and Jekameam the fourth.
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C23V20">&nbsp;</a>Of the sons of Uzziel; Micah the first, and Jesiah the second.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C23V21">&nbsp;</a>The sons of Merari; Mahli, and Mushi. The sons of Mahli; Eleazar, and Kish.
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C23V22">&nbsp;</a>And Eleazar died, and had no sons, but daughters: and their brethren the sons of Kish took them.
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C23V23">&nbsp;</a>The sons of Mushi; Mahli, and Eder, and Jeremoth, three.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C23V24">&nbsp;</a>These
<span class="add">were</span> the sons of Levi after the house of their fathers;
<span class="add">even</span> the chief of the fathers, as they were counted by number of names by their polls, that did the work
for the service of the house of the LORD, from the age of twenty years and upward.
 <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C23V25">&nbsp;</a>For David said, The LORD God of Israel hath given rest unto his people, that they may dwell in Jerusalem
for ever:
 <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C23V26">&nbsp;</a>And also unto the Levites; they shall no
<span class="add">more</span> carry the tabernacle, nor any vessels of it for the service thereof.
 <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C23V27">&nbsp;</a>For by the last words of David the Levites
<span class="add">were</span> numbered from twenty years old and above:
 <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C23V28">&nbsp;</a>Because their office
<span class="add">was</span> to wait on the sons of Aaron for the service of the house of the LORD, in the courts, and in the chambers,
and in the purifying of all holy things, and the work of the service of the house of God;
 <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C23V29">&nbsp;</a>Both for the shewbread, and for the fine flour for meat offering, and for the unleavened cakes, and for
<span class="add">that which is baked in</span> the pan, and for that which is fried, and for all manner of measure and size;
 <span class="verse"> 30</span><a name="C23V30">&nbsp;</a>And to stand every morning to thank and praise the LORD, and likewise at even;
 <span class="verse"> 31</span><a name="C23V31">&nbsp;</a>And to offer all burnt sacrifices unto the LORD in the sabbaths, in the new moons, and on the set feasts,
by number, according to the order commanded unto them, continually before the LORD:
 <span class="verse"> 32</span><a name="C23V32">&nbsp;</a>And that they should keep the charge of the tabernacle of the congregation, and the charge of the holy
<span class="add">place,</span> and the charge of the sons of Aaron their brethren, in the service of the house of the LORD.
