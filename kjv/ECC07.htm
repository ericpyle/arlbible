<div class="chapterlabel"> 7</div><div class="p">
 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C7V1">&nbsp;</a>A good name
<span class="add">is</span> better than precious ointment; and the day of death than the day of one’s birth.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C7V2">&nbsp;</a><span class="add">It is</span> better to go to the house of mourning, than to go to the house of feasting: for that is the end of all
men; and the living will lay
<span class="add">it</span> to his heart.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C7V3">&nbsp;</a>Sorrow
<span class="add">is</span> better than laughter: for by the sadness of the countenance the heart is made better.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C7V4">&nbsp;</a>The heart of the wise
<span class="add">is</span> in the house of mourning; but the heart of fools
<span class="add">is</span> in the house of mirth.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C7V5">&nbsp;</a><span class="add">It is</span> better to hear the rebuke of the wise, than for a man to hear the song of fools.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C7V6">&nbsp;</a>For as the crackling of thorns under a pot, so
<span class="add">is</span> the laughter of the fool: this also
<span class="add">is</span> vanity.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C7V7">&nbsp;</a>Surely oppression maketh a wise man mad; and a gift destroyeth the heart.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C7V8">&nbsp;</a>Better
<span class="add">is</span> the end of a thing than the beginning thereof:
<span class="add">and</span> the patient in spirit
<span class="add">is</span> better than the proud in spirit.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C7V9">&nbsp;</a>Be not hasty in thy spirit to be angry: for anger resteth in the bosom of fools.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C7V10">&nbsp;</a>Say not thou, What is
<span class="add">the cause</span> that the former days were better than these? for thou dost not enquire wisely concerning this.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C7V11">&nbsp;</a>Wisdom
<span class="add">is</span> good with an inheritance: and
<span class="add">by it there is
</span> profit to them that see the sun.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C7V12">&nbsp;</a>For wisdom
<span class="add">is</span> a defence,
<span class="add">and</span> money
<span class="add">is
</span> a defence: but the excellency of knowledge
<span class="add">is, that</span> wisdom giveth life to them that have it.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C7V13">&nbsp;</a>Consider the work of God: for who can make
<span class="add">that</span> straight, which he hath made crooked?
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C7V14">&nbsp;</a>In the day of prosperity be joyful, but in the day of adversity consider: God also hath set the one over
against the other, to the end that man should find nothing after him.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C7V15">&nbsp;</a>All
<span class="add">things</span> have I seen in the days of my vanity: there is a just
<span class="add">man</span> that perisheth in his righteousness, and there is a wicked
<span class="add">man</span> that prolongeth
<span class="add">his life</span> in his wickedness.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C7V16">&nbsp;</a>Be not righteous over much; neither make thyself over wise: why shouldest thou destroy thyself?
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C7V17">&nbsp;</a>Be not over much wicked, neither be thou foolish: why shouldest thou die before thy time?
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C7V18">&nbsp;</a><span class="add">It is</span> good that thou shouldest take hold of this; yea, also from this withdraw not thine hand: for he that
feareth God shall come forth of them all.
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C7V19">&nbsp;</a>Wisdom strengtheneth the wise more than ten mighty
<span class="add">men</span> which are in the city.
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C7V20">&nbsp;</a>For
<span class="add">there is</span> not a just man upon earth, that doeth good, and sinneth not.
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C7V21">&nbsp;</a>Also take no heed unto all words that are spoken; lest thou hear thy servant curse thee:
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C7V22">&nbsp;</a>For oftentimes also thine own heart knoweth that thou thyself likewise hast cursed others.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C7V23">&nbsp;</a>All this have I proved by wisdom: I said, I will be wise; but it
<span class="add">was</span> far from me.
 <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C7V24">&nbsp;</a>That which is far off, and exceeding deep, who can find it out?
 <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C7V25">&nbsp;</a>I applied mine heart to know, and to search, and to seek out wisdom, and the reason
<span class="add">of things,</span> and to know the wickedness of folly, even of foolishness
<span class="add">and</span> madness:
 <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C7V26">&nbsp;</a>And I find more bitter than death the woman, whose heart
<span class="add">is
</span> snares and nets,
<span class="add">and</span> her hands
<span class="add">as</span> bands: whoso pleaseth God shall escape from her; but the sinner shall be taken by her.
 <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C7V27">&nbsp;</a>Behold, this have I found, saith the preacher,
<span class="add">counting</span> one by one, to find out the account:
 <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C7V28">&nbsp;</a>Which yet my soul seeketh, but I find not: one man among a thousand have I found; but a woman among all
those have I not found.
 <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C7V29">&nbsp;</a>Lo, this only have I found, that God hath made man upright; but they have sought out many inventions.
