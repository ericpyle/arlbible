 <span class="verse" id="V1">1&nbsp;</span>And it came to pass, when king Hezekiah heard <span class='add'>it</span>, that he rent his clothes, and covered himself with sackcloth, and went into the house of the LORD.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span>And he sent Eliakim, who <span class='add'>was</span> over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and the elders of the priests covered with sackcloth, unto Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>And they said unto him, Thus saith Hezekiah, This day <span class='add'>is</span> a day of trouble, and of rebuke, and of blasphemy: for the children are come to the birth, and <span class='add'>there is</span> not strength to bring forth.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>It may be the LORD thy God will hear the words of Rabshakeh, whom the king of Assyria his master hath sent to reproach the living God, and will reprove the words which the LORD thy God hath heard: wherefore lift up <span class='add'>thy</span> prayer for the remnant that is left.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>So the servants of king Hezekiah came to Isaiah. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>And Isaiah said unto them, Thus shall ye say unto your master, Thus saith the LORD, Be not afraid of the words that thou hast heard, wherewith the servants of the king of Assyria have blasphemed me.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>Behold, I will send a blast upon him, and he shall hear a rumour, and return to his own land; and I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>So Rabshakeh returned, and found the king of Assyria warring against Libnah: for he had heard that he was departed from Lachish.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>And he heard say concerning Tirhakah king of Ethiopia, He is come forth to make war with thee. And when he heard <span class='add'>it</span>, he sent messengers to Hezekiah, saying,  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>Thus shall ye speak to Hezekiah king of Judah, saying, Let not thy God, in whom thou trustest, deceive thee, saying, Jerusalem shall not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>Behold, thou hast heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all lands by destroying them utterly; and shalt thou be delivered?
