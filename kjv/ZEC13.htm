 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C13V1">&nbsp;</a>In that day there shall be a fountain opened to the house of David and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem
for sin and for uncleanness.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C13V2">&nbsp;</a>And it shall come to pass in that day, saith the LORD of hosts,
<span class="add">that</span> I will cut off the names of the idols out of the land, and they shall no more be remembered: and also
I will cause the prophets and the unclean spirit to pass out of the land.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C13V3">&nbsp;</a>And it shall come to pass,
<span class="add">that</span> when any shall yet prophesy, then his father and his mother that begat him shall say unto him, Thou
shalt not live; for thou speakest lies in the name of the LORD: and his father and his mother that begat
him shall thrust him through when he prophesieth.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C13V4">&nbsp;</a>And it shall come to pass in that day,
<span class="add">that</span> the prophets shall be ashamed every one of his vision, when he hath prophesied; neither shall they wear
a rough garment to deceive:
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C13V5">&nbsp;</a>But he shall say, I
<span class="add">am</span> no prophet, I
<span class="add">am</span> an husbandman; for man taught me to keep cattle from my youth.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C13V6">&nbsp;</a>And
<span class="add">one</span> shall say unto him, What
<span class="add">are</span> these wounds in thine hands? Then he shall answer,
<span class="add">Those</span> with which I was wounded
<span class="add">in</span> the house of my friends.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C13V7">&nbsp;</a>Awake, O sword, against my shepherd, and against the man
<span class="add">that is
</span> my fellow, saith the LORD of hosts: smite the shepherd, and the sheep shall be scattered: and I will
turn mine hand upon the little ones.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C13V8">&nbsp;</a>And it shall come to pass,
<span class="add">that</span> in all the land, saith the LORD, two parts therein shall be cut off
<span class="add">and</span> die; but the third shall be left therein.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C13V9">&nbsp;</a>And I will bring the third part through the fire, and will refine them as silver is refined, and will
try them as gold is tried: they shall call on my name, and I will hear them: I will say, It
<span class="add">is</span> my people: and they shall say, The LORD
<span class="add">is</span> my God.
