 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C2V1">&nbsp;</a>How hath the Lord covered the daughter of Zion with a cloud in his anger,
<span class="add">and</span> cast down from heaven unto the earth the beauty of Israel, and remembered not his footstool in the day
of his anger!
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C2V2">&nbsp;</a>The Lord hath swallowed up all the habitations of Jacob, and hath not pitied: he hath thrown down in
his wrath the strong holds of the daughter of Judah; he hath brought
<span class="add">them</span> down to the ground: he hath polluted the kingdom and the princes thereof.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C2V3">&nbsp;</a>He hath cut off in
<span class="add">his</span> fierce anger all the horn of Israel: he hath drawn back his right hand from before the enemy, and he
burned against Jacob like a flaming fire,
<span class="add">which</span> devoureth round about.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C2V4">&nbsp;</a>He hath bent his bow like an enemy: he stood with his right hand as an adversary, and slew all
<span class="add">that were</span> pleasant to the eye in the tabernacle of the daughter of Zion: he poured out his fury like fire.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C2V5">&nbsp;</a>The Lord was as an enemy: he hath swallowed up Israel, he hath swallowed up all her palaces: he hath
destroyed his strong holds, and hath increased in the daughter of Judah mourning and lamentation.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C2V6">&nbsp;</a>And he hath violently taken away his tabernacle, as
<span class="add">if it were of</span> a garden: he hath destroyed his places of the assembly: the LORD hath caused the solemn feasts and sabbaths
to be forgotten in Zion, and hath despised in the indignation of his anger the king and the priest.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C2V7">&nbsp;</a>The Lord hath cast off his altar, he hath abhorred his sanctuary, he hath given up into the hand of the
enemy the walls of her palaces; they have made a noise in the house of the LORD, as in the day of a solemn
feast.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C2V8">&nbsp;</a>The LORD hath purposed to destroy the wall of the daughter of Zion: he hath stretched out a line, he
hath not withdrawn his hand from destroying: therefore he made the rampart and the wall to lament; they
languished together.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C2V9">&nbsp;</a>Her gates are sunk into the ground; he hath destroyed and broken her bars: her king and her princes
<span class="add">are</span> among the Gentiles: the law
<span class="add">is</span> no
<span class="add">more;</span> her prophets also find no vision from the LORD.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C2V10">&nbsp;</a>The elders of the daughter of Zion sit upon the ground,
<span class="add">and</span> keep silence: they have cast up dust upon their heads; they have girded themselves with sackcloth: the
virgins of Jerusalem hang down their heads to the ground.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C2V11">&nbsp;</a>Mine eyes do fail with tears, my bowels are troubled, my liver is poured upon the earth, for the destruction
of the daughter of my people; because the children and the sucklings swoon in the streets of the city.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C2V12">&nbsp;</a>They say to their mothers, Where
<span class="add">is</span> corn and wine? when they swooned as the wounded in the streets of the city, when their soul was poured
out into their mothers’ bosom.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C2V13">&nbsp;</a>What thing shall I take to witness for thee? what thing shall I liken to thee, O daughter of Jerusalem?
what shall I equal to thee, that I may comfort thee, O virgin daughter of Zion? for thy breach is great
like the sea: who can heal thee?
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C2V14">&nbsp;</a>Thy prophets have seen vain and foolish things for thee: and they have not discovered thine iniquity,
to turn away thy captivity; but have seen for thee false burdens and causes of banishment.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C2V15">&nbsp;</a>All that pass by clap
<span class="add">their</span> hands at thee; they hiss and wag their head at the daughter of Jerusalem,
<span class="add">saying, Is</span> this the city that
<span class="add">men</span> call The perfection of beauty, The joy of the whole earth?
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C2V16">&nbsp;</a>All thine enemies have opened their mouth against thee: they hiss and gnash the teeth: they say, We have
swallowed
<span class="add">her</span> up: certainly this
<span class="add">is</span> the day that we looked for; we have found, we have seen
<span class="add">it.
</span> <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C2V17">&nbsp;</a>The LORD hath done
<span class="add">that</span> which he had devised; he hath fulfilled his word that he had commanded in the days of old: he hath thrown
down, and hath not pitied: and he hath caused
<span class="add">thine</span> enemy to rejoice over thee, he hath set up the horn of thine adversaries.
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C2V18">&nbsp;</a>Their heart cried unto the Lord, O wall of the daughter of Zion, let tears run down like a river day
and night: give thyself no rest; let not the apple of thine eye cease.
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C2V19">&nbsp;</a>Arise, cry out in the night: in the beginning of the watches pour out thine heart like water before the
face of the Lord: lift up thy hands toward him for the life of thy young children, that faint for hunger
in the top of every street.

<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C2V20">&nbsp;</a>Behold, O LORD, and consider to whom thou hast done this. Shall the women eat their fruit,
<span class="add">and</span> children of a span long? shall the priest and the prophet be slain in the sanctuary of the Lord?
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C2V21">&nbsp;</a>The young and the old lie on the ground in the streets: my virgins and my young men are fallen by the
sword; thou hast slain
<span class="add">them</span> in the day of thine anger; thou hast killed,
<span class="add">and</span> not pitied.
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C2V22">&nbsp;</a>Thou hast called as in a solemn day my terrors round about, so that in the day of the LORD’S anger none
escaped nor remained: those that I have swaddled and brought up hath mine enemy consumed.
