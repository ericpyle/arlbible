 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C1V1">&nbsp;</a>The burden of the word of the LORD to Israel by Malachi.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C1V2">&nbsp;</a>I have loved you, saith the LORD. Yet ye say, Wherein hast thou loved us?
<span class="add">Was</span> not Esau Jacob’s brother? saith the LORD: yet I loved Jacob,
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C1V3">&nbsp;</a>And I hated Esau, and laid his mountains and his heritage waste for the dragons of the wilderness.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C1V4">&nbsp;</a>Whereas Edom saith, We are impoverished, but we will return and build the desolate places; thus saith
the LORD of hosts, They shall build, but I will throw down; and they shall call them, The border of wickedness,
and, The people against whom the LORD hath indignation for ever.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C1V5">&nbsp;</a>And your eyes shall see, and ye shall say, The LORD will be magnified from the border of Israel.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C1V6">&nbsp;</a>A son honoureth
<span class="add">his</span> father, and a servant his master: if then I
<span class="add">be</span> a father, where
<span class="add">is</span> mine honour? and if I
<span class="add">be
</span> a master, where
<span class="add">is</span> my fear? saith the LORD of hosts unto you, O priests, that despise my name. And ye say, Wherein have
we despised thy name?
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C1V7">&nbsp;</a>Ye offer polluted bread upon mine altar; and ye say, Wherein have we polluted thee? In that ye say, The
table of the LORD
<span class="add">is</span> contemptible.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C1V8">&nbsp;</a>And if ye offer the blind for sacrifice,
<span class="add">is it</span> not evil? and if ye offer the lame and sick,
<span class="add">is it</span> not evil? offer it now unto thy governor; will he be pleased with thee, or accept thy person? saith
the LORD of hosts.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C1V9">&nbsp;</a>And now, I pray you, beseech God that he will be gracious unto us: this hath been by your means: will
he regard your persons? saith the LORD of hosts.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C1V10">&nbsp;</a>Who
<span class="add">is there</span> even among you that would shut the doors
<span class="add">for nought?</span> neither do ye kindle
<span class="add">fire</span> on mine altar for nought. I have no pleasure in you, saith the LORD of hosts, neither will I accept
an offering at your hand.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C1V11">&nbsp;</a>For from the rising of the sun even unto the going down of the same my name
<span class="add">shall be</span> great among the Gentiles; and in every place incense
<span class="add">shall be</span> offered unto my name, and a pure offering: for my name
<span class="add">shall be</span> great among the heathen, saith the LORD of hosts.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C1V12">&nbsp;</a>But ye have profaned it, in that ye say, The table of the LORD
<span class="add">is</span> polluted; and the fruit thereof,
<span class="add">even</span> his meat,
<span class="add">is</span> contemptible.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C1V13">&nbsp;</a>Ye said also, Behold, what a weariness
<span class="add">is it!</span> and ye have snuffed at it, saith the LORD of hosts; and ye brought
<span class="add">that which was
</span> torn, and the lame, and the sick; thus ye brought an offering: should I accept this of your hand? saith
the LORD.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C1V14">&nbsp;</a>But cursed
<span class="add">be</span> the deceiver, which hath in his flock a male, and voweth, and sacrificeth unto the LORD a corrupt thing:
for I
<span class="add">am
</span> a great King, saith the LORD of hosts, and my name
<span class="add">is</span> dreadful among the heathen.
