 <span class="verse" id="V1">1&nbsp;</span> The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God;  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span> As it is written in the prophets, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, which shall prepare thy way before thee.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span> The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span> John did baptize in the wilderness, and preach the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span> And there went out unto him all the land of Judæa, and they of Jerusalem, and were all baptized of him in the river of Jordan, confessing their sins.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span> And John was clothed with camel’s hair, and with a girdle of a skin about his loins; and he did eat locusts and wild honey;  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span> And preached, saying, There cometh one mightier than I after me, the latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to stoop down and unloose.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span> I indeed have baptized you with water: but he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span> And it came to pass in those days, that Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee, and was baptized of John in Jordan.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span> And straightway coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens opened, and the Spirit like a dove descending upon him:  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span> And there came a voice from heaven, <span class='add'>saying</span>, Thou art my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span> And immediately the Spirit driveth him into the wilderness.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span> And he was there in the wilderness forty days, tempted of Satan; and was with the wild beasts; and the angels ministered unto him.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span> Now after that John was put in prison, Jesus came into Galilee, preaching the gospel of the kingdom of God,  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span> And saying, <span class='wj'> The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand: repent ye, and believe the gospel.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span> Now as he walked by the sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew his brother casting a net into the sea: for they were fishers.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span> And Jesus said unto them, <span class='wj'> Come ye after me, and I will make you to become fishers of men.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span> And straightway they forsook their nets, and followed him.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span> And when he had gone a little further thence, he saw James the <span class='add'>son</span> of Zebedee, and John his brother, who also were in the ship mending their nets.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span> And straightway he called them: and they left their father Zebedee in the ship with the hired servants, and went after him.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span> And they went into Capernaum; and straightway on the sabbath day he entered into the synagogue, and taught.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span> And they were astonished at his doctrine: for he taught them as one that had authority, and not as the scribes.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span> And there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit; and he cried out,  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span> Saying, Let <span class='add'>us</span> alone; what have we to do with thee, thou Jesus of Nazareth? art thou come to destroy us? I know thee who thou art, the Holy One of God.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span> And Jesus rebuked him, saying, <span class='wj'> Hold thy peace, and come out of him.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span> And when the unclean spirit had torn him, and cried with a loud voice, he came out of him.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span> And they were all amazed, insomuch that they questioned among themselves, saying, What thing is this? what new doctrine <span class='add'>is</span> this? for with authority commandeth he even the unclean spirits, and they do obey him.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&nbsp;</span> And immediately his fame spread abroad throughout all the region round about Galilee.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&nbsp;</span> And forthwith, when they were come out of the synagogue, they entered into the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&nbsp;</span> But Simon’s wife’s mother lay sick of a fever, and anon they tell him of her.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&nbsp;</span> And he came and took her by the hand, and lifted her up; and immediately the fever left her, and she ministered unto them.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&nbsp;</span> And at even, when the sun did set, they brought unto him all that were diseased, and them that were possessed with devils.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&nbsp;</span> And all the city was gathered together at the door.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&nbsp;</span> And he healed many that were sick of divers diseases, and cast out many devils; and suffered not the devils to speak, because they knew him.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&nbsp;</span> And in the morning, rising up a great while before day, he went out, and departed into a solitary place, and there prayed.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&nbsp;</span> And Simon and they that were with him followed after him.  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&nbsp;</span> And when they had found him, they said unto him, All <span class='add'>men</span> seek for thee.  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&nbsp;</span> And he said unto them, <span class='wj'> Let us go into the next towns, that I may preach there also: for therefore came I forth.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&nbsp;</span> And he preached in their synagogues throughout all Galilee, and cast out devils.  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&nbsp;</span> And there came a leper to him, beseeching him, and kneeling down to him, and saying unto him, If thou wilt, thou canst make me clean.  <span class="verse" id="V41">41&nbsp;</span> And Jesus, moved with compassion, put forth <span class='add'>his</span> hand, and touched him, and saith unto him, <span class='wj'> I will; be thou clean.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V42">42&nbsp;</span> And as soon as he had spoken, immediately the leprosy departed from him, and he was cleansed.  <span class="verse" id="V43">43&nbsp;</span> And he straitly charged him, and forthwith sent him away;  <span class="verse" id="V44">44&nbsp;</span> And saith unto him, <span class='wj'> See thou say nothing to any man: but go thy way, shew thyself to the priest, and offer for thy cleansing those things which Moses commanded, for a testimony unto them.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V45">45&nbsp;</span> But he went out, and began to publish <span class='add'>it</span> much, and to blaze abroad the matter, insomuch that Jesus could no more openly enter into the city, but was without in desert places: and they came to him from every quarter. </div><ul class='tnav'>
