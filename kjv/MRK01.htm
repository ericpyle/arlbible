<div class="mt1">The Gospel According to St. Mark
</div>
<div class="chapterlabel"> 1</div><div class="p">
 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C1V1">&nbsp;</a>The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God;
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C1V2">&nbsp;</a>As it is written in the prophets, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, which shall prepare thy
way before thee.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C1V3">&nbsp;</a>The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C1V4">&nbsp;</a>John did baptize in the wilderness, and preach the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C1V5">&nbsp;</a>And there went out unto him all the land of Judaea, and they of Jerusalem, and were all baptized of him
in the river of Jordan, confessing their sins.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C1V6">&nbsp;</a>And John was clothed with camel’s hair, and with a girdle of a skin about his loins; and he did eat locusts
and wild honey;
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C1V7">&nbsp;</a>And preached, saying, There cometh one mightier than I after me, the latchet of whose shoes I am not
worthy to stoop down and unloose.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C1V8">&nbsp;</a>I indeed have baptized you with water: but he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C1V9">&nbsp;</a>And it came to pass in those days, that Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee, and was baptized of John
in Jordan.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C1V10">&nbsp;</a>And straightway coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens opened, and the Spirit like a dove descending
upon him:
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C1V11">&nbsp;</a>And there came a voice from heaven,
<span class="add">saying,</span> Thou art my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C1V12">&nbsp;</a>And immediately the Spirit driveth him into the wilderness.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C1V13">&nbsp;</a>And he was there in the wilderness forty days, tempted of Satan; and was with the wild beasts; and the
angels ministered unto him.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C1V14">&nbsp;</a>Now after that John was put in prison, Jesus came into Galilee, preaching the gospel of the kingdom of
God,
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C1V15">&nbsp;</a>And saying,
<span class="wj">The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand: repent ye, and believe the gospel.
</span> <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C1V16">&nbsp;</a>Now as he walked by the sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew his brother casting a net into the sea:
for they were fishers.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C1V17">&nbsp;</a>And Jesus said unto them,
<span class="wj">Come ye after me, and I will make you to become fishers of men.
</span> <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C1V18">&nbsp;</a>And straightway they forsook their nets, and followed him.
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C1V19">&nbsp;</a>And when he had gone a little farther thence, he saw James the
<span class="add">son</span> of Zebedee, and John his brother, who also were in the ship mending their nets.
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C1V20">&nbsp;</a>And straightway he called them: and they left their father Zebedee in the ship with the hired servants,
and went after him.
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C1V21">&nbsp;</a>And they went into Capernaum; and straightway on the sabbath day he entered into the synagogue, and taught.
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C1V22">&nbsp;</a>And they were astonished at his doctrine: for he taught them as one that had authority, and not as the
scribes.
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C1V23">&nbsp;</a>And there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit; and he cried out,
 <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C1V24">&nbsp;</a>Saying, Let
<span class="add">us</span> alone; what have we to do with thee, thou Jesus of Nazareth? art thou come to destroy us? I know thee
who thou art, the Holy One of God.
 <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C1V25">&nbsp;</a>And Jesus rebuked him, saying,
<span class="wj">Hold thy peace, and come out of him.
</span> <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C1V26">&nbsp;</a>And when the unclean spirit had torn him, and cried with a loud voice, he came out of him.
 <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C1V27">&nbsp;</a>And they were all amazed, insomuch that they questioned among themselves, saying, What thing is this?
what new doctrine
<span class="add">is</span> this? for with authority commandeth he even the unclean spirits, and they do obey him.
 <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C1V28">&nbsp;</a>And immediately his fame spread abroad throughout all the region round about Galilee.
 <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C1V29">&nbsp;</a>And forthwith, when they were come out of the synagogue, they entered into the house of Simon and Andrew,
with James and John.
 <span class="verse"> 30</span><a name="C1V30">&nbsp;</a>But Simon’s wife’s mother lay sick of a fever, and anon they tell him of her.
 <span class="verse"> 31</span><a name="C1V31">&nbsp;</a>And he came and took her by the hand, and lifted her up; and immediately the fever left her, and she
ministered unto them.
 <span class="verse"> 32</span><a name="C1V32">&nbsp;</a>And at even, when the sun did set, they brought unto him all that were diseased, and them that were possessed
with devils.
 <span class="verse"> 33</span><a name="C1V33">&nbsp;</a>And all the city was gathered together at the door.
 <span class="verse"> 34</span><a name="C1V34">&nbsp;</a>And he healed many that were sick of divers diseases, and cast out many devils; and suffered not the
devils to speak, because they knew him.
 <span class="verse"> 35</span><a name="C1V35">&nbsp;</a>And in the morning, rising up a great while before day, he went out, and departed into a solitary place,
and there prayed.
 <span class="verse"> 36</span><a name="C1V36">&nbsp;</a>And Simon and they that were with him followed after him.
 <span class="verse"> 37</span><a name="C1V37">&nbsp;</a>And when they had found him, they said unto him, All
<span class="add">men</span> seek for thee.
 <span class="verse"> 38</span><a name="C1V38">&nbsp;</a>And he said unto them,
<span class="wj">Let us go into the next towns, that I may preach there also: for therefore came I forth.
</span> <span class="verse"> 39</span><a name="C1V39">&nbsp;</a>And he preached in their synagogues throughout all Galilee, and cast out devils.
 <span class="verse"> 40</span><a name="C1V40">&nbsp;</a>And there came a leper to him, beseeching him, and kneeling down to him, and saying unto him, If thou
wilt, thou canst make me clean.
 <span class="verse"> 41</span><a name="C1V41">&nbsp;</a>And Jesus, moved with compassion, put forth
<span class="add">his</span> hand, and touched him, and saith unto him,
<span class="wj">I will; be thou clean.
</span> <span class="verse"> 42</span><a name="C1V42">&nbsp;</a>And as soon as he had spoken, immediately the leprosy departed from him, and he was cleansed.
 <span class="verse"> 43</span><a name="C1V43">&nbsp;</a>And he straitly charged him, and forthwith sent him away;
 <span class="verse"> 44</span><a name="C1V44">&nbsp;</a>And saith unto him,
<span class="wj">See thou say nothing to any man: but go thy way, shew thyself to the priest, and offer for thy cleansing
those things which Moses commanded, for a testimony unto them.
</span> <span class="verse"> 45</span><a name="C1V45">&nbsp;</a>But he went out, and began to publish
<span class="add">it</span> much, and to blaze abroad the matter, insomuch that Jesus could no more openly enter into the city,
but was without in desert places: and they came to him from every quarter.
