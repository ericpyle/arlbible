 <span class="verse" id="V1">1&nbsp;</span>And the LORD said unto Moses, Yet will I bring one plague <span class='add'>more</span> upon Pharaoh, and upon Egypt; afterwards he will let you go hence: when he shall let <span class='add'>you</span> go, he shall surely thrust you out hence altogether.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span>Speak now in the ears of the people, and let every man borrow of his neighbour, and every woman of her neighbour, jewels of silver, and jewels of gold.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>And the LORD gave the people favour in the sight of the Egyptians. Moreover the man Moses <span class='add'>was</span> very great in the land of Egypt, in the sight of Pharaoh’s servants, and in the sight of the people.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>And Moses said, Thus saith the LORD, About midnight will I go out into the midst of Egypt:  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>And all the firstborn in the land of Egypt shall die, from the firstborn of Pharaoh that sitteth upon his throne, even unto the firstborn of the maidservant that <span class='add'>is</span> behind the mill; and all the firstborn of beasts.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>And there shall be a great cry throughout all the land of Egypt, such as there was none like it, nor shall be like it any more.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>But against any of the children of Israel shall not a dog move his tongue, against man or beast: that ye may know how that the LORD doth put a difference between the Egyptians and Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>And all these thy servants shall come down unto me, and bow down themselves unto me, saying, Get thee out, and all the people that follow thee: and after that I will go out. And he went out from Pharaoh in a great anger.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>And the LORD said unto Moses, Pharaoh shall not hearken unto you; that my wonders may be multiplied in the land of Egypt.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>And Moses and Aaron did all these wonders before Pharaoh: and the LORD hardened Pharaoh’s heart, so that he would not let the children of Israel go out of his land. </div><ul class='tnav'>
