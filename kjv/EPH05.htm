 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C5V1">&nbsp;</a>Be ye therefore followers of God, as dear children;
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C5V2">&nbsp;</a>And walk in love, as Christ also hath loved us, and hath given himself for us an offering and a sacrifice
to God for a sweetsmelling savour.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C5V3">&nbsp;</a>But fornication, and all uncleanness, or covetousness, let it not be once named among you, as becometh
saints;
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C5V4">&nbsp;</a>Neither filthiness, nor foolish talking, nor jesting, which are not convenient: but rather giving of
thanks.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C5V5">&nbsp;</a>For this ye know, that no whoremonger, nor unclean person, nor covetous man, who is an idolater, hath
any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C5V6">&nbsp;</a>Let no man deceive you with vain words: for because of these things cometh the wrath of God upon the
children of disobedience.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C5V7">&nbsp;</a>Be not ye therefore partakers with them.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C5V8">&nbsp;</a>For ye were sometimes darkness, but now
<span class="add">are ye</span> light in the Lord: walk as children of light:
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C5V9">&nbsp;</a>(For the fruit of the Spirit is in all goodness and righteousness and truth;)
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C5V10">&nbsp;</a>Proving what is acceptable unto the Lord.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C5V11">&nbsp;</a>And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove
<span class="add">them.
</span> <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C5V12">&nbsp;</a>For it is a shame even to speak of those things which are done of them in secret.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C5V13">&nbsp;</a>But all things that are reproved are made manifest by the light: for whatsoever doth make manifest is
light.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C5V14">&nbsp;</a>Wherefore he saith, Awake thou that sleepest, and arise from the dead, and Christ shall give thee light.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C5V15">&nbsp;</a>See then that ye walk circumspectly, not as fools, but as wise,
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C5V16">&nbsp;</a>Redeeming the time, because the days are evil.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C5V17">&nbsp;</a>Wherefore be ye not unwise, but understanding what the will of the Lord
<span class="add">is.
</span> <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C5V18">&nbsp;</a>And be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess; but be filled with the Spirit;
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C5V19">&nbsp;</a>Speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody in your heart
to the Lord;
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C5V20">&nbsp;</a>Giving thanks always for all things unto God and the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ;
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C5V21">&nbsp;</a>Submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of God.
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C5V22">&nbsp;</a>Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as unto the Lord.
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C5V23">&nbsp;</a>For the husband is the head of the wife, even as Christ is the head of the church: and he is the saviour
of the body.
 <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C5V24">&nbsp;</a>Therefore as the church is subject unto Christ, so
<span class="add">let</span> the wives
<span class="add">be</span> to their own husbands in every thing.
 <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C5V25">&nbsp;</a>Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church, and gave himself for it;
 <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C5V26">&nbsp;</a>That he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word,
 <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C5V27">&nbsp;</a>That he might present it to himself a glorious church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing;
but that it should be holy and without blemish.
 <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C5V28">&nbsp;</a>So ought men to love their wives as their own bodies. He that loveth his wife loveth himself.
 <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C5V29">&nbsp;</a>For no man ever yet hated his own flesh; but nourisheth and cherisheth it, even as the Lord the church:
 <span class="verse"> 30</span><a name="C5V30">&nbsp;</a>For we are members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones.
 <span class="verse"> 31</span><a name="C5V31">&nbsp;</a>For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall be joined unto his wife, and they two
shall be one flesh.
 <span class="verse"> 32</span><a name="C5V32">&nbsp;</a>This is a great mystery: but I speak concerning Christ and the church.
 <span class="verse"> 33</span><a name="C5V33">&nbsp;</a>Nevertheless let every one of you in particular so love his wife even as himself; and the wife
<span class="add">see</span> that she reverence
<span class="add">her</span> husband.
