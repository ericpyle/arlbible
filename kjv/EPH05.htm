 <span class="verse" id="V1">1&nbsp;</span> Be ye therefore followers of God, as dear children;  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span> And walk in love, as Christ also hath loved us, and hath given himself for us an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweetsmelling savour.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span> But fornication, and all uncleanness, or covetousness , let it not be once named among you, as becometh saints;  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span> Neither filthiness, nor foolish talking, nor jesting, which are not convenient: but rather giving of thanks.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span> For this ye know, that no whoremonger, nor unclean person, nor covetous man, who is an idolater, hath any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span> Let no man deceive you with vain words: for because of these things cometh the wrath of God upon the children of disobedience.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span> Be not ye therefore partakers with them.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span> For ye were sometimes darkness, but now <span class='add'>are ye</span> light in the Lord: walk as children of light:  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>(For the fruit of the Spirit <span class='add'>is</span> in all goodness and righteousness and truth;)  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span> Proving what is acceptable unto the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span> And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove <span class='add'>them</span>.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span> For it is a shame even to speak of those things which are done of them in secret.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span> But all things that are reproved are made manifest by the light: for whatsoever doth make manifest is light.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span> Wherefore he saith, Awake thou that sleepest, and arise from the dead, and Christ shall give thee light.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span> See then that ye walk circumspectly, not as fools , but as wise,  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span> Redeeming the time, because the days are evil.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span> Wherefore be ye not unwise, but understanding what the will of the Lord <span class='add'>is</span>.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span> And be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess; but be filled with the Spirit;  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span> Speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord;  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span> Giving thanks always for all things unto God and the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ;  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span> Submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of God.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span> Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as unto the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span> For the husband is the head of the wife, even as Christ is the head of the church: and he is the saviour of the body.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span> Therefore as the church is subject unto Christ, so <span class='add'>let</span> the wives <span class='add'>be</span> to their own husbands in every thing.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span> Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church, and gave himself for it;  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span> That he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word,  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span> That he might present it to himself a glorious church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&nbsp;</span> So ought men to love their wives as their own bodies. He that loveth his wife loveth himself.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&nbsp;</span> For no man ever yet hated his own flesh; but nourisheth and cherisheth it, even as the Lord the church:  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&nbsp;</span> For we are members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&nbsp;</span> For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall be joined unto his wife, and they two shall be one flesh.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&nbsp;</span> This is a great mystery: but I speak concerning Christ and the church.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&nbsp;</span> Nevertheless let every one of you in particular so love his wife even as himself; and the wife <span class='add'>see</span> that she reverence <span class='add'>her</span> husband. </div><ul class='tnav'>
