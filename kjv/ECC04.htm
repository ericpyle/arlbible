 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C4V1">&nbsp;</a>So I returned, and considered all the oppressions that are done under the sun: and behold the tears of
<span class="add">such as were</span> oppressed, and they had no comforter; and on the side of their oppressors
<span class="add">there was</span> power; but they had no comforter.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C4V2">&nbsp;</a>Wherefore I praised the dead which are already dead more than the living which are yet alive.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C4V3">&nbsp;</a>Yea, better
<span class="add">is he</span> than both they, which hath not yet been, who hath not seen the evil work that is done under the sun.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C4V4">&nbsp;</a>Again, I considered all travail, and every right work, that for this a man is envied of his neighbour.
This
<span class="add">is</span> also vanity and vexation of spirit.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C4V5">&nbsp;</a>The fool foldeth his hands together, and eateth his own flesh.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C4V6">&nbsp;</a>Better
<span class="add">is</span> an handful
<span class="add">with</span> quietness, than both the hands full
<span class="add">with</span> travail and vexation of spirit.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C4V7">&nbsp;</a>Then I returned, and I saw vanity under the sun.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C4V8">&nbsp;</a>There is one
<span class="add">alone,</span> and
<span class="add">there is</span> not a second; yea, he hath neither child nor brother: yet
<span class="add">is there</span> no end of all his labour; neither is his eye satisfied with riches; neither
<span class="add">saith he,
</span> For whom do I labour, and bereave my soul of good? This
<span class="add">is
</span> also vanity, yea, it
<span class="add">is</span> a sore travail.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C4V9">&nbsp;</a>Two
<span class="add">are</span> better than one; because they have a good reward for their labour.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C4V10">&nbsp;</a>For if they fall, the one will lift up his fellow: but woe to him
<span class="add">that is</span> alone when he falleth; for
<span class="add">he hath</span> not another to help him up.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C4V11">&nbsp;</a>Again, if two lie together, then they have heat: but how can one be warm
<span class="add">alone?
</span> <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C4V12">&nbsp;</a>And if one prevail against him, two shall withstand him; and a threefold cord is not quickly broken.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C4V13">&nbsp;</a>Better
<span class="add">is</span> a poor and a wise child than an old and foolish king, who will no more be admonished.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C4V14">&nbsp;</a>For out of prison he cometh to reign; whereas also
<span class="add">he that is
</span> born in his kingdom becometh poor.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C4V15">&nbsp;</a>I considered all the living which walk under the sun, with the second child that shall stand up in his
stead.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C4V16">&nbsp;</a><span class="add">There is</span> no end of all the people,
<span class="add">even</span> of all that have been before them: they also that come after shall not rejoice in him. Surely this also
<span class="add">is</span> vanity and vexation of spirit.
