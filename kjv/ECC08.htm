<div class="chapterlabel"> 8</div><div class="p">
 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C8V1">&nbsp;</a>Who
<span class="add">is</span> as the wise
<span class="add">man?</span> and who knoweth the interpretation of a thing? a man’s wisdom maketh his face to shine, and the boldness
of his face shall be changed.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C8V2">&nbsp;</a>I
<span class="add">counsel thee</span> to keep the king’s commandment, and
<span class="add">that
</span> in regard of the oath of God.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C8V3">&nbsp;</a>Be not hasty to go out of his sight: stand not in an evil thing; for he doeth whatsoever pleaseth him.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C8V4">&nbsp;</a>Where the word of a king
<span class="add">is, there is</span> power: and who may say unto him, What doest thou?
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C8V5">&nbsp;</a>Whoso keepeth the commandment shall feel no evil thing: and a wise man’s heart discerneth both time and
judgment.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C8V6">&nbsp;</a>Because to every purpose there is time and judgment, therefore the misery of man
<span class="add">is</span> great upon him.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C8V7">&nbsp;</a>For he knoweth not that which shall be: for who can tell him when it shall be?
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C8V8">&nbsp;</a><span class="add">There is</span> no man that hath power over the spirit to retain the spirit; neither
<span class="add">hath he</span> power in the day of death: and
<span class="add">there is</span> no discharge in
<span class="add">that</span> war; neither shall wickedness deliver those that are given to it.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C8V9">&nbsp;</a>All this have I seen, and applied my heart unto every work that is done under the sun:
<span class="add">there is</span> a time wherein one man ruleth over another to his own hurt.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C8V10">&nbsp;</a>And so I saw the wicked buried, who had come and gone from the place of the holy, and they were forgotten
in the city where they had so done: this
<span class="add">is</span> also vanity.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C8V11">&nbsp;</a>Because sentence against an evil work is not executed speedily, therefore the heart of the sons of men
is fully set in them to do evil.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C8V12">&nbsp;</a>Though a sinner do evil an hundred times, and his
<span class="add">days</span> be prolonged, yet surely I know that it shall be well with them that fear God, which fear before him:
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C8V13">&nbsp;</a>But it shall not be well with the wicked, neither shall he prolong
<span class="add">his</span> days,
<span class="add">which are</span> as a shadow; because he feareth not before God.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C8V14">&nbsp;</a>There is a vanity which is done upon the earth; that there be just
<span class="add">men,</span> unto whom it happeneth according to the work of the wicked; again, there be wicked
<span class="add">men,</span> to whom it happeneth according to the work of the righteous: I said that this also
<span class="add">is</span> vanity.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C8V15">&nbsp;</a>Then I commended mirth, because a man hath no better thing under the sun, than to eat, and to drink,
and to be merry: for that shall abide with him of his labour the days of his life, which God giveth him
under the sun.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C8V16">&nbsp;</a>When I applied mine heart to know wisdom, and to see the business that is done upon the earth: (for also
<span class="add">there is that</span> neither day nor night seeth sleep with his eyes:)
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C8V17">&nbsp;</a>Then I beheld all the work of God, that a man cannot find out the work that is done under the sun: because
though a man labour to seek
<span class="add">it
</span> out, yet he shall not find
<span class="add">it;</span> yea further; though a wise
<span class="add">man</span> think to know
<span class="add">it,</span> yet shall he not be able to find
<span class="add">it.</span></div>
