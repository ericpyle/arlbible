 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C2V1">&nbsp;</a>Woe to them that devise iniquity, and work evil upon their beds! when the morning is light, they practise
it, because it is in the power of their hand.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C2V2">&nbsp;</a>And they covet fields, and take
<span class="add">them</span> by violence; and houses, and take
<span class="add">them</span> away: so they oppress a man and his house, even a man and his heritage.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C2V3">&nbsp;</a>Therefore thus saith the LORD; Behold, against this family do I devise an evil, from which ye shall not
remove your necks; neither shall ye go haughtily: for this time
<span class="add">is</span> evil.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C2V4">&nbsp;</a>In that day shall
<span class="add">one</span> take up a parable against you, and lament with a doleful lamentation,
<span class="add">and</span> say, We be utterly spoiled: he hath changed the portion of my people: how hath he removed
<span class="add">it</span> from me! turning away he hath divided our fields.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C2V5">&nbsp;</a>Therefore thou shalt have none that shall cast a cord by lot in the congregation of the LORD.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C2V6">&nbsp;</a>Prophesy ye not,
<span class="add">say they to them that</span> prophesy: they shall not prophesy to them,
<span class="add">that</span> they shall not take shame.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C2V7">&nbsp;</a>O
<span class="add">thou that art</span> named the house of Jacob, is the spirit of the LORD straitened?
<span class="add">are</span> these his doings? do not my words do good to him that walketh uprightly?
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C2V8">&nbsp;</a>Even of late my people is risen up as an enemy: ye pull off the robe with the garment from them that
pass by securely as men averse from war.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C2V9">&nbsp;</a>The women of my people have ye cast out from their pleasant houses; from their children have ye taken
away my glory for ever.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C2V10">&nbsp;</a>Arise ye, and depart; for this
<span class="add">is</span> not
<span class="add">your</span> rest: because it is polluted, it shall destroy
<span class="add">you,</span> even with a sore destruction.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C2V11">&nbsp;</a>If a man walking in the spirit and falsehood do lie,
<span class="add">saying,</span> I will prophesy unto thee of wine and of strong drink; he shall even be the prophet of this people.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C2V12">&nbsp;</a>I will surely assemble, O Jacob, all of thee; I will surely gather the remnant of Israel; I will put
them together as the sheep of Bozrah, as the flock in the midst of their fold: they shall make great
noise by reason of
<span class="add">the multitude of</span> men.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C2V13">&nbsp;</a>The breaker is come up before them: they have broken up, and have passed through the gate, and are gone
out by it: and their king shall pass before them, and the LORD on the head of them.
