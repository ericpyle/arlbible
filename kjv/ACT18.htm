 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C18V1">&nbsp;</a>After these things Paul departed from Athens, and came to Corinth;
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C18V2">&nbsp;</a>And found a certain Jew named Aquila, born in Pontus, lately come from Italy, with his wife Priscilla;
(because that Claudius had commanded all Jews to depart from Rome:) and came unto them.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C18V3">&nbsp;</a>And because he was of the same craft, he abode with them, and wrought: for by their occupation they were
tentmakers.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C18V4">&nbsp;</a>And he reasoned in the synagogue every sabbath, and persuaded the Jews and the Greeks.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C18V5">&nbsp;</a>And when Silas and Timotheus were come from Macedonia, Paul was pressed in the spirit, and testified
to the Jews
<span class="add">that</span> Jesus
<span class="add">was
</span> Christ.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C18V6">&nbsp;</a>And when they opposed themselves, and blasphemed, he shook
<span class="add">his
</span> raiment, and said unto them, Your blood
<span class="add">be</span> upon your own heads; I
<span class="add">am</span> clean: from henceforth I will go unto the Gentiles.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C18V7">&nbsp;</a>And he departed thence, and entered into a certain
<span class="add">man’s</span> house, named Justus,
<span class="add">one</span> that worshipped God, whose house joined hard to the synagogue.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C18V8">&nbsp;</a>And Crispus, the chief ruler of the synagogue, believed on the Lord with all his house; and many of the
Corinthians hearing believed, and were baptized.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C18V9">&nbsp;</a>Then spake the Lord to Paul in the night by a vision,
<span class="wj">Be not afraid, but speak, and hold not thy peace:
</span> <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C18V10">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">For I am with thee, and no man shall set on thee to hurt thee: for I have much people in this city.
</span> <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C18V11">&nbsp;</a>And he continued
<span class="add">there</span> a year and six months, teaching the word of God among them.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C18V12">&nbsp;</a>And when Gallio was the deputy of Achaia, the Jews made insurrection with one accord against Paul, and
brought him to the judgment seat,
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C18V13">&nbsp;</a>Saying, This
<span class="add">fellow</span> persuadeth men to worship God contrary to the law.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C18V14">&nbsp;</a>And when Paul was now about to open
<span class="add">his</span> mouth, Gallio said unto the Jews, If it were a matter of wrong or wicked lewdness, O
<span class="add">ye
</span> Jews, reason would that I should bear with you:
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C18V15">&nbsp;</a>But if it be a question of words and names, and
<span class="add">of</span> your law, look ye
<span class="add">to it;</span> for I will be no judge of such
<span class="add">matters.
</span> <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C18V16">&nbsp;</a>And he drave them from the judgment seat.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C18V17">&nbsp;</a>Then all the Greeks took Sosthenes, the chief ruler of the synagogue, and beat
<span class="add">him</span> before the judgment seat. And Gallio cared for none of those things.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C18V18">&nbsp;</a>And Paul
<span class="add">after this</span> tarried
<span class="add">there</span> yet a good while, and then took his leave of the brethren, and sailed thence into Syria, and with him
Priscilla and Aquila; having shorn
<span class="add">his</span> head in Cenchrea: for he had a vow.
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C18V19">&nbsp;</a>And he came to Ephesus, and left them there: but he himself entered into the synagogue, and reasoned
with the Jews.
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C18V20">&nbsp;</a>When they desired
<span class="add">him</span> to tarry longer time with them, he consented not;
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C18V21">&nbsp;</a>But bade them farewell, saying, I must by all means keep this feast that cometh in Jerusalem: but I will
return again unto you, if God will. And he sailed from Ephesus.
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C18V22">&nbsp;</a>And when he had landed at Caesarea, and gone up, and saluted the church, he went down to Antioch.
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C18V23">&nbsp;</a>And after he had spent some time
<span class="add">there,</span> he departed, and went over
<span class="add">all</span> the country of Galatia and Phrygia in order, strengthening all the disciples.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C18V24">&nbsp;</a>And a certain Jew named Apollos, born at Alexandria, an eloquent man,
<span class="add">and</span> mighty in the scriptures, came to Ephesus.
 <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C18V25">&nbsp;</a>This man was instructed in the way of the Lord; and being fervent in the spirit, he spake and taught
diligently the things of the Lord, knowing only the baptism of John.
 <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C18V26">&nbsp;</a>And he began to speak boldly in the synagogue: whom when Aquila and Priscilla had heard, they took him
unto
<span class="add">them,</span> and expounded unto him the way of God more perfectly.
 <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C18V27">&nbsp;</a>And when he was disposed to pass into Achaia, the brethren wrote, exhorting the disciples to receive
him: who, when he was come, helped them much which had believed through grace:
 <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C18V28">&nbsp;</a>For he mightily convinced the Jews,
<span class="add">and that</span> publickly, shewing by the scriptures that Jesus was Christ.
