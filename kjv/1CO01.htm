<div class="mt1">The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians
</div>
<div class="chapterlabel"> 1</div><div class="p">
 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C1V1">&nbsp;</a>Paul, called
<span class="add">to be</span> an apostle of Jesus Christ through the will of God, and Sosthenes
<span class="add">our</span> brother,
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C1V2">&nbsp;</a>Unto the church of God which is at Corinth, to them that are sanctified in Christ Jesus, called
<span class="add">to be</span> saints, with all that in every place call upon the name of Jesus Christ our Lord, both theirs and ours:
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C1V3">&nbsp;</a>Grace
<span class="add">be</span> unto you, and peace, from God our Father, and
<span class="add">from</span> the Lord Jesus Christ.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C1V4">&nbsp;</a>I thank my God always on your behalf, for the grace of God which is given you by Jesus Christ;
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C1V5">&nbsp;</a>That in every thing ye are enriched by him, in all utterance, and
<span class="add">in</span> all knowledge;
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C1V6">&nbsp;</a>Even as the testimony of Christ was confirmed in you:
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C1V7">&nbsp;</a>So that ye come behind in no gift; waiting for the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ:
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C1V8">&nbsp;</a>Who shall also confirm you unto the end,
<span class="add">that ye may be</span> blameless in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C1V9">&nbsp;</a>God
<span class="add">is</span> faithful, by whom ye were called unto the fellowship of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C1V10">&nbsp;</a>Now I beseech you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye all speak the same thing,
and
<span class="add">that</span> there be no divisions among you; but
<span class="add">that</span> ye be perfectly joined together in the same mind and in the same judgment.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C1V11">&nbsp;</a>For it hath been declared unto me of you, my brethren, by them
<span class="add">which are of the house</span> of Chloe, that there are contentions among you.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C1V12">&nbsp;</a>Now this I say, that every one of you saith, I am of Paul; and I of Apollos; and I of Cephas; and I of
Christ.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C1V13">&nbsp;</a>Is Christ divided? was Paul crucified for you? or were ye baptized in the name of Paul?
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C1V14">&nbsp;</a>I thank God that I baptized none of you, but Crispus and Gaius;
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C1V15">&nbsp;</a>Lest any should say that I had baptized in mine own name.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C1V16">&nbsp;</a>And I baptized also the household of Stephanas: besides, I know not whether I baptized any other.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C1V17">&nbsp;</a>For Christ sent me not to baptize, but to preach the gospel: not with wisdom of words, lest the cross
of Christ should be made of none effect.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C1V18">&nbsp;</a>For the preaching of the cross is to them that perish foolishness; but unto us which are saved it is
the power of God.
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C1V19">&nbsp;</a>For it is written, I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and will bring to nothing the understanding
of the prudent.
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C1V20">&nbsp;</a>Where
<span class="add">is</span> the wise? where
<span class="add">is</span> the scribe? where
<span class="add">is</span> the disputer of this world? hath not God made foolish the wisdom of this world?
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C1V21">&nbsp;</a>For after that in the wisdom of God the world by wisdom knew not God, it pleased God by the foolishness
of preaching to save them that believe.
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C1V22">&nbsp;</a>For the Jews require a sign, and the Greeks seek after wisdom:
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C1V23">&nbsp;</a>But we preach Christ crucified, unto the Jews a stumblingblock, and unto the Greeks foolishness;
 <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C1V24">&nbsp;</a>But unto them which are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God, and the wisdom of God.
 <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C1V25">&nbsp;</a>Because the foolishness of God is wiser than men; and the weakness of God is stronger than men.
 <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C1V26">&nbsp;</a>For ye see your calling, brethren, how that not many wise men after the flesh, not many mighty, not many
noble,
<span class="add">are called:
</span> <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C1V27">&nbsp;</a>But God hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise; and God hath chosen the weak
things of the world to confound the things which are mighty;
 <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C1V28">&nbsp;</a>And base things of the world, and things which are despised, hath God chosen,
<span class="add">yea,</span> and things which are not, to bring to nought things that are:
 <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C1V29">&nbsp;</a>That no flesh should glory in his presence.
 <span class="verse"> 30</span><a name="C1V30">&nbsp;</a>But of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification,
and redemption:
 <span class="verse"> 31</span><a name="C1V31">&nbsp;</a>That, according as it is written, He that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord.
