 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C42V1">&nbsp;</a>Now when Jacob saw that there was corn in Egypt, Jacob said unto his sons, Why do ye look one upon another?
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C42V2">&nbsp;</a>And he said, Behold, I have heard that there is corn in Egypt: get you down thither, and buy for us from
thence; that we may live, and not die.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C42V3">&nbsp;</a>And Joseph’s ten brethren went down to buy corn in Egypt.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C42V4">&nbsp;</a>But Benjamin, Joseph’s brother, Jacob sent not with his brethren; for he said, Lest peradventure mischief
befall him.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C42V5">&nbsp;</a>And the sons of Israel came to buy
<span class="add">corn</span> among those that came: for the famine was in the land of Canaan.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C42V6">&nbsp;</a>And Joseph
<span class="add">was</span> the governor over the land,
<span class="add">and</span> he
<span class="add">it was</span> that sold to all the people of the land: and Joseph’s brethren came, and bowed down themselves before
him
<span class="add">with</span> their faces to the earth.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C42V7">&nbsp;</a>And Joseph saw his brethren, and he knew them, but made himself strange unto them, and spake roughly
unto them; and he said unto them, Whence come ye? And they said, From the land of Canaan to buy food.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C42V8">&nbsp;</a>And Joseph knew his brethren, but they knew not him.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C42V9">&nbsp;</a>And Joseph remembered the dreams which he dreamed of them, and said unto them, Ye
<span class="add">are</span> spies; to see the nakedness of the land ye are come.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C42V10">&nbsp;</a>And they said unto him, Nay, my lord, but to buy food are thy servants come.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C42V11">&nbsp;</a>We
<span class="add">are</span> all one man’s sons; we
<span class="add">are</span> true
<span class="add">men,
</span> thy servants are no spies.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C42V12">&nbsp;</a>And he said unto them, Nay, but to see the nakedness of the land ye are come.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C42V13">&nbsp;</a>And they said, Thy servants
<span class="add">are</span> twelve brethren, the sons of one man in the land of Canaan; and, behold, the youngest
<span class="add">is</span> this day with our father, and one
<span class="add">is</span> not.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C42V14">&nbsp;</a>And Joseph said unto them, That
<span class="add">is it</span> that I spake unto you, saying, Ye
<span class="add">are</span> spies:
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C42V15">&nbsp;</a>Hereby ye shall be proved: By the life of Pharaoh ye shall not go forth hence, except your youngest brother
come hither.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C42V16">&nbsp;</a>Send one of you, and let him fetch your brother, and ye shall be kept in prison, that your words may
be proved, whether
<span class="add">there be any</span> truth in you: or else by the life of Pharaoh surely ye
<span class="add">are</span> spies.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C42V17">&nbsp;</a>And he put them all together into ward three days.
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C42V18">&nbsp;</a>And Joseph said unto them the third day, This do, and live;
<span class="add">for
</span> I fear God:
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C42V19">&nbsp;</a>If ye
<span class="add">be</span> true
<span class="add">men,</span> let one of your brethren be bound in the house of your prison: go ye, carry corn for the famine of your
houses:
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C42V20">&nbsp;</a>But bring your youngest brother unto me; so shall your words be verified, and ye shall not die. And they
did so.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C42V21">&nbsp;</a>And they said one to another, We
<span class="add">are</span> verily guilty concerning our brother, in that we saw the anguish of his soul, when he besought us, and
we would not hear; therefore is this distress come upon us.
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C42V22">&nbsp;</a>And Reuben answered them, saying, Spake I not unto you, saying, Do not sin against the child; and ye
would not hear? therefore, behold, also his blood is required.
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C42V23">&nbsp;</a>And they knew not that Joseph understood
<span class="add">them;</span> for he spake unto them by an interpreter.
 <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C42V24">&nbsp;</a>And he turned himself about from them, and wept; and returned to them again, and communed with them,
and took from them Simeon, and bound him before their eyes.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C42V25">&nbsp;</a>Then Joseph commanded to fill their sacks with corn, and to restore every man’s money into his sack,
and to give them provision for the way: and thus did he unto them.
 <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C42V26">&nbsp;</a>And they laded their asses with the corn, and departed thence.
 <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C42V27">&nbsp;</a>And as one of them opened his sack to give his ass provender in the inn, he espied his money; for, behold,
it
<span class="add">was</span> in his sack’s mouth.
 <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C42V28">&nbsp;</a>And he said unto his brethren, My money is restored; and, lo,
<span class="add">it is</span> even in my sack: and their heart failed
<span class="add">them,</span> and they were afraid, saying one to another, What
<span class="add">is</span> this
<span class="add">that
</span> God hath done unto us?
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C42V29">&nbsp;</a>And they came unto Jacob their father unto the land of Canaan, and told him all that befell unto them;
saying,
 <span class="verse"> 30</span><a name="C42V30">&nbsp;</a>The man,
<span class="add">who is</span> the lord of the land, spake roughly to us, and took us for spies of the country.
 <span class="verse"> 31</span><a name="C42V31">&nbsp;</a>And we said unto him, We
<span class="add">are</span> true
<span class="add">men;</span> we are no spies:
 <span class="verse"> 32</span><a name="C42V32">&nbsp;</a>We
<span class="add">be</span> twelve brethren, sons of our father; one
<span class="add">is
</span> not, and the youngest
<span class="add">is</span> this day with our father in the land of Canaan.
 <span class="verse"> 33</span><a name="C42V33">&nbsp;</a>And the man, the lord of the country, said unto us, Hereby shall I know that ye
<span class="add">are</span> true
<span class="add">men;</span> leave one of your brethren
<span class="add">here</span> with me, and take
<span class="add">food for</span> the famine of your households, and be gone:
 <span class="verse"> 34</span><a name="C42V34">&nbsp;</a>And bring your youngest brother unto me: then shall I know that ye
<span class="add">are</span> no spies, but
<span class="add">that</span> ye
<span class="add">are</span> true
<span class="add">men: so
</span> will I deliver you your brother, and ye shall traffick in the land.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 35</span><a name="C42V35">&nbsp;</a>And it came to pass as they emptied their sacks, that, behold, every man’s bundle of money
<span class="add">was</span> in his sack: and when
<span class="add">both
</span> they and their father saw the bundles of money, they were afraid.
 <span class="verse"> 36</span><a name="C42V36">&nbsp;</a>And Jacob their father said unto them, Me have ye bereaved
<span class="add">of my children:</span> Joseph
<span class="add">is</span> not, and Simeon
<span class="add">is</span> not, and ye will take Benjamin
<span class="add">away:</span> all these things are against me.
 <span class="verse"> 37</span><a name="C42V37">&nbsp;</a>And Reuben spake unto his father, saying, Slay my two sons, if I bring him not to thee: deliver him into
my hand, and I will bring him to thee again.
 <span class="verse"> 38</span><a name="C42V38">&nbsp;</a>And he said, My son shall not go down with you; for his brother is dead, and he is left alone: if mischief
befall him by the way in the which ye go, then shall ye bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave.
