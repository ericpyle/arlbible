 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C5V1">&nbsp;</a>And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C5V2">&nbsp;</a>Command the children of Israel, that they put out of the camp every leper, and every one that hath an
issue, and whosoever is defiled by the dead:
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C5V3">&nbsp;</a>Both male and female shall ye put out, without the camp shall ye put them; that they defile not their
camps, in the midst whereof I dwell.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C5V4">&nbsp;</a>And the children of Israel did so, and put them out without the camp: as the LORD spake unto Moses, so
did the children of Israel.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C5V5">&nbsp;</a>And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C5V6">&nbsp;</a>Speak unto the children of Israel, When a man or woman shall commit any sin that men commit, to do a
trespass against the LORD, and that person be guilty;
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C5V7">&nbsp;</a>Then they shall confess their sin which they have done: and he shall recompense his trespass with the
principal thereof, and add unto it the fifth
<span class="add">part</span> thereof, and give
<span class="add">it</span> unto
<span class="add">him</span> against whom he hath trespassed.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C5V8">&nbsp;</a>But if the man have no kinsman to recompense the trespass unto, let the trespass be recompensed unto
the LORD,
<span class="add">even</span> to the priest; beside the ram of the atonement, whereby an atonement shall be made for him.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C5V9">&nbsp;</a>And every offering of all the holy things of the children of Israel, which they bring unto the priest,
shall be his.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C5V10">&nbsp;</a>And every man’s hallowed things shall be his: whatsoever any man giveth the priest, it shall be his.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C5V11">&nbsp;</a>And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C5V12">&nbsp;</a>Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, If any man’s wife go aside, and commit a trespass
against him,
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C5V13">&nbsp;</a>And a man lie with her carnally, and it be hid from the eyes of her husband, and be kept close, and she
be defiled, and
<span class="add">there be</span> no witness against her, neither she be taken
<span class="add">with the manner;
</span> <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C5V14">&nbsp;</a>And the spirit of jealousy come upon him, and he be jealous of his wife, and she be defiled: or if the
spirit of jealousy come upon him, and he be jealous of his wife, and she be not defiled:
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C5V15">&nbsp;</a>Then shall the man bring his wife unto the priest, and he shall bring her offering for her, the tenth
<span class="add">part</span> of an ephah of barley meal; he shall pour no oil upon it, nor put frankincense thereon; for it
<span class="add">is</span> an offering of jealousy, an offering of memorial, bringing iniquity to remembrance.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C5V16">&nbsp;</a>And the priest shall bring her near, and set her before the LORD:
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C5V17">&nbsp;</a>And the priest shall take holy water in an earthen vessel; and of the dust that is in the floor of the
tabernacle the priest shall take, and put
<span class="add">it</span> into the water:
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C5V18">&nbsp;</a>And the priest shall set the woman before the LORD, and uncover the woman’s head, and put the offering
of memorial in her hands, which
<span class="add">is</span> the jealousy offering: and the priest shall have in his hand the bitter water that causeth the curse:
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C5V19">&nbsp;</a>And the priest shall charge her by an oath, and say unto the woman, If no man have lain with thee, and
if thou hast not gone aside to uncleanness
<span class="add">with another</span> instead of thy husband, be thou free from this bitter water that causeth the curse:
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C5V20">&nbsp;</a>But if thou hast gone aside
<span class="add">to another</span> instead of thy husband, and if thou be defiled, and some man have lain with thee beside thine husband:
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C5V21">&nbsp;</a>Then the priest shall charge the woman with an oath of cursing, and the priest shall say unto the woman,
The LORD make thee a curse and an oath among thy people, when the LORD doth make thy thigh to rot, and
thy belly to swell;
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C5V22">&nbsp;</a>And this water that causeth the curse shall go into thy bowels, to make
<span class="add">thy</span> belly to swell, and
<span class="add">thy</span> thigh to rot: And the woman shall say, Amen, amen.
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C5V23">&nbsp;</a>And the priest shall write these curses in a book, and he shall blot
<span class="add">them</span> out with the bitter water:
 <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C5V24">&nbsp;</a>And he shall cause the woman to drink the bitter water that causeth the curse: and the water that causeth
the curse shall enter into her,
<span class="add">and become</span> bitter.
 <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C5V25">&nbsp;</a>Then the priest shall take the jealousy offering out of the woman’s hand, and shall wave the offering
before the LORD, and offer it upon the altar:
 <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C5V26">&nbsp;</a>And the priest shall take an handful of the offering,
<span class="add">even</span> the memorial thereof, and burn
<span class="add">it</span> upon the altar, and afterward shall cause the woman to drink the water.
 <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C5V27">&nbsp;</a>And when he hath made her to drink the water, then it shall come to pass,
<span class="add">that,</span> if she be defiled, and have done trespass against her husband, that the water that causeth the curse
shall enter into her,
<span class="add">and become</span> bitter, and her belly shall swell, and her thigh shall rot: and the woman shall be a curse among her
people.
 <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C5V28">&nbsp;</a>And if the woman be not defiled, but be clean; then she shall be free, and shall conceive seed.
 <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C5V29">&nbsp;</a>This
<span class="add">is</span> the law of jealousies, when a wife goeth aside
<span class="add">to another</span> instead of her husband, and is defiled;
 <span class="verse"> 30</span><a name="C5V30">&nbsp;</a>Or when the spirit of jealousy cometh upon him, and he be jealous over his wife, and shall set the woman
before the LORD, and the priest shall execute upon her all this law.
 <span class="verse"> 31</span><a name="C5V31">&nbsp;</a>Then shall the man be guiltless from iniquity, and this woman shall bear her iniquity.
