 <span class="verse" id="V1">1&nbsp;</span>Now there was a man of Benjamin, whose name <span class='add'>was</span> Kish, the son of Abiel, the son of Zeror, the son of Bechorath, the son of Aphiah, a Benjamite, a mighty man of power.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span>And he had a son, whose name <span class='add'>was</span> Saul, a choice young man, and a goodly: and <span class='add'>there was</span> not among the children of Israel a goodlier person than he: from his shoulders and upward <span class='add'>he was</span> higher than any of the people.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>And the asses of Kish Saul’s father were lost. And Kish said to Saul his son, Take now one of the servants with thee, and arise, go seek the asses.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>And he passed through mount Ephraim, and passed through the land of Shalisha, but they found <span class='add'>them</span> not: then they passed through the land of Shalim, and <span class='add'>there they were</span> not: and he passed through the land of the Benjamites, but they found <span class='add'>them</span> not.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span> <span class='add'>And</span> when they were come to the land of Zuph, Saul said to his servant that <span class='add'>was</span> with him, Come, and let us return; lest my father leave <span class='add'>caring</span> for the asses, and take thought for us.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>And he said unto him, Behold now, <span class='add'>there is</span> in this city a man of God, and <span class='add'>he is</span> an honourable man; all that he saith cometh surely to pass: now let us go thither; peradventure he can shew us our way that we should go.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>Then said Saul to his servant, But, behold, <span class='add'>if</span> we go, what shall we bring the man? for the bread is spent in our vessels, and <span class='add'>there is</span> not a present to bring to the man of God: what have we?  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>And the servant answered Saul again, and said, Behold, I have here at hand the fourth part of a shekel of silver: <span class='add'>that</span> will I give to the man of God, to tell us our way.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>(Beforetime in Israel, when a man went to enquire of God, thus he spake, Come, and let us go to the seer: for <span class='add'>he that is</span> now <span class='add'>called</span> a Prophet was beforetime called a Seer.)  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>Then said Saul to his servant, Well said; come, let us go. So they went unto the city where the man of God <span class='add'>was</span>. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span> <span class='add'>And</span> as they went up the hill to the city, they found young maidens going out to draw water, and said unto them, Is the seer here?  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>And they answered them, and said, He is; behold, <span class='add'>he is</span> before you: make haste now, for he came to day to the city; for <span class='add'>there is</span> a sacrifice of the people to day in the high place:  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>As soon as ye be come into the city, ye shall straightway find him, before he go up to the high place to eat: for the people will not eat until he come, because he doth bless the sacrifice; <span class='add'>and</span> afterwards they eat that be bidden. Now therefore get you up; for about this time ye shall find him.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>And they went up into the city: <span class='add'>and</span> when they were come into the city, behold, Samuel came out against them, for to go up to the high place. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>Now the LORD had told Samuel in his ear a day before Saul came, saying,  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>To morrow about this time I will send thee a man out of the land of Benjamin, and thou shalt anoint him <span class='add'>to be</span> captain over my people Israel, that he may save my people out of the hand of the Philistines: for I have looked upon my people, because their cry is come unto me.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>And when Samuel saw Saul, the LORD said unto him, Behold the man whom I spake to thee of! this same shall reign over my people.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>Then Saul drew near to Samuel in the gate, and said, Tell me, I pray thee, where the seer’s house <span class='add'>is</span>.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>And Samuel answered Saul, and said, I <span class='add'>am</span> the seer: go up before me unto the high place; for ye shall eat with me to day, and to morrow I will let thee go, and will tell thee all that <span class='add'>is</span> in thine heart.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>And as for thine asses that were lost three days ago, set not thy mind on them; for they are found. And on whom <span class='add'>is</span> all the desire of Israel? <span class='add'>Is it</span> not on thee, and on all thy father’s house?  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>And Saul answered and said, <span class='add'>Am</span> not I a Benjamite, of the smallest of the tribes of Israel? and my family the least of all the families of the tribe of Benjamin? wherefore then speakest thou so to me?  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>And Samuel took Saul and his servant, and brought them into the parlour, and made them sit in the chiefest place among them that were bidden, which <span class='add'>were</span> about thirty persons.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>And Samuel said unto the cook, Bring the portion which I gave thee, of which I said unto thee, Set it by thee.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>And the cook took up the shoulder, and <span class='add'>that</span> which <span class='add'>was</span> upon it, and set <span class='add'>it</span> before Saul. And <span class='add'>Samuel</span> said, Behold that which is left! set <span class='add'>it</span> before thee, <span class='add'>and</span> eat: for unto this time hath it been kept for thee since I said, I have invited the people. So Saul did eat with Samuel that day. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>And when they were come down from the high place into the city, <span class='add'>Samuel</span> communed with Saul upon the top of the house.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>And they arose early: and it came to pass about the spring of the day, that Samuel called Saul to the top of the house, saying, Up, that I may send thee away. And Saul arose, and they went out both of them, he and Samuel, abroad.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span> <span class='add'>And</span> as they were going down to the end of the city, Samuel said to Saul, Bid the servant pass on before us, (and he passed on,) but stand thou still a while, that I may shew thee the word of God. </div><ul class='tnav'>
