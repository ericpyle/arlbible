<div><a name="C9V0"><hr></a>
<div class="chapterlabel"> 9</div><div class="p">
 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C9V1">&nbsp;</a>Now there was a man of Benjamin, whose name
<span class="add">was</span> Kish, the son of Abiel, the son of Zeror, the son of Bechorath, the son of Aphiah, a Benjamite, a mighty
man of power.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C9V2">&nbsp;</a>And he had a son, whose name
<span class="add">was</span> Saul, a choice young man, and a goodly: and
<span class="add">there was</span> not among the children of Israel a goodlier person than he: from his shoulders and upward
<span class="add">he was</span> higher than any of the people.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C9V3">&nbsp;</a>And the asses of Kish Saul’s father were lost. And Kish said to Saul his son, Take now one of the servants
with thee, and arise, go seek the asses.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C9V4">&nbsp;</a>And he passed through mount Ephraim, and passed through the land of Shalisha, but they found
<span class="add">them</span> not: then they passed through the land of Shalim, and
<span class="add">there they were</span> not: and he passed through the land of the Benjamites, but they found
<span class="add">them</span> not.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C9V5">&nbsp;</a><span class="add">And</span> when they were come to the land of Zuph, Saul said to his servant that
<span class="add">was</span> with him, Come, and let us return; lest my father leave
<span class="add">caring</span> for the asses, and take thought for us.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C9V6">&nbsp;</a>And he said unto him, Behold now,
<span class="add">there is</span> in this city a man of God, and
<span class="add">he is</span> an honourable man; all that he saith cometh surely to pass: now let us go thither; peradventure he can
shew us our way that we should go.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C9V7">&nbsp;</a>Then said Saul to his servant, But, behold,
<span class="add">if</span> we go, what shall we bring the man? for the bread is spent in our vessels, and
<span class="add">there is</span> not a present to bring to the man of God: what have we?
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C9V8">&nbsp;</a>And the servant answered Saul again, and said, Behold, I have here at hand the fourth part of a shekel
of silver:
<span class="add">that</span> will I give to the man of God, to tell us our way.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C9V9">&nbsp;</a>(Beforetime in Israel, when a man went to enquire of God, thus he spake, Come, and let us go to the seer:
for
<span class="add">he that is</span> now
<span class="add">called
</span> a Prophet was beforetime called a Seer.)
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C9V10">&nbsp;</a>Then said Saul to his servant, Well said; come, let us go. So they went unto the city where the man of
God
<span class="add">was.</span></div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C9V11">&nbsp;</a><span class="add">And</span> as they went up the hill to the city, they found young maidens going out to draw water, and said unto
them, Is the seer here?
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C9V12">&nbsp;</a>And they answered them, and said, He is; behold,
<span class="add">he is</span> before you: make haste now, for he came to day to the city; for
<span class="add">there is
</span> a sacrifice of the people to day in the high place:
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C9V13">&nbsp;</a>As soon as ye be come into the city, ye shall straightway find him, before he go up to the high place
to eat: for the people will not eat until he come, because he doth bless the sacrifice;
<span class="add">and</span> afterwards they eat that be bidden. Now therefore get you up; for about this time ye shall find him.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C9V14">&nbsp;</a>And they went up into the city:
<span class="add">and</span> when they were come into the city, behold, Samuel came out against them, for to go up to the high place.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C9V15">&nbsp;</a>Now the LORD had told Samuel in his ear a day before Saul came, saying,
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C9V16">&nbsp;</a>To morrow about this time I will send thee a man out of the land of Benjamin, and thou shalt anoint him
<span class="add">to be</span> captain over my people Israel, that he may save my people out of the hand of the Philistines: for I
have looked upon my people, because their cry is come unto me.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C9V17">&nbsp;</a>And when Samuel saw Saul, the LORD said unto him, Behold the man whom I spake to thee of! this same shall
reign over my people.
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C9V18">&nbsp;</a>Then Saul drew near to Samuel in the gate, and said, Tell me, I pray thee, where the seer’s house
<span class="add">is.
</span> <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C9V19">&nbsp;</a>And Samuel answered Saul, and said, I
<span class="add">am</span> the seer: go up before me unto the high place; for ye shall eat with me to day, and to morrow I will
let thee go, and will tell thee all that
<span class="add">is</span> in thine heart.
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C9V20">&nbsp;</a>And as for thine asses that were lost three days ago, set not thy mind on them; for they are found. And
on whom
<span class="add">is</span> all the desire of Israel?
<span class="add">Is it</span> not on thee, and on all thy father’s house?
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C9V21">&nbsp;</a>And Saul answered and said,
<span class="add">Am</span> not I a Benjamite, of the smallest of the tribes of Israel? and my family the least of all the families
of the tribe of Benjamin? wherefore then speakest thou so to me?
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C9V22">&nbsp;</a>And Samuel took Saul and his servant, and brought them into the parlour, and made them sit in the chiefest
place among them that were bidden, which
<span class="add">were</span> about thirty persons.
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C9V23">&nbsp;</a>And Samuel said unto the cook, Bring the portion which I gave thee, of which I said unto thee, Set it
by thee.
 <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C9V24">&nbsp;</a>And the cook took up the shoulder, and
<span class="add">that</span> which
<span class="add">was
</span> upon it, and set
<span class="add">it</span> before Saul. And
<span class="add">Samuel</span> said, Behold that which is left! set
<span class="add">it</span> before thee,
<span class="add">and</span> eat: for unto this time hath it been kept for thee since I said, I have invited the people. So Saul
did eat with Samuel that day.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C9V25">&nbsp;</a>And when they were come down from the high place into the city,
<span class="add">Samuel</span> communed with Saul upon the top of the house.
 <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C9V26">&nbsp;</a>And they arose early: and it came to pass about the spring of the day, that Samuel called Saul to the
top of the house, saying, Up, that I may send thee away. And Saul arose, and they went out both of them,
he and Samuel, abroad.
 <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C9V27">&nbsp;</a><span class="add">And</span> as they were going down to the end of the city, Samuel said to Saul, Bid the servant pass on before
us, (and he passed on,) but stand thou still a while, that I may shew thee the word of God.
