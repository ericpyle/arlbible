that thy soul be not torn in pieces as a bull <span class='add'>straying alone</span>. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>Thou shalt eat up thy leaves, and lose thy fruit, and leave thyself as a dry tree. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>A wicked soul shall destroy him that hath it, and shall make him to be laughed to scorn of his enemies. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>Sweet language will multiply friends: and a fairspeaking tongue will increase kind greetings. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>Be in peace with many: nevertheless have but one counsellor of a thousand. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>If thou wouldest get a friend, prove him first and be not hasty to credit him. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>For some man is a friend for his own occasion, and will not abide in the day of thy trouble. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>And there is a friend, who being turned to enmity, and strife will discover thy reproach. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>Again, some friend is a companion at the table, and will not continue in the day of thy affliction. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>But in thy prosperity he will be as thyself, and will be bold over thy servants. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>If thou be brought low, he will be against thee, and will hide himself from thy face. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>Separate thyself from thine enemies, and take heed of thy friends. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>A faithfull friend is a strong defence: and he that hath found such an one hath found a treasure. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>Nothing doth countervail a faithful friend, and his excellency is invaluable. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>A faithful friend is the medicine of life;
