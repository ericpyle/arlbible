 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C5V1">&nbsp;</a>And I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the backside,
sealed with seven seals.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C5V2">&nbsp;</a>And I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice, Who is worthy to open the book, and to loose
the seals thereof?
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C5V3">&nbsp;</a>And no man in heaven, nor in earth, neither under the earth, was able to open the book, neither to look
thereon.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C5V4">&nbsp;</a>And I wept much, because no man was found worthy to open and to read the book, neither to look thereon.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C5V5">&nbsp;</a>And one of the elders saith unto me, Weep not: behold, the Lion of the tribe of Juda, the Root of David,
hath prevailed to open the book, and to loose the seven seals thereof.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C5V6">&nbsp;</a>And I beheld, and, lo, in the midst of the throne and of the four beasts, and in the midst of the elders,
stood a Lamb as it had been slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of
God sent forth into all the earth.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C5V7">&nbsp;</a>And he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C5V8">&nbsp;</a>And when he had taken the book, the four beasts and four
<span class="add">and</span> twenty elders fell down before the Lamb, having every one of them harps, and golden vials full of odours,
which are the prayers of saints.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C5V9">&nbsp;</a>And they sung a new song, saying, Thou art worthy to take the book, and to open the seals thereof: for
thou wast slain, and hast redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every kindred, and tongue, and people,
and nation;
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C5V10">&nbsp;</a>And hast made us unto our God kings and priests: and we shall reign on the earth.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C5V11">&nbsp;</a>And I beheld, and I heard the voice of many angels round about the throne and the beasts and the elders:
and the number of them was ten thousand times ten thousand, and thousands of thousands;
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C5V12">&nbsp;</a>Saying with a loud voice, Worthy is the Lamb that was slain to receive power, and riches, and wisdom,
and strength, and honour, and glory, and blessing.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C5V13">&nbsp;</a>And every creature which is in heaven, and on the earth, and under the earth, and such as are in the
sea, and all that are in them, heard I saying, Blessing, and honour, and glory, and power,
<span class="add">be</span> unto him that sitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb for ever and ever.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C5V14">&nbsp;</a>And the four beasts said, Amen. And the four
<span class="add">and</span> twenty elders fell down and worshipped him that liveth for ever and ever.
