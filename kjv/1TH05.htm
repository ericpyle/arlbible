 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C5V1">&nbsp;</a>But of the times and the seasons, brethren, ye have no need that I write unto you.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C5V2">&nbsp;</a>For yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C5V3">&nbsp;</a>For when they shall say, Peace and safety; then sudden destruction cometh upon them, as travail upon
a woman with child; and they shall not escape.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C5V4">&nbsp;</a>But ye, brethren, are not in darkness, that that day should overtake you as a thief.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C5V5">&nbsp;</a>Ye are all the children of light, and the children of the day: we are not of the night, nor of darkness.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C5V6">&nbsp;</a>Therefore let us not sleep, as
<span class="add">do</span> others; but let us watch and be sober.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C5V7">&nbsp;</a>For they that sleep sleep in the night; and they that be drunken are drunken in the night.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C5V8">&nbsp;</a>But let us, who are of the day, be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love; and for an helmet,
the hope of salvation.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C5V9">&nbsp;</a>For God hath not appointed us to wrath, but to obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ,
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C5V10">&nbsp;</a>Who died for us, that, whether we wake or sleep, we should live together with him.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C5V11">&nbsp;</a>Wherefore comfort yourselves together, and edify one another, even as also ye do.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C5V12">&nbsp;</a>And we beseech you, brethren, to know them which labour among you, and are over you in the Lord, and
admonish you;
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C5V13">&nbsp;</a>And to esteem them very highly in love for their work’s sake.
<span class="add">And</span> be at peace among yourselves.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C5V14">&nbsp;</a>Now we exhort you, brethren, warn them that are unruly, comfort the feebleminded, support the weak, be
patient toward all
<span class="add">men.
</span> <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C5V15">&nbsp;</a>See that none render evil for evil unto any
<span class="add">man;</span> but ever follow that which is good, both among yourselves, and to all
<span class="add">men.
</span> <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C5V16">&nbsp;</a>Rejoice evermore.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C5V17">&nbsp;</a>Pray without ceasing.
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C5V18">&nbsp;</a>In every thing give thanks: for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you.
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C5V19">&nbsp;</a>Quench not the Spirit.
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C5V20">&nbsp;</a>Despise not prophesyings.
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C5V21">&nbsp;</a>Prove all things; hold fast that which is good.
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C5V22">&nbsp;</a>Abstain from all appearance of evil.
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C5V23">&nbsp;</a>And the very God of peace sanctify you wholly; and
<span class="add">I pray God
</span> your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.
 <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C5V24">&nbsp;</a>Faithful
<span class="add">is</span> he that calleth you, who also will do
<span class="add">it.
</span></div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C5V25">&nbsp;</a>Brethren, pray for us.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C5V26">&nbsp;</a>Greet all the brethren with an holy kiss.
 <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C5V27">&nbsp;</a>I charge you by the Lord that this epistle be read unto all the holy brethren.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C5V28">&nbsp;</a>The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ
<span class="add">be</span> with you. Amen.
