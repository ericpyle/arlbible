<div class="chapterlabel"> 10</div><div class="p">
 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C10V1">&nbsp;</a>Now after that she had ceased to cry unto the God of Israel, and had made an end of all these words.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C10V2">&nbsp;</a>She rose where she had fallen down, and called her maid, and went down into the house in the which she
abode in the sabbath days, and in her feast days,
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C10V3">&nbsp;</a>And pulled off the sackcloth which she had on, and put off the garments of her widowhood, and washed
her body all over with water, and anointed herself with precious ointment, and braided the hair of her
head, and put on a tire upon it, and put on her garments of gladness, wherewith she was clad during the
life of Manasses her husband.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C10V4">&nbsp;</a>And she took sandals upon her feet, and put about her her bracelets, and her chains, and her rings, and
her earrings, and all her ornaments, and decked herself bravely, to allure the eyes of all men that should
see her.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C10V5">&nbsp;</a>Then she gave her maid a bottle of wine, and a cruse of oil, and filled a bag with parched corn, and
lumps of figs, and with fine bread; so she folded all these things together, and laid them upon her.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C10V6">&nbsp;</a>Thus they went forth to the gate of the city of Bethulia, and found standing there Ozias and the ancients
of the city, Chabris and Charmis.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C10V7">&nbsp;</a>And when they saw her, that her countenance was altered, and her apparel was changed, they wondered at
her beauty very greatly, and said unto her.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C10V8">&nbsp;</a>The God, the God of our fathers give thee favour, and accomplish thine enterprizes to the glory of the
children of Israel, and to the exaltation of Jerusalem. Then they worshipped God.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C10V9">&nbsp;</a>And she said unto them, Command the gates of the city to be opened unto me, that I may go forth to accomplish
the things whereof ye have spoken with me. So they commanded the young men to open unto her, as she had
spoken.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C10V10">&nbsp;</a>And when they had done so, Judith went out, she, and her maid with her; and the men of the city looked
after her, until she was gone down the mountain, and till she had passed the valley, and could see her
no more.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C10V11">&nbsp;</a>Thus they went straight forth in the valley: and the first watch of the Assyrians met her,
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C10V12">&nbsp;</a>And took her, and asked her, Of what people art thou? and whence comest thou? and whither goest thou?
And she said, I am a woman of the Hebrews, and am fled from them: for they shall be given you to be consumed:
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C10V13">&nbsp;</a>And I am coming before Holofernes the chief captain of your army, to declare words of truth; and I will
shew him a way, whereby he shall go, and win all the hill country, without losing the body or life of
any one of his men.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C10V14">&nbsp;</a>Now when the men heard her words, and beheld her countenance, they wondered greatly at her beauty, and
said unto her,
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C10V15">&nbsp;</a>Thou hast saved thy life, in that thou hast hasted to come down to the presence of our lord: now therefore
come to his tent, and some of us shall conduct thee, until they have delivered thee to his hands.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C10V16">&nbsp;</a>And when thou standest before him, be not afraid in thine heart, but shew unto him according to thy word;
and he will entreat thee well.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C10V17">&nbsp;</a>Then they chose out of them an hundred men to accompany her and her maid; and they brought her to the
tent of Holofernes.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C10V18">&nbsp;</a>Then was there a concourse throughout all the camp: for her coming was noised among the tents, and they
came about her, as she stood without the tent of Holofernes, till they told him of her.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C10V19">&nbsp;</a>And they wondered at her beauty, and admired the children of Israel because of her, and every one said
to his neighbour, Who would despise this people, that have among them such women? surely it is not good
that one man of them be left who being let go might deceive the whole earth.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C10V20">&nbsp;</a>And they that lay near Holofernes went out, and all his servants and they brought her into the tent.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C10V21">&nbsp;</a>Now Holofernes rested upon his bed under a canopy, which was woven with purple, and gold, and emeralds,
and precious stones.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C10V22">&nbsp;</a>So they shewed him of her; and he came out before his tent with silver lamps going before him.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C10V23">&nbsp;</a>And when Judith was come before him and his servants they all marvelled at the beauty of her countenance;
and she fell down upon her face, and did reverence unto him: and his servants took her up.
