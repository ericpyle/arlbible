<div class="chapterlabel"> 4</div><div class="p">
 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C4V1">&nbsp;</a>How is the gold become dim!
<span class="add">how</span> is the most fine gold changed! the stones of the sanctuary are poured out in the top of every street.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C4V2">&nbsp;</a>The precious sons of Zion, comparable to fine gold, how are they esteemed as earthen pitchers, the work
of the hands of the potter!
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C4V3">&nbsp;</a>Even the sea monsters draw out the breast, they give suck to their young ones: the daughter of my people
<span class="add">is become</span> cruel, like the ostriches in the wilderness.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C4V4">&nbsp;</a>The tongue of the sucking child cleaveth to the roof of his mouth for thirst: the young children ask
bread,
<span class="add">and</span> no man breaketh
<span class="add">it</span> unto them.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C4V5">&nbsp;</a>They that did feed delicately are desolate in the streets: they that were brought up in scarlet embrace
dunghills.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C4V6">&nbsp;</a>For the punishment of the iniquity of the daughter of my people is greater than the punishment of the
sin of Sodom, that was overthrown as in a moment, and no hands stayed on her.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C4V7">&nbsp;</a>Her Nazarites were purer than snow, they were whiter than milk, they were more ruddy in body than rubies,
their polishing
<span class="add">was</span> of sapphire:
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C4V8">&nbsp;</a>Their visage is blacker than a coal; they are not known in the streets: their skin cleaveth to their
bones; it is withered, it is become like a stick.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C4V9">&nbsp;</a><span class="add">They that be</span> slain with the sword are better than
<span class="add">they that be</span> slain with hunger: for these pine away, stricken through for
<span class="add">want of</span> the fruits of the field.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C4V10">&nbsp;</a>The hands of the pitiful women have sodden their own children: they were their meat in the destruction
of the daughter of my people.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C4V11">&nbsp;</a>The LORD hath accomplished his fury; he hath poured out his fierce anger, and hath kindled a fire in
Zion, and it hath devoured the foundations thereof.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C4V12">&nbsp;</a>The kings of the earth, and all the inhabitants of the world, would not have believed that the adversary
and the enemy should have entered into the gates of Jerusalem.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C4V13">&nbsp;</a>For the sins of her prophets,
<span class="add">and</span> the iniquities of her priests, that have shed the blood of the just in the midst of her,
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C4V14">&nbsp;</a>They have wandered
<span class="add">as</span> blind
<span class="add">men</span> in the streets, they have polluted themselves with blood, so that men could not touch their garments.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C4V15">&nbsp;</a>They cried unto them, Depart ye;
<span class="add">it is</span> unclean; depart, depart, touch not: when they fled away and wandered, they said among the heathen, They
shall no more sojourn
<span class="add">there.
</span> <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C4V16">&nbsp;</a>The anger of the LORD hath divided them; he will no more regard them: they respected not the persons
of the priests, they favoured not the elders.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C4V17">&nbsp;</a>As for us, our eyes as yet failed for our vain help: in our watching we have watched for a nation
<span class="add">that</span> could not save
<span class="add">us.
</span> <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C4V18">&nbsp;</a>They hunt our steps, that we cannot go in our streets: our end is near, our days are fulfilled; for our
end is come.
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C4V19">&nbsp;</a>Our persecutors are swifter than the eagles of the heaven: they pursued us upon the mountains, they laid
wait for us in the wilderness.
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C4V20">&nbsp;</a>The breath of our nostrils, the anointed of the LORD, was taken in their pits, of whom we said, Under
his shadow we shall live among the heathen.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C4V21">&nbsp;</a>Rejoice and be glad, O daughter of Edom, that dwellest in the land of Uz; the cup also shall pass through
unto thee: thou shalt be drunken, and shalt make thyself naked.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C4V22">&nbsp;</a>The punishment of thine iniquity is accomplished, O daughter of Zion; he will no more carry thee away
into captivity: he will visit thine iniquity, O daughter of Edom; he will discover thy sins.
