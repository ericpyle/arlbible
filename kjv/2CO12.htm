 <span class="verse" id="V1">1&nbsp;</span> It is not expedient for me doubtless to glory. I will come to visions and revelations of the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span> I knew a man in Christ above fourteen years ago, (whether in the body, I cannot tell; or whether out of the body, I cannot tell: God knoweth;) such an one caught up to the third heaven.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span> And I knew such a man, (whether in the body, or out of the body, I cannot tell: God knoweth;)  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span> How that he was caught up into paradise, and heard unspeakable words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span> Of such an one will I glory: yet of myself I will not glory, but in mine infirmities.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span> For though I would desire to glory, I shall not be a fool; for I will say the truth: but <span class='add'>now</span> I forbear, lest any man should think of me above that which he seeth me <span class='add'>to be</span>, or <span class='add'>that</span> he heareth of me.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span> And lest I should be exalted above measure through the abundance of the revelations, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, the messenger of Satan to buffet me, lest I should be exalted above measure.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span> For this thing I besought the Lord thrice, that it might depart from me.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span> And he said unto me, <span class='wj'> My grace is sufficient for thee: for my strength is made perfect in weakness.</span> Most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon me.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span> Therefore I take pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches, in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses for Christ’s sake: for when I am weak, then am I strong. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span> I am become a fool in glorying; ye have compelled me: for I ought to have been commended of you: for in nothing am I behind the very chiefest apostles, though I be nothing.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span> Truly the signs of an apostle were wrought among you in all patience, in signs, and wonders, and mighty deeds.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span> For what is it wherein ye were inferior to other churches, except <span class='add'>it be</span> that I myself was not burdensome to you? forgive me this wrong.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span> Behold, the third time I am ready to come to you; and I will not be burdensome to you: for I seek not yours, but you: for the children ought not to lay up for the parents, but the parents for the children.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span> And I will very gladly spend and be spent for you; though the more abundantly I love you, the less I be loved.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span> But be it so, I did not burden you: nevertheless, being crafty, I caught you with guile.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span> Did I make a gain of you by any of them whom I sent unto you?  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span> I desired Titus, and with <span class='add'>him</span> I sent a brother. Did Titus make a gain of you? walked we not in the same spirit? <span class='add'>walked we</span> not in the same steps?  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span> Again, think ye that we excuse ourselves unto you? we speak before God in Christ: but <span class='add'>we do</span> all things, dearly beloved, for your edifying.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span> For I fear, lest, when I come, I shall not find you such as I would, and <span class='add'>that</span> I shall be found unto you such as ye would not: lest <span class='add'>there be</span> debates, envyings, wraths, strifes, backbitings, whisperings, swellings, tumults:  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span> <span class='add'>And</span> lest, when I come again, my God will humble me among you, and <span class='add'>that</span> I shall bewail many which have sinned already, and have not repented of the uncleanness and fornication and lasciviousness which they have committed. </div><ul class='tnav'>
