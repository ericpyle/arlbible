 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C12V1">&nbsp;</a>It is not expedient for me doubtless to glory. I will come to visions and revelations of the Lord.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C12V2">&nbsp;</a>I knew a man in Christ above fourteen years ago, (whether in the body, I cannot tell; or whether out
of the body, I cannot tell: God knoweth;) such an one caught up to the third heaven.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C12V3">&nbsp;</a>And I knew such a man, (whether in the body, or out of the body, I cannot tell: God knoweth;)
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C12V4">&nbsp;</a>How that he was caught up into paradise, and heard unspeakable words, which it is not lawful for a man
to utter.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C12V5">&nbsp;</a>Of such an one will I glory: yet of myself I will not glory, but in mine infirmities.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C12V6">&nbsp;</a>For though I would desire to glory, I shall not be a fool; for I will say the truth: but
<span class="add">now</span> I forbear, lest any man should think of me above that which he seeth me
<span class="add">to be,</span> or
<span class="add">that</span> he heareth of me.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C12V7">&nbsp;</a>And lest I should be exalted above measure through the abundance of the revelations, there was given
to me a thorn in the flesh, the messenger of Satan to buffet me, lest I should be exalted above measure.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C12V8">&nbsp;</a>For this thing I besought the Lord thrice, that it might depart from me.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C12V9">&nbsp;</a>And he said unto me,
<span class="wj">My grace is sufficient for thee: for my strength is made perfect in weakness.</span> Most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon
me.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C12V10">&nbsp;</a>Therefore I take pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches, in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses
for Christ’s sake: for when I am weak, then am I strong.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C12V11">&nbsp;</a>I am become a fool in glorying; ye have compelled me: for I ought to have been commended of you: for
in nothing am I behind the very chiefest apostles, though I be nothing.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C12V12">&nbsp;</a>Truly the signs of an apostle were wrought among you in all patience, in signs, and wonders, and mighty
deeds.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C12V13">&nbsp;</a>For what is it wherein ye were inferior to other churches, except
<span class="add">it be</span> that I myself was not burdensome to you? forgive me this wrong.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C12V14">&nbsp;</a>Behold, the third time I am ready to come to you; and I will not be burdensome to you: for I seek not
yours, but you: for the children ought not to lay up for the parents, but the parents for the children.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C12V15">&nbsp;</a>And I will very gladly spend and be spent for you; though the more abundantly I love you, the less I
be loved.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C12V16">&nbsp;</a>But be it so, I did not burden you: nevertheless, being crafty, I caught you with guile.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C12V17">&nbsp;</a>Did I make a gain of you by any of them whom I sent unto you?
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C12V18">&nbsp;</a>I desired Titus, and with
<span class="add">him</span> I sent a brother. Did Titus make a gain of you? walked we not in the same spirit?
<span class="add">walked we</span> not in the same steps?
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C12V19">&nbsp;</a>Again, think ye that we excuse ourselves unto you? we speak before God in Christ: but
<span class="add">we do</span> all things, dearly beloved, for your edifying.
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C12V20">&nbsp;</a>For I fear, lest, when I come, I shall not find you such as I would, and
<span class="add">that</span> I shall be found unto you such as ye would not: lest
<span class="add">there be</span> debates, envyings, wraths, strifes, backbitings, whisperings, swellings, tumults:
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C12V21">&nbsp;</a><span class="add">And</span> lest, when I come again, my God will humble me among you, and
<span class="add">that</span> I shall bewail many which have sinned already, and have not repented of the uncleanness and fornication
and lasciviousness which they have committed.
