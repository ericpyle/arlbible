 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C23V1">&nbsp;</a>And Balaam said unto Balak, Build me here seven altars, and prepare me here seven oxen and seven rams.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C23V2">&nbsp;</a>And Balak did as Balaam had spoken; and Balak and Balaam offered on
<span class="add">every</span> altar a bullock and a ram.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C23V3">&nbsp;</a>And Balaam said unto Balak, Stand by thy burnt offering, and I will go: peradventure the LORD will come
to meet me: and whatsoever he sheweth me I will tell thee. And he went to an high place.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C23V4">&nbsp;</a>And God met Balaam: and he said unto him, I have prepared seven altars, and I have offered upon
<span class="add">every</span> altar a bullock and a ram.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C23V5">&nbsp;</a>And the LORD put a word in Balaam’s mouth, and said, Return unto Balak, and thus thou shalt speak.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C23V6">&nbsp;</a>And he returned unto him, and, lo, he stood by his burnt sacrifice, he, and all the princes of Moab.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C23V7">&nbsp;</a>And he took up his parable, and said, Balak the king of Moab hath brought me from Aram, out of the mountains
of the east,
<span class="add">saying,</span> Come, curse me Jacob, and come, defy Israel.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C23V8">&nbsp;</a>How shall I curse, whom God hath not cursed? or how shall I defy,
<span class="add">whom</span> the LORD hath not defied?
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C23V9">&nbsp;</a>For from the top of the rocks I see him, and from the hills I behold him: lo, the people shall dwell
alone, and shall not be reckoned among the nations.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C23V10">&nbsp;</a>Who can count the dust of Jacob, and the number of the fourth
<span class="add">part</span> of Israel? Let me die the death of the righteous, and let my last end be like his!
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C23V11">&nbsp;</a>And Balak said unto Balaam, What hast thou done unto me? I took thee to curse mine enemies, and, behold,
thou hast blessed
<span class="add">them</span> altogether.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C23V12">&nbsp;</a>And he answered and said, Must I not take heed to speak that which the LORD hath put in my mouth?
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C23V13">&nbsp;</a>And Balak said unto him, Come, I pray thee, with me unto another place, from whence thou mayest see them:
thou shalt see but the utmost part of them, and shalt not see them all: and curse me them from thence.

<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C23V14">&nbsp;</a>And he brought him into the field of Zophim, to the top of Pisgah, and built seven altars, and offered
a bullock and a ram on
<span class="add">every</span> altar.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C23V15">&nbsp;</a>And he said unto Balak, Stand here by thy burnt offering, while I meet
<span class="add">the LORD</span> yonder.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C23V16">&nbsp;</a>And the LORD met Balaam, and put a word in his mouth, and said, Go again unto Balak, and say thus.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C23V17">&nbsp;</a>And when he came to him, behold, he stood by his burnt offering, and the princes of Moab with him. And
Balak said unto him, What hath the LORD spoken?
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C23V18">&nbsp;</a>And he took up his parable, and said, Rise up, Balak, and hear; hearken unto me, thou son of Zippor:
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C23V19">&nbsp;</a>God
<span class="add">is</span> not a man, that he should lie; neither the son of man, that he should repent: hath he said, and shall
he not do
<span class="add">it?</span> or hath he spoken, and shall he not make it good?
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C23V20">&nbsp;</a>Behold, I have received
<span class="add">commandment</span> to bless: and he hath blessed; and I cannot reverse it.
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C23V21">&nbsp;</a>He hath not beheld iniquity in Jacob, neither hath he seen perverseness in Israel: the LORD his God
<span class="add">is</span> with him, and the shout of a king
<span class="add">is</span> among them.
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C23V22">&nbsp;</a>God brought them out of Egypt; he hath as it were the strength of an unicorn.
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C23V23">&nbsp;</a>Surely
<span class="add">there is</span> no enchantment against Jacob, neither
<span class="add">is there</span> any divination against Israel: according to this time it shall be said of Jacob and of Israel, What
hath God wrought!
 <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C23V24">&nbsp;</a>Behold, the people shall rise up as a great lion, and lift up himself as a young lion: he shall not lie
down until he eat
<span class="add">of</span> the prey, and drink the blood of the slain.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C23V25">&nbsp;</a>And Balak said unto Balaam, Neither curse them at all, nor bless them at all.
 <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C23V26">&nbsp;</a>But Balaam answered and said unto Balak, Told not I thee, saying, All that the LORD speaketh, that I
must do?
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C23V27">&nbsp;</a>And Balak said unto Balaam, Come, I pray thee, I will bring thee unto another place; peradventure it
will please God that thou mayest curse me them from thence.
 <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C23V28">&nbsp;</a>And Balak brought Balaam unto the top of Peor, that looketh toward Jeshimon.
 <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C23V29">&nbsp;</a>And Balaam said unto Balak, Build me here seven altars, and prepare me here seven bullocks and seven
rams.
 <span class="verse"> 30</span><a name="C23V30">&nbsp;</a>And Balak did as Balaam had said, and offered a bullock and a ram on
<span class="add">every</span> altar.
