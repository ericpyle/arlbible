<div class="chapterlabel"> 41</div><div class="p">
 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C41V1">&nbsp;</a>Now it came to pass in the seventh month,
<span class="add">that</span> Ishmael the son of Nethaniah the son of Elishama, of the seed royal, and the princes of the king, even
ten men with him, came unto Gedaliah the son of Ahikam to Mizpah; and there they did eat bread together
in Mizpah.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C41V2">&nbsp;</a>Then arose Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and the ten men that were with him, and smote Gedaliah the son
of Ahikam the son of Shaphan with the sword, and slew him, whom the king of Babylon had made governor
over the land.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C41V3">&nbsp;</a>Ishmael also slew all the Jews that were with him,
<span class="add">even</span> with Gedaliah, at Mizpah, and the Chaldeans that were found there,
<span class="add">and
</span> the men of war.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C41V4">&nbsp;</a>And it came to pass the second day after he had slain Gedaliah, and no man knew
<span class="add">it,
</span> <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C41V5">&nbsp;</a>That there came certain from Shechem, from Shiloh, and from Samaria,
<span class="add">even</span> fourscore men, having their beards shaven, and their clothes rent, and having cut themselves, with offerings
and incense in their hand, to bring
<span class="add">them</span> to the house of the LORD.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C41V6">&nbsp;</a>And Ishmael the son of Nethaniah went forth from Mizpah to meet them, weeping all along as he went: and
it came to pass, as he met them, he said unto them, Come to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C41V7">&nbsp;</a>And it was
<span class="add">so,</span> when they came into the midst of the city, that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah slew them,
<span class="add">and cast them</span> into the midst of the pit, he, and the men that
<span class="add">were</span> with him.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C41V8">&nbsp;</a>But ten men were found among them that said unto Ishmael, Slay us not: for we have treasures in the field,
of wheat, and of barley, and of oil, and of honey. So he forbare, and slew them not among their brethren.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C41V9">&nbsp;</a>Now the pit wherein Ishmael had cast all the dead bodies of the men, whom he had slain because of Gedaliah,
<span class="add">was</span> it which Asa the king had made for fear of Baasha king of Israel:
<span class="add">and</span> Ishmael the son of Nethaniah filled it with
<span class="add">them that were</span> slain.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C41V10">&nbsp;</a>Then Ishmael carried away captive all the residue of the people that
<span class="add">were</span> in Mizpah,
<span class="add">even</span> the king’s daughters, and all the people that remained in Mizpah, whom Nebuzar-adan the captain of the
guard had committed to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam: and Ishmael the son of Nethaniah carried them away
captive, and departed to go over to the Ammonites.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C41V11">&nbsp;</a>But when Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces that
<span class="add">were</span> with him, heard of all the evil that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had done,
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C41V12">&nbsp;</a>Then they took all the men, and went to fight with Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and found him by the
great waters that
<span class="add">are</span> in Gibeon.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C41V13">&nbsp;</a>Now it came to pass,
<span class="add">that</span> when all the people which
<span class="add">were</span> with Ishmael saw Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces that
<span class="add">were</span> with him, then they were glad.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C41V14">&nbsp;</a>So all the people that Ishmael had carried away captive from Mizpah cast about and returned, and went
unto Johanan the son of Kareah.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C41V15">&nbsp;</a>But Ishmael the son of Nethaniah escaped from Johanan with eight men, and went to the Ammonites.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C41V16">&nbsp;</a>Then took Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces that
<span class="add">were</span> with him, all the remnant of the people whom he had recovered from Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, from
Mizpah, after
<span class="add">that
</span> he had slain Gedaliah the son of Ahikam,
<span class="add">even</span> mighty men of war, and the women, and the children, and the eunuchs, whom he had brought again from
Gibeon:
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C41V17">&nbsp;</a>And they departed, and dwelt in the habitation of Chimham, which is by Bethlehem, to go to enter into
Egypt,
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C41V18">&nbsp;</a>Because of the Chaldeans: for they were afraid of them, because Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had slain
Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, whom the king of Babylon made governor in the land.
