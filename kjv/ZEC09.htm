 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C9V1">&nbsp;</a>The burden of the word of the LORD in the land of Hadrach, and Damascus
<span class="add">shall be</span> the rest thereof: when the eyes of man, as of all the tribes of Israel,
<span class="add">shall be</span> toward the LORD.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C9V2">&nbsp;</a>And Hamath also shall border thereby; Tyrus, and Zidon, though it be very wise.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C9V3">&nbsp;</a>And Tyrus did build herself a strong hold, and heaped up silver as the dust, and fine gold as the mire
of the streets.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C9V4">&nbsp;</a>Behold, the Lord will cast her out, and he will smite her power in the sea; and she shall be devoured
with fire.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C9V5">&nbsp;</a>Ashkelon shall see
<span class="add">it,</span> and fear; Gaza also
<span class="add">shall see it,</span> and be very sorrowful, and Ekron; for her expectation shall be ashamed; and the king shall perish from
Gaza, and Ashkelon shall not be inhabited.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C9V6">&nbsp;</a>And a bastard shall dwell in Ashdod, and I will cut off the pride of the Philistines.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C9V7">&nbsp;</a>And I will take away his blood out of his mouth, and his abominations from between his teeth: but he
that remaineth, even he,
<span class="add">shall be</span> for our God, and he shall be as a governor in Judah, and Ekron as a Jebusite.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C9V8">&nbsp;</a>And I will encamp about mine house because of the army, because of him that passeth by, and because of
him that returneth: and no oppressor shall pass through them any more: for now have I seen with mine
eyes.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C9V9">&nbsp;</a>Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion; shout, O daughter of Jerusalem: behold, thy King cometh unto thee:
he
<span class="add">is</span> just, and having salvation; lowly, and riding upon an ass, and upon a colt the foal of an ass.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C9V10">&nbsp;</a>And I will cut off the chariot from Ephraim, and the horse from Jerusalem, and the battle bow shall be
cut off: and he shall speak peace unto the heathen: and his dominion
<span class="add">shall be</span> from sea
<span class="add">even</span> to sea, and from river
<span class="add">even</span> to the ends of the earth.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C9V11">&nbsp;</a>As for thee also, by the blood of thy covenant I have sent forth thy prisoners out of the pit wherein
<span class="add">is</span> no water.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C9V12">&nbsp;</a>Turn you to the strong hold, ye prisoners of hope: even to day do I declare
<span class="add">that</span> I will render double unto thee;
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C9V13">&nbsp;</a>When I have bent Judah for me, filled the bow with Ephraim, and raised up thy sons, O Zion, against thy
sons, O Greece, and made thee as the sword of a mighty man.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C9V14">&nbsp;</a>And the LORD shall be seen over them, and his arrow shall go forth as the lightning: and the LORD GOD
shall blow the trumpet, and shall go with whirlwinds of the south.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C9V15">&nbsp;</a>The LORD of hosts shall defend them; and they shall devour, and subdue with sling stones; and they shall
drink,
<span class="add">and</span> make a noise as through wine; and they shall be filled like bowls,
<span class="add">and</span> as the corners of the altar.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C9V16">&nbsp;</a>And the LORD their God shall save them in that day as the flock of his people: for they
<span class="add">shall be as</span> the stones of a crown, lifted up as an ensign upon his land.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C9V17">&nbsp;</a>For how great
<span class="add">is</span> his goodness, and how great
<span class="add">is</span> his beauty! corn shall make the young men cheerful, and new wine the maids.
