 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C25V1">&nbsp;</a>And Israel abode in Shittim, and the people began to commit whoredom with the daughters of Moab.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C25V2">&nbsp;</a>And they called the people unto the sacrifices of their gods: and the people did eat, and bowed down
to their gods.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C25V3">&nbsp;</a>And Israel joined himself unto Baal-peor: and the anger of the LORD was kindled against Israel.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C25V4">&nbsp;</a>And the LORD said unto Moses, Take all the heads of the people, and hang them up before the LORD against
the sun, that the fierce anger of the LORD may be turned away from Israel.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C25V5">&nbsp;</a>And Moses said unto the judges of Israel, Slay ye every one his men that were joined unto Baal-peor.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C25V6">&nbsp;</a>And, behold, one of the children of Israel came and brought unto his brethren a Midianitish woman in
the sight of Moses, and in the sight of all the congregation of the children of Israel, who
<span class="add">were</span> weeping
<span class="add">before</span> the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C25V7">&nbsp;</a>And when Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, saw
<span class="add">it,</span> he rose up from among the congregation, and took a javelin in his hand;
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C25V8">&nbsp;</a>And he went after the man of Israel into the tent, and thrust both of them through, the man of Israel,
and the woman through her belly. So the plague was stayed from the children of Israel.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C25V9">&nbsp;</a>And those that died in the plague were twenty and four thousand.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C25V10">&nbsp;</a>And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C25V11">&nbsp;</a>Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, hath turned my wrath away from the children
of Israel, while he was zealous for my sake among them, that I consumed not the children of Israel in
my jealousy.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C25V12">&nbsp;</a>Wherefore say, Behold, I give unto him my covenant of peace:
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C25V13">&nbsp;</a>And he shall have it, and his seed after him,
<span class="add">even</span> the covenant of an everlasting priesthood; because he was zealous for his God, and made an atonement
for the children of Israel.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C25V14">&nbsp;</a>Now the name of the Israelite that was slain,
<span class="add">even</span> that was slain with the Midianitish woman,
<span class="add">was</span> Zimri, the son of Salu, a prince of a chief house among the Simeonites.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C25V15">&nbsp;</a>And the name of the Midianitish woman that was slain
<span class="add">was
</span> Cozbi, the daughter of Zur; he
<span class="add">was</span> head over a people,
<span class="add">and</span> of a chief house in Midian.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C25V16">&nbsp;</a>And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C25V17">&nbsp;</a>Vex the Midianites, and smite them:
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C25V18">&nbsp;</a>For they vex you with their wiles, wherewith they have beguiled you in the matter of Peor, and in the
matter of Cozbi, the daughter of a prince of Midian, their sister, which was slain in the day of the
plague for Peor’s sake.
