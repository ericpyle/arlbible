<div class="mt1">The Book of Tobit
</div>
<div class="chapterlabel"> 1</div><div class="p">
 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C1V1">&nbsp;</a>The book of the words of Tobit, son of Tobiel, the son of Ananiel, the son of Aduel, the son of Gabael,
of the seed of Asael, of the tribe of Nephthali;
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C1V2">&nbsp;</a>Who in the time of Enemessar king of the Assyrians was led captive out of Thisbe, which is at the right
hand of that city, which is called properly Nephthali in Galilee above Aser.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C1V3">&nbsp;</a>I Tobit have walked all the days of my life in the ways of truth and justice, and I did many almsdeeds
to my brethren, and my nation, who came with me to Nineve, into the land of the Assyrians.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C1V4">&nbsp;</a>And when I was in mine own country, in the land of Israel being but young, all the tribe of Nephthali
my father fell from the house of Jerusalem, which was chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, that all
the tribes should sacrifice there, where the temple of the habitation of the most High was consecrated
and built for all ages.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C1V5">&nbsp;</a>Now all the tribes which together revolted, and the house of my father Nephthali, sacrificed unto the
heifer Baal.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C1V6">&nbsp;</a>But I alone went often to Jerusalem at the feasts, as it was ordained unto all the people of Israel by
an everlasting decree, having the firstfruits and tenths of increase, with that which was first shorn;
and them gave I at the altar to the priests the children of Aaron.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C1V7">&nbsp;</a>The first tenth part of all increase I gave to the sons of Aaron, who ministered at Jerusalem: another
tenth part I sold away, and went, and spent it every year at Jerusalem:
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C1V8">&nbsp;</a>And the third I gave unto them to whom it was meet, as Debora my father’s mother had commanded me, because
I was left an orphan by my father.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C1V9">&nbsp;</a>Furthermore, when I was come to the age of a man, I married Anna of mine own kindred, and of her I begat
Tobias.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C1V10">&nbsp;</a>And when we were carried away captives to Nineve, all my brethren and those that were of my kindred did
eat of the bread of the Gentiles.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C1V11">&nbsp;</a>But I kept myself from eating;
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C1V12">&nbsp;</a>Because I remembered God with all my heart.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C1V13">&nbsp;</a>And the most High gave me grace and favour before Enemessar, so that I was his purveyor.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C1V14">&nbsp;</a>And I went into Media, and left in trust with Gabael, the brother of Gabrias, at Rages a city of Media
ten talents of silver.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C1V15">&nbsp;</a>Now when Enemessar was dead, Sennacherib his son reigned in his stead; whose estate was troubled, that
I could not go into Media.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C1V16">&nbsp;</a>And in the time of Enemessar I gave many alms to my brethren, and gave my bread to the hungry,
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C1V17">&nbsp;</a>And my clothes to the naked: and if I saw any of my nation dead, or cast about the walls of Nineve, I
buried him.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C1V18">&nbsp;</a>And if the king Sennacherib had slain any, when he was come, and fled from Judea, I buried them privily;
for in his wrath he killed many; but the bodies were not found, when they were sought for of the king.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C1V19">&nbsp;</a>And when one of the Ninevites went and complained of me to the king, that I buried them, and hid myself;
understanding that I was sought for to be put to death, I withdrew myself for fear.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C1V20">&nbsp;</a>Then all my goods were forcibly taken away, neither was there any thing left me, beside my wife Anna
and my son Tobias.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C1V21">&nbsp;</a>And there passed not five and fifty days, before two of his sons killed him, and they fled into the mountains
of Ararath; and Sarchedonus his son reigned in his stead; who appointed over his father’s accounts, and
over all his affairs, Achiacharus my brother Anael’s son.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C1V22">&nbsp;</a>And Achiacharus intreating for me, I returned to Nineve. Now Achiacharus was cupbearer, and keeper of
the signet, and steward, and overseer of the accounts: and Sarchedonus appointed him next unto him: and
he was my brother’s son.
