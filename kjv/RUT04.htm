<div class="chapterlabel"> 4</div><div class="p">
 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C4V1">&nbsp;</a>Then went Boaz up to the gate, and sat him down there: and, behold, the kinsman of whom Boaz spake came
by; unto whom he said, Ho, such a one! turn aside, sit down here. And he turned aside, and sat down.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C4V2">&nbsp;</a>And he took ten men of the elders of the city, and said, Sit ye down here. And they sat down.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C4V3">&nbsp;</a>And he said unto the kinsman, Naomi, that is come again out of the country of Moab, selleth a parcel
of land, which
<span class="add">was</span> our brother Elimelech’s:
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C4V4">&nbsp;</a>And I thought to advertise thee, saying, Buy
<span class="add">it</span> before the inhabitants, and before the elders of my people. If thou wilt redeem
<span class="add">it,</span> redeem
<span class="add">it:</span> but if thou wilt not redeem
<span class="add">it, then
</span> tell me, that I may know: for
<span class="add">there is</span> none to redeem
<span class="add">it</span> beside thee; and I
<span class="add">am</span> after thee. And he said, I will redeem
<span class="add">it.
</span> <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C4V5">&nbsp;</a>Then said Boaz, What day thou buyest the field of the hand of Naomi, thou must buy
<span class="add">it</span> also of Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of the dead, to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C4V6">&nbsp;</a>And the kinsman said, I cannot redeem
<span class="add">it</span> for myself, lest I mar mine own inheritance: redeem thou my right to thyself; for I cannot redeem it.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C4V7">&nbsp;</a>Now this
<span class="add">was the manner</span> in former time in Israel concerning redeeming and concerning changing, for to confirm all things; a
man plucked off his shoe, and gave
<span class="add">it</span> to his neighbour: and this
<span class="add">was
</span> a testimony in Israel.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C4V8">&nbsp;</a>Therefore the kinsman said unto Boaz, Buy
<span class="add">it</span> for thee. So he drew off his shoe.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C4V9">&nbsp;</a>And Boaz said unto the elders, and
<span class="add">unto</span> all the people, Ye
<span class="add">are</span> witnesses this day, that I have bought all that
<span class="add">was
</span> Elimelech’s, and all that
<span class="add">was</span> Chilion’s and Mahlon’s, of the hand of Naomi.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C4V10">&nbsp;</a>Moreover Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of Mahlon, have I purchased to be my wife, to raise up the name
of the dead upon his inheritance, that the name of the dead be not cut off from among his brethren, and
from the gate of his place: ye
<span class="add">are</span> witnesses this day.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C4V11">&nbsp;</a>And all the people that
<span class="add">were</span> in the gate, and the elders, said,
<span class="add">We are</span> witnesses. The LORD make the woman that is come into thine house like Rachel and like Leah, which two
did build the house of Israel: and do thou worthily in Ephratah, and be famous in Bethlehem:
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C4V12">&nbsp;</a>And let thy house be like the house of Pharez, whom Tamar bare unto Judah, of the seed which the LORD
shall give thee of this young woman.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C4V13">&nbsp;</a>So Boaz took Ruth, and she was his wife: and when he went in unto her, the LORD gave her conception,
and she bare a son.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C4V14">&nbsp;</a>And the women said unto Naomi, Blessed
<span class="add">be</span> the LORD, which hath not left thee this day without a kinsman, that his name may be famous in Israel.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C4V15">&nbsp;</a>And he shall be unto thee a restorer of
<span class="add">thy</span> life, and a nourisher of thine old age: for thy daughter in law, which loveth thee, which is better
to thee than seven sons, hath born him.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C4V16">&nbsp;</a>And Naomi took the child, and laid it in her bosom, and became nurse unto it.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C4V17">&nbsp;</a>And the women her neighbours gave it a name, saying, There is a son born to Naomi; and they called his
name Obed: he
<span class="add">is</span> the father of Jesse, the father of David.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C4V18">&nbsp;</a>Now these
<span class="add">are</span> the generations of Pharez: Pharez begat Hezron,
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C4V19">&nbsp;</a>And Hezron begat Ram, and Ram begat Amminadab,
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C4V20">&nbsp;</a>And Amminadab begat Nahshon, and Nahshon begat Salmon,
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C4V21">&nbsp;</a>And Salmon begat Boaz, and Boaz begat Obed,
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C4V22">&nbsp;</a>And Obed begat Jesse, and Jesse begat David.
