 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C39V1">&nbsp;</a>And Joseph was brought down to Egypt; and Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh, captain of the guard, an Egyptian,
bought him of the hands of the Ishmeelites, which had brought him down thither.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C39V2">&nbsp;</a>And the LORD was with Joseph, and he was a prosperous man; and he was in the house of his master the
Egyptian.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C39V3">&nbsp;</a>And his master saw that the LORD
<span class="add">was</span> with him, and that the LORD made all
<span class="add">that</span> he did to prosper in his hand.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C39V4">&nbsp;</a>And Joseph found grace in his sight, and he served him: and he made him overseer over his house, and
all that he had he put into his hand.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C39V5">&nbsp;</a>And it came to pass from the time
<span class="add">that</span> he had made him overseer in his house, and over all that he had, that the LORD blessed the Egyptian’s
house for Joseph’s sake; and the blessing of the LORD was upon all that he had in the house, and in the
field.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C39V6">&nbsp;</a>And he left all that he had in Joseph’s hand; and he knew not ought he had, save the bread which he did
eat. And Joseph was
<span class="add">a</span> goodly
<span class="add">person,</span> and well favoured.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C39V7">&nbsp;</a>And it came to pass after these things, that his master’s wife cast her eyes upon Joseph; and she said,
Lie with me.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C39V8">&nbsp;</a>But he refused, and said unto his master’s wife, Behold, my master wotteth not what
<span class="add">is</span> with me in the house, and he hath committed all that he hath to my hand;
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C39V9">&nbsp;</a><span class="add">There is</span> none greater in this house than I; neither hath he kept back any thing from me but thee, because thou
<span class="add">art</span> his wife: how then can I do this great wickedness, and sin against God?
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C39V10">&nbsp;</a>And it came to pass, as she spake to Joseph day by day, that he hearkened not unto her, to lie by her,
<span class="add">or</span> to be with her.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C39V11">&nbsp;</a>And it came to pass about this time, that
<span class="add">Joseph</span> went into the house to do his business; and
<span class="add">there was</span> none of the men of the house there within.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C39V12">&nbsp;</a>And she caught him by his garment, saying, Lie with me: and he left his garment in her hand, and fled,
and got him out.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C39V13">&nbsp;</a>And it came to pass, when she saw that he had left his garment in her hand, and was fled forth,
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C39V14">&nbsp;</a>That she called unto the men of her house, and spake unto them, saying, See, he hath brought in an Hebrew
unto us to mock us; he came in unto me to lie with me, and I cried with a loud voice:
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C39V15">&nbsp;</a>And it came to pass, when he heard that I lifted up my voice and cried, that he left his garment with
me, and fled, and got him out.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C39V16">&nbsp;</a>And she laid up his garment by her, until his lord came home.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C39V17">&nbsp;</a>And she spake unto him according to these words, saying, The Hebrew servant, which thou hast brought
unto us, came in unto me to mock me:
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C39V18">&nbsp;</a>And it came to pass, as I lifted up my voice and cried, that he left his garment with me, and fled out.
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C39V19">&nbsp;</a>And it came to pass, when his master heard the words of his wife, which she spake unto him, saying, After
this manner did thy servant to me; that his wrath was kindled.
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C39V20">&nbsp;</a>And Joseph’s master took him, and put him into the prison, a place where the king’s prisoners
<span class="add">were</span> bound: and he was there in the prison.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C39V21">&nbsp;</a>But the LORD was with Joseph, and shewed him mercy, and gave him favour in the sight of the keeper of
the prison.
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C39V22">&nbsp;</a>And the keeper of the prison committed to Joseph’s hand all the prisoners that
<span class="add">were</span> in the prison; and whatsoever they did there, he was the doer
<span class="add">of it.
</span> <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C39V23">&nbsp;</a>The keeper of the prison looked not to any thing
<span class="add">that was
</span> under his hand; because the LORD was with him, and
<span class="add">that</span> which he did, the LORD made
<span class="add">it</span> to prosper.
