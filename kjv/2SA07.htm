 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C7V1">&nbsp;</a>And it came to pass, when the king sat in his house, and the LORD had given him rest round about from
all his enemies;
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C7V2">&nbsp;</a>That the king said unto Nathan the prophet, See now, I dwell in an house of cedar, but the ark of God
dwelleth within curtains.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C7V3">&nbsp;</a>And Nathan said to the king, Go, do all that
<span class="add">is</span> in thine heart; for the LORD
<span class="add">is</span> with thee.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C7V4">&nbsp;</a>And it came to pass that night, that the word of the LORD came unto Nathan, saying,
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C7V5">&nbsp;</a>Go and tell my servant David, Thus saith the LORD, Shalt thou build me an house for me to dwell in?
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C7V6">&nbsp;</a>Whereas I have not dwelt in
<span class="add">any</span> house since the time that I brought up the children of Israel out of Egypt, even to this day, but have
walked in a tent and in a tabernacle.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C7V7">&nbsp;</a>In all
<span class="add">the places</span> wherein I have walked with all the children of Israel spake I a word with any of the tribes of Israel,
whom I commanded to feed my people Israel, saying, Why build ye not me an house of cedar?
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C7V8">&nbsp;</a>Now therefore so shalt thou say unto my servant David, Thus saith the LORD of hosts, I took thee from
the sheepcote, from following the sheep, to be ruler over my people, over Israel:
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C7V9">&nbsp;</a>And I was with thee whithersoever thou wentest, and have cut off all thine enemies out of thy sight,
and have made thee a great name, like unto the name of the great
<span class="add">men</span> that
<span class="add">are</span> in the earth.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C7V10">&nbsp;</a>Moreover I will appoint a place for my people Israel, and will plant them, that they may dwell in a place
of their own, and move no more; neither shall the children of wickedness afflict them any more, as beforetime,
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C7V11">&nbsp;</a>And as since the time that I commanded judges
<span class="add">to be</span> over my people Israel, and have caused thee to rest from all thine enemies. Also the LORD telleth thee
that he will make thee an house.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C7V12">&nbsp;</a>And when thy days be fulfilled, and thou shalt sleep with thy fathers, I will set up thy seed after thee,
which shall proceed out of thy bowels, and I will establish his kingdom.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C7V13">&nbsp;</a>He shall build an house for my name, and I will stablish the throne of his kingdom for ever.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C7V14">&nbsp;</a>I will be his father, and he shall be my son. If he commit iniquity, I will chasten him with the rod
of men, and with the stripes of the children of men:
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C7V15">&nbsp;</a>But my mercy shall not depart away from him, as I took
<span class="add">it
</span> from Saul, whom I put away before thee.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C7V16">&nbsp;</a>And thine house and thy kingdom shall be established for ever before thee: thy throne shall be established
for ever.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C7V17">&nbsp;</a>According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so did Nathan speak unto David.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C7V18">&nbsp;</a>Then went king David in, and sat before the LORD, and he said, Who
<span class="add">am</span> I, O Lord GOD? and what
<span class="add">is</span> my house, that thou hast brought me hitherto?
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C7V19">&nbsp;</a>And this was yet a small thing in thy sight, O Lord GOD; but thou hast spoken also of thy servant’s house
for a great while to come. And
<span class="add">is
</span> this the manner of man, O Lord GOD?
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C7V20">&nbsp;</a>And what can David say more unto thee? for thou, Lord GOD, knowest thy servant.
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C7V21">&nbsp;</a>For thy word’s sake, and according to thine own heart, hast thou done all these great things, to make
thy servant know
<span class="add">them.
</span> <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C7V22">&nbsp;</a>Wherefore thou art great, O LORD God: for
<span class="add">there is</span> none like thee, neither
<span class="add">is there any</span> God beside thee, according to all that we have heard with our ears.
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C7V23">&nbsp;</a>And what one nation in the earth
<span class="add">is</span> like thy people,
<span class="add">even</span> like Israel, whom God went to redeem for a people to himself, and to make him a name, and to do for
you great things and terrible, for thy land, before thy people, which thou redeemedst to thee from Egypt,
<span class="add">from
</span> the nations and their gods?
 <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C7V24">&nbsp;</a>For thou hast confirmed to thyself thy people Israel
<span class="add">to be
</span> a people unto thee for ever: and thou, LORD, art become their God.
 <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C7V25">&nbsp;</a>And now, O LORD God, the word that thou hast spoken concerning thy servant, and concerning his house,
establish
<span class="add">it</span> for ever, and do as thou hast said.
 <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C7V26">&nbsp;</a>And let thy name be magnified for ever, saying, The LORD of hosts
<span class="add">is</span> the God over Israel: and let the house of thy servant David be established before thee.
 <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C7V27">&nbsp;</a>For thou, O LORD of hosts, God of Israel, hast revealed to thy servant, saying, I will build thee an
house: therefore hath thy servant found in his heart to pray this prayer unto thee.
 <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C7V28">&nbsp;</a>And now, O Lord GOD, thou
<span class="add">art</span> that God, and thy words be true, and thou hast promised this goodness unto thy servant:
 <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C7V29">&nbsp;</a>Therefore now let it please thee to bless the house of thy servant, that it may continue for ever before
thee: for thou, O Lord GOD, hast spoken
<span class="add">it:</span> and with thy blessing let the house of thy servant be blessed for ever.
