there arose up an high priest clothed with doctrine and truth.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 41</span><a name="C5V41">&nbsp;</a>So of Israel, from them of twelve years old and upward, they were all in number forty thousand, beside

<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 44</span><a name="C5V44">&nbsp;</a>And certain of the chief of their families, when they came to the temple of God that is in Jerusalem,
vowed to set up the house again in his own place according to their ability,
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 45</span><a name="C5V45">&nbsp;</a>And to give into the holy treasury of the works a thousand pounds of gold, five thousand of silver, and
an hundred priestly vestments.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 46</span><a name="C5V46">&nbsp;</a>And so dwelt the priests and the Levites and the people in Jerusalem, and in the country, the singers
also and the porters; and all Israel in their villages.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 47</span><a name="C5V47">&nbsp;</a>But when the seventh month was at hand, and when the children of Israel were every man in his own place,
they came all together with one consent into the open place of the first gate which is toward the east.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 48</span><a name="C5V48">&nbsp;</a>Then stood up Jesus the son of Josedec, and his brethren the priests and Zorobabel the son of Salathiel,
and his brethren, and made ready the altar of the God of Israel,
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 49</span><a name="C5V49">&nbsp;</a>To offer burnt sacrifices upon it, according as it is expressly commanded in the book of Moses the man
of God.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 50</span><a name="C5V50">&nbsp;</a>And there were gathered unto them out of the other nations of the land, and they erected the altar upon
his own place, because all the nations of the land were at enmity with them, and oppressed them; and
they offered sacrifices according to the time, and burnt offerings to the Lord both morning and evening.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 51</span><a name="C5V51">&nbsp;</a>Also they held the feast of tabernacles, as it is commanded in the law, and offered sacrifices daily,
as was meet:
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 52</span><a name="C5V52">&nbsp;</a>And after that, the continual oblations, and the sacrifice of the sabbaths, and of the new moons, and
of all holy feasts.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 53</span><a name="C5V53">&nbsp;</a>And all they that had made any vow to God began to offer sacrifices to God from the first day of the
seventh month, although the temple of the Lord was not yet built.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 54</span><a name="C5V54">&nbsp;</a>And they gave unto the masons and carpenters money, meat, and drink, with cheerfulness.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 55</span><a name="C5V55">&nbsp;</a>Unto them of Zidon also and Tyre they gave carrs, that they should bring cedar trees from Libanus, which
should be brought by floats to the haven of Joppa, according as it was commanded them by Cyrus king of
the Persians.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 56</span><a name="C5V56">&nbsp;</a>And in the second year and second month after his coming to the temple of God at Jerusalem began Zorobabel
the son of Salathiel, and Jesus the son of Josedec, and their brethren, and the priests, and the Levites,
and all they that were come unto Jerusalem out of the captivity:
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 57</span><a name="C5V57">&nbsp;</a>And they laid the foundation of the house of God in the first day of the second month, in the second
year after they were come to Jewry and Jerusalem.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 58</span><a name="C5V58">&nbsp;</a>And they appointed the Levites from twenty years old over the works of the Lord. Then stood up Jesus,
and his sons and brethren, and Cadmiel his brother, and the sons of Madiabun, with the sons of Joda the
son of Eliadun, with their sons and brethren, all Levites, with one accord setters forward of the business,
labouring to advance the works in the house of God. So the workmen built the temple of the Lord.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 59</span><a name="C5V59">&nbsp;</a>And the priests stood arrayed in their vestments with musical instruments and trumpets; and the Levites
the sons of Asaph had cymbals,
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 60</span><a name="C5V60">&nbsp;</a>Singing songs of thanksgiving, and praising the Lord, according as David the king of Israel had ordained.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 61</span><a name="C5V61">&nbsp;</a>And they sung with loud voices songs to the praise of the Lord, because his mercy and glory is for ever
in all Israel.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 62</span><a name="C5V62">&nbsp;</a>And all the people sounded trumpets, and shouted with a loud voice, singing songs of thanksgiving unto
the Lord for the rearing up of the house of the Lord.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 63</span><a name="C5V63">&nbsp;</a>Also of the priests and Levites, and of the chief of their families, the ancients who had seen the former
house came to the building of this with weeping and great crying.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 64</span><a name="C5V64">&nbsp;</a>But many with trumpets and joy shouted with loud voice,
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 65</span><a name="C5V65">&nbsp;</a>Insomuch that the trumpets might not be heard for the weeping of the people: yet the multitude sounded
marvellously, so that it was heard afar off.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 66</span><a name="C5V66">&nbsp;</a>Wherefore when the enemies of the tribe of Judah and Benjamin heard it, they came to know what that noise
of trumpets should mean.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 67</span><a name="C5V67">&nbsp;</a>And they perceived that they that were of the captivity did build the temple unto the Lord God of Israel.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 68</span><a name="C5V68">&nbsp;</a>So they went to Zorobabel and Jesus, and to the chief of the families, and said unto them, We will build
together with you.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 69</span><a name="C5V69">&nbsp;</a>For we likewise, as ye, do obey your Lord, and do sacrifice unto him from the days of Azbazareth the
king of the Assyrians, who brought us hither.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 70</span><a name="C5V70">&nbsp;</a>Then Zorobabel and Jesus and the chief of the families of Israel said unto them, It is not for us and
you to build together an house unto the Lord our God.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 71</span><a name="C5V71">&nbsp;</a>We ourselves alone will build unto the Lord of Israel, according as Cyrus the king of the Persians hath
commanded us.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 72</span><a name="C5V72">&nbsp;</a>But the heathen of the land lying heavy upon the inhabitants of Judea, and holding them strait, hindered
their building;
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 73</span><a name="C5V73">&nbsp;</a>And by their secret plots, and popular persuasions and commotions, they hindered the finishing of the
building all the time that king Cyrus lived: so they were hindered from building for the space of two
years, until the reign of Darius.
