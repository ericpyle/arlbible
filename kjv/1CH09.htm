 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C9V1">&nbsp;</a>So all Israel were reckoned by genealogies; and, behold, they

</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C9V2">&nbsp;</a>Now the first inhabitants that

</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C9V27">&nbsp;</a>And they lodged round about the house of God, because the charge

<span class="add">were</span> appointed to oversee the vessels, and all the instruments of the sanctuary, and the fine flour, and
the wine, and the oil, and the frankincense, and the spices.
 <span class="verse"> 30</span><a name="C9V30">&nbsp;</a>And
<span class="add">some</span> of the sons of the priests made the ointment of the spices.

<span class="add">were</span> over the shewbread, to prepare
<span class="add">it</span> every sabbath.
 <span class="verse"> 33</span><a name="C9V33">&nbsp;</a>And these
<span class="add">are</span> the singers, chief of the fathers of the Levites,

<span class="add">were</span> free: for they were employed in that work day and night.
 <span class="verse"> 34</span><a name="C9V34">&nbsp;</a>These chief fathers of the Levites
<span class="add">were</span> chief throughout their generations; these dwelt at Jerusalem.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 35</span><a name="C9V35">&nbsp;</a>And in Gibeon dwelt the father of Gibeon, Jehiel, whose wife’s name

 <span class="verse"> 36</span><a name="C9V36">&nbsp;</a>And his firstborn son Abdon, then Zur, and Kish, and Baal, and Ner, and Nadab,
 <span class="verse"> 37</span><a name="C9V37">&nbsp;</a>And Gedor, and Ahio, and Zechariah, and Mikloth.
