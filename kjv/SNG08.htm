 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C8V1">&nbsp;</a>O that thou
<span class="add">wert</span> as my brother, that sucked the breasts of my mother!
<span class="add">when</span> I should find thee without, I would kiss thee; yea, I should not be despised.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C8V2">&nbsp;</a>I would lead thee,
<span class="add">and</span> bring thee into my mother’s house,
<span class="add">who</span> would instruct me: I would cause thee to drink of spiced wine of the juice of my pomegranate.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C8V3">&nbsp;</a>His left hand
<span class="add">should be</span> under my head, and his right hand should embrace me.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C8V4">&nbsp;</a>I charge you, O daughters of Jerusalem, that ye stir not up, nor awake
<span class="add">my</span> love, until he please.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C8V5">&nbsp;</a>Who
<span class="add">is</span> this that cometh up from the wilderness, leaning upon her beloved? I raised thee up under the apple
tree: there thy mother brought thee forth: there she brought thee forth
<span class="add">that</span> bare thee.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C8V6">&nbsp;</a>Set me as a seal upon thine heart, as a seal upon thine arm: for love
<span class="add">is</span> strong as death; jealousy
<span class="add">is</span> cruel as the grave: the coals thereof
<span class="add">are</span> coals of fire,
<span class="add">which hath a</span> most vehement flame.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C8V7">&nbsp;</a>Many waters cannot quench love, neither can the floods drown it: if
<span class="add">a</span> man would give all the substance of his house for love, it would utterly be contemned.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C8V8">&nbsp;</a>We have a little sister, and she hath no breasts: what shall we do for our sister in the day when she
shall be spoken for?
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C8V9">&nbsp;</a>If she
<span class="add">be</span> a wall, we will build upon her a palace of silver: and if she
<span class="add">be</span> a door, we will inclose her with boards of cedar.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C8V10">&nbsp;</a>I
<span class="add">am</span> a wall, and my breasts like towers: then was I in his eyes as one that found favour.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C8V11">&nbsp;</a>Solomon had a vineyard at Baal-hamon; he let out the vineyard unto keepers; every one for the fruit thereof
was to bring a thousand
<span class="add">pieces
</span> of silver.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C8V12">&nbsp;</a>My vineyard, which
<span class="add">is</span> mine,
<span class="add">is</span> before me: thou, O Solomon,
<span class="add">must have</span> a thousand, and those that keep the fruit thereof two hundred.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C8V13">&nbsp;</a>Thou that dwellest in the gardens, the companions hearken to thy voice: cause me to hear
<span class="add">it.</span></div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C8V14">&nbsp;</a>Make haste, my beloved, and be thou like to a roe or to a young hart upon the mountains of spices.
