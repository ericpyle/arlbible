 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C5V1">&nbsp;</a>It is reported commonly
<span class="add">that there is</span> fornication among you, and such fornication as is not so much as named among the Gentiles, that one
should have his father’s wife.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C5V2">&nbsp;</a>And ye are puffed up, and have not rather mourned, that he that hath done this deed might be taken away
from among you.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C5V3">&nbsp;</a>For I verily, as absent in body, but present in spirit, have judged already, as though I were present,
<span class="add">concerning</span> him that hath so done this deed,
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C5V4">&nbsp;</a>In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, when ye are gathered together, and my spirit, with the power of
our Lord Jesus Christ,
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C5V5">&nbsp;</a>To deliver such an one unto Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the
day of the Lord Jesus.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C5V6">&nbsp;</a>Your glorying
<span class="add">is</span> not good. Know ye not that a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump?
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C5V7">&nbsp;</a>Purge out therefore the old leaven, that ye may be a new lump, as ye are unleavened. For even Christ
our passover is sacrificed for us:
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C5V8">&nbsp;</a>Therefore let us keep the feast, not with old leaven, neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness;
but with the unleavened
<span class="add">bread</span> of sincerity and truth.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C5V9">&nbsp;</a>I wrote unto you in an epistle not to company with fornicators:
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C5V10">&nbsp;</a>Yet not altogether with the fornicators of this world, or with the covetous, or extortioners, or with
idolaters; for then must ye needs go out of the world.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C5V11">&nbsp;</a>But now I have written unto you not to keep company, if any man that is called a brother be a fornicator,
or covetous, or an idolater, or a railer, or a drunkard, or an extortioner; with such an one no not to
eat.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C5V12">&nbsp;</a>For what have I to do to judge them also that are without? do not ye judge them that are within?
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C5V13">&nbsp;</a>But them that are without God judgeth. Therefore put away from among yourselves that wicked person.
