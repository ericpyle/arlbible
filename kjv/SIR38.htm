 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C38V1">&nbsp;</a>Honour a physician with the honour due unto him for the uses which ye may have of him: for the Lord hath
created him.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C38V2">&nbsp;</a>For of the most High cometh healing, and he shall receive honour of the king.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C38V3">&nbsp;</a>The skill of the physician shall lift up his head: and in the sight of great men he shall be in admiration.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C38V4">&nbsp;</a>The Lord hath created medicines out of the earth; and he that is wise will not abhor them.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C38V5">&nbsp;</a>Was not the water made sweet with wood, that the virtue thereof might be known?
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C38V6">&nbsp;</a>And he hath given men skill, that he might be honoured in his marvellous works.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C38V7">&nbsp;</a>With such doth he heal
<span class="add">men,</span> and taketh away their pains.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C38V8">&nbsp;</a>Of such doth the apothecary make a confection; and of his works there is no end; and from him is peace
over all the earth,
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C38V9">&nbsp;</a>My son, in thy sickness be not negligent: but pray unto the Lord, and he will make thee whole.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C38V10">&nbsp;</a>Leave off from sin, and order thine hands aright, and cleanse thy heart from all wickedness.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C38V11">&nbsp;</a>Give a sweet savour, and a memorial of fine flour; and make a fat offering, as not being.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C38V12">&nbsp;</a>Then give place to the physician, for the Lord hath created him: let him not go from thee, for thou hast
need of him.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C38V13">&nbsp;</a>There is a time when in their hands there is good success.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C38V14">&nbsp;</a>For they shall also pray unto the Lord, that he would prosper that, which they give for ease and remedy
to prolong life.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C38V15">&nbsp;</a>He that sinneth before his Maker, let him fall into the hand of the physician.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C38V16">&nbsp;</a>My son, let tears fall down over the dead, and begin to lament, as if thou hadst suffered great harm
thyself; and then cover his body according to the custom, and neglect not his burial.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C38V17">&nbsp;</a>Weep bitterly, and make great moan, and use lamentation, as he is worthy, and that a day or two, lest
thou be evil spoken of: and then comfort thyself for thy heaviness.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C38V18">&nbsp;</a>For of heaviness cometh death, and the heaviness of the heart breaketh strength.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C38V19">&nbsp;</a>In affliction also sorrow remaineth: and the life of the poor is the curse of the heart.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C38V20">&nbsp;</a>Take no heaviness to heart: drive it away, and member the last end.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C38V21">&nbsp;</a>Forget it not, for there is no turning again: thou shalt not do him good, but hurt thyself.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C38V22">&nbsp;</a>Remember my judgment: for thine also shall be so; yesterday for me, and to day for thee.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C38V23">&nbsp;</a>When the dead is at rest, let his remembrance rest; and be comforted for him, when his Spirit is departed
from him.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C38V24">&nbsp;</a>The wisdom of a learned man cometh by opportunity of leisure: and he that hath little business shall
become wise.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C38V25">&nbsp;</a>How can he get wisdom that holdeth the plough, and that glorieth in the goad, that driveth oxen, and
is occupied in their labours, and whose talk is of bullocks?
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C38V26">&nbsp;</a>He giveth his mind to make furrows; and is diligent to give the kine fodder.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C38V27">&nbsp;</a>So every carpenter and workmaster, that laboureth night and day: and they that cut and grave seals, and
are diligent to make great variety, and give themselves to counterfeit imagery, and watch to finish a
work:
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C38V28">&nbsp;</a>The smith also sitting by the anvil, and considering the iron work, the vapour of the fire wasteth his
flesh, and he fighteth with the heat of the furnace: the noise of the hammer and the anvil is ever in
his ears, and his eyes look still upon the pattern of the thing that he maketh; he setteth his mind to
finish his work, and watcheth to polish it perfectly:
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C38V29">&nbsp;</a>So doth the potter sitting at his work, and turning the wheel about with his feet, who is alway carefully
set at his work, and maketh all his work by number;
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 30</span><a name="C38V30">&nbsp;</a>He fashioneth the clay with his arm, and boweth down his strength before his feet; he applieth himself
to lead it over; and he is diligent to make clean the furnace:
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 31</span><a name="C38V31">&nbsp;</a>All these trust to their hands: and every one is wise in his work.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 32</span><a name="C38V32">&nbsp;</a>Without these cannot a city be inhabited: and they shall not dwell where they will, nor go up and down:
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 33</span><a name="C38V33">&nbsp;</a>They shall not be sought for in publick counsel, nor sit high in the congregation: they shall not sit
on the judges’ seat, nor understand the sentence of judgment: they cannot declare justice and judgment;
and they shall not be found where parables are spoken.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 34</span><a name="C38V34">&nbsp;</a>But they will maintain the state of the world, and
<span class="add">all</span> their desire is in the work of their craft.
