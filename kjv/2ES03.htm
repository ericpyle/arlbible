<div class="chapterlabel"> 3</div><div class="p">
 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C3V1">&nbsp;</a>In the thirtieth year after the ruin of the city I was in Babylon, and lay troubled upon my bed, and
my thoughts came up over my heart:
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C3V2">&nbsp;</a>For I saw the desolation of Sion, and the wealth of them that dwelt at Babylon.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C3V3">&nbsp;</a>And my spirit was sore moved, so that I began to speak words full of fear to the most High, and said,
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C3V4">&nbsp;</a>O Lord, who bearest rule, thou spakest at the beginning, when thou didst plant the earth, and that thyself
alone, and commandedst the people,
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C3V5">&nbsp;</a>And gavest a body unto Adam without soul, which was the workmanship of thine hands, and didst breathe
into him the breath of life, and he was made living before thee.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C3V6">&nbsp;</a>And thou leadest him into paradise, which thy right hand had planted, before ever the earth came forward.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C3V7">&nbsp;</a>And unto him thou gavest commandment to love thy way: which he transgressed, and immediately thou appointedst
death in him and in his generations, of whom came nations, tribes, people, and kindreds, out of number.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C3V8">&nbsp;</a>And every people walked after their own will, and did wonderful things before thee, and despised thy
commandments.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C3V9">&nbsp;</a>And again in process of time thou broughtest the flood upon those that dwelt in the world, and destroyedst
them.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C3V10">&nbsp;</a>And it came to pass in every of them, that as death was to Adam, so was the flood to these.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C3V11">&nbsp;</a>Nevertheless one of them thou leftest, namely, Noah with his household, of whom came all righteous men.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C3V12">&nbsp;</a>And it happened, that when they that dwelt upon the earth began to multiply, and had gotten them many
children, and were a great people, they began again to be more ungodly than the first.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C3V13">&nbsp;</a>Now when they lived so wickedly before thee, thou didst choose thee a man from among them, whose name
was Abraham.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C3V14">&nbsp;</a>Him thou lovedst, and unto him only thou shewedst thy will:
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C3V15">&nbsp;</a>And madest an everlasting covenant with him, promising him that thou wouldest never forsake his seed.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C3V16">&nbsp;</a>And unto him thou gavest Isaac, and unto Isaac also thou gavest Jacob and Esau. As for Jacob, thou didst
choose him to thee, and put by Esau: and so Jacob became a great multitude.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C3V17">&nbsp;</a>And it came to pass, that when thou leadest his seed out of Egypt, thou broughtest them up to the mount
Sinai.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C3V18">&nbsp;</a>And bowing the heavens, thou didst set fast the earth, movedst the whole world, and madest the depths
to tremble, and troubledst the men of that age.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C3V19">&nbsp;</a>And thy glory went through four gates, of fire, and of earthquake, and of wind, and of cold; that thou
mightest give the law unto the seed of Jacob, and diligence unto the generation of Israel.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C3V20">&nbsp;</a>And yet tookest thou not away from them a wicked heart, that thy law might bring forth fruit in them.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C3V21">&nbsp;</a>For the first Adam bearing a wicked heart transgressed, and was overcome; and so be all they that are
born of him.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C3V22">&nbsp;</a>Thus infirmity was made permanent; and the law (also) in the heart of the people with the malignity of
the root; so that the good departed away, and the evil abode still.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C3V23">&nbsp;</a>So the times passed away, and the years were brought to an end: then didst thou raise thee up a servant,
called David:
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C3V24">&nbsp;</a>Whom thou commandedst to build a city unto thy name, and to offer incense and oblations unto thee therein.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C3V25">&nbsp;</a>When this was done many years, then they that inhabited the city forsook thee,
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C3V26">&nbsp;</a>And in all things did even as Adam and all his generations had done: for they also had a wicked heart:
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C3V27">&nbsp;</a>And so thou gavest thy city over into the hands of thine enemies.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C3V28">&nbsp;</a>Are their deeds then any better that inhabit Babylon, that they should therefore have the dominion over
Sion?
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C3V29">&nbsp;</a>For when I came thither, and had seen impieties without number, then my soul saw many evildoers in this
thirtieth year, so that my heart failed me.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 30</span><a name="C3V30">&nbsp;</a>For I have seen how thou sufferest them sinning, and hast spared wicked doers: and hast destroyed thy
people, and hast preserved thine enemies, and hast not signified it.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 31</span><a name="C3V31">&nbsp;</a>I do not remember how this way may be left: Are they then of Babylon better than they of Sion?
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 32</span><a name="C3V32">&nbsp;</a>Or is there any other people that knoweth thee beside Israel? or what generation hath so believed thy
covenants as Jacob?
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 33</span><a name="C3V33">&nbsp;</a>And yet their reward appeareth not, and their labour hath no fruit: for I have gone here and there through
the heathen, and I see that they flow in wealth, and think not upon thy commandments.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 34</span><a name="C3V34">&nbsp;</a>Weigh thou therefore our wickedness now in the balance, and their’s also that dwell the world; and so
shall thy name no where be found but in Israel.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 35</span><a name="C3V35">&nbsp;</a>Or when was it that they which dwell upon the earth have not sinned in thy sight? or what people have
so kept thy commandments?
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 36</span><a name="C3V36">&nbsp;</a>Thou shalt find that Israel by name hath kept thy precepts; but not the heathen.
