 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C15V1">&nbsp;</a>And straightway in the morning the chief priests held a consultation with the elders and scribes and
the whole council, and bound Jesus, and carried
<span class="add">him</span> away, and delivered
<span class="add">him</span> to Pilate.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C15V2">&nbsp;</a>And Pilate asked him, Art thou the King of the Jews? And he answering said unto him,
<span class="wj">Thou sayest
it.
</span> <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C15V3">&nbsp;</a>And the chief priests accused him of many things: but he answered nothing.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C15V4">&nbsp;</a>And Pilate asked him again, saying, Answerest thou nothing? behold how many things they witness against
thee.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C15V5">&nbsp;</a>But Jesus yet answered nothing; so that Pilate marvelled.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C15V6">&nbsp;</a>Now at
<span class="add">that</span> feast he released unto them one prisoner, whomsoever they desired.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C15V7">&nbsp;</a>And there was
<span class="add">one</span> named Barabbas,
<span class="add">which lay</span> bound with them that had made insurrection with him, who had committed murder in the insurrection.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C15V8">&nbsp;</a>And the multitude crying aloud began to desire
<span class="add">him to do</span> as he had ever done unto them.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C15V9">&nbsp;</a>But Pilate answered them, saying, Will ye that I release unto you the King of the Jews?
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C15V10">&nbsp;</a>For he knew that the chief priests had delivered him for envy.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C15V11">&nbsp;</a>But the chief priests moved the people, that he should rather release Barabbas unto them.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C15V12">&nbsp;</a>And Pilate answered and said again unto them, What will ye then that I shall do
<span class="add">unto him</span> whom ye call the King of the Jews?
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C15V13">&nbsp;</a>And they cried out again, Crucify him.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C15V14">&nbsp;</a>Then Pilate said unto them, Why, what evil hath he done? And they cried out the more exceedingly, Crucify
him.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C15V15">&nbsp;</a>And
<span class="add">so</span> Pilate, willing to content the people, released Barabbas unto them, and delivered Jesus, when he had
scourged
<span class="add">him,</span> to be crucified.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C15V16">&nbsp;</a>And the soldiers led him away into the hall, called Praetorium; and they call together the whole band.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C15V17">&nbsp;</a>And they clothed him with purple, and platted a crown of thorns, and put it about his
<span class="add">head,
</span> <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C15V18">&nbsp;</a>And began to salute him, Hail, King of the Jews!
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C15V19">&nbsp;</a>And they smote him on the head with a reed, and did spit upon him, and bowing
<span class="add">their</span> knees worshipped him.
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C15V20">&nbsp;</a>And when they had mocked him, they took off the purple from him, and put his own clothes on him, and
led him out to crucify him.
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C15V21">&nbsp;</a>And they compel one Simon a Cyrenian, who passed by, coming out of the country, the father of Alexander
and Rufus, to bear his cross.
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C15V22">&nbsp;</a>And they bring him unto the place Golgotha, which is, being interpreted, The place of a skull.
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C15V23">&nbsp;</a>And they gave him to drink wine mingled with myrrh: but he received
<span class="add">it</span> not.
 <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C15V24">&nbsp;</a>And when they had crucified him, they parted his garments, casting lots upon them, what every man should
take.
 <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C15V25">&nbsp;</a>And it was the third hour, and they crucified him.
 <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C15V26">&nbsp;</a>And the superscription of his accusation was written over, THE KING OF THE JEWS.
 <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C15V27">&nbsp;</a>And with him they crucify two thieves; the one on his right hand, and the other on his left.
 <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C15V28">&nbsp;</a>And the scripture was fulfilled, which saith, And he was numbered with the transgressors.
 <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C15V29">&nbsp;</a>And they that passed by railed on him, wagging their heads, and saying, Ah, thou that destroyest the
temple, and buildest
<span class="add">it</span> in three days,
 <span class="verse"> 30</span><a name="C15V30">&nbsp;</a>Save thyself, and come down from the cross.
 <span class="verse"> 31</span><a name="C15V31">&nbsp;</a>Likewise also the chief priests mocking said among themselves with the scribes, He saved others; himself
he cannot save.
 <span class="verse"> 32</span><a name="C15V32">&nbsp;</a>Let Christ the King of Israel descend now from the cross, that we may see and believe. And they that
were crucified with him reviled him.
 <span class="verse"> 33</span><a name="C15V33">&nbsp;</a>And when the sixth hour was come, there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour.
 <span class="verse"> 34</span><a name="C15V34">&nbsp;</a>And at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying,
<span class="wj">Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?</span> which is, being interpreted,
<span class="wj">My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?
</span> <span class="verse"> 35</span><a name="C15V35">&nbsp;</a>And some of them that stood by, when they heard
<span class="add">it,</span> said, Behold, he calleth Elias.
 <span class="verse"> 36</span><a name="C15V36">&nbsp;</a>And one ran and filled a spunge full of vinegar, and put
<span class="add">it</span> on a reed, and gave him to drink, saying, Let alone; let us see whether Elias will come to take him
down.
 <span class="verse"> 37</span><a name="C15V37">&nbsp;</a>And Jesus cried with a loud voice, and gave up the ghost.
 <span class="verse"> 38</span><a name="C15V38">&nbsp;</a>And the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 39</span><a name="C15V39">&nbsp;</a>And when the centurion, which stood over against him, saw that he so cried out, and gave up the ghost,
he said, Truly this man was the Son of God.
 <span class="verse"> 40</span><a name="C15V40">&nbsp;</a>There were also women looking on afar off: among whom was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James
the less and of Joses, and Salome;
 <span class="verse"> 41</span><a name="C15V41">&nbsp;</a>(Who also, when he was in Galilee, followed him, and ministered unto him;) and many other women which
came up with him unto Jerusalem.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 42</span><a name="C15V42">&nbsp;</a>And now when the even was come, because it was the preparation, that is, the day before the sabbath,
 <span class="verse"> 43</span><a name="C15V43">&nbsp;</a>Joseph of Arimathaea, an honourable counsellor, which also waited for the kingdom of God, came, and went
in boldly unto Pilate, and craved the body of Jesus.
 <span class="verse"> 44</span><a name="C15V44">&nbsp;</a>And Pilate marvelled if he were already dead: and calling
<span class="add">unto him</span> the centurion, he asked him whether he had been any while dead.
 <span class="verse"> 45</span><a name="C15V45">&nbsp;</a>And when he knew
<span class="add">it</span> of the centurion, he gave the body to Joseph.
 <span class="verse"> 46</span><a name="C15V46">&nbsp;</a>And he bought fine linen, and took him down, and wrapped him in the linen, and laid him in a sepulchre
which was hewn out of a rock, and rolled a stone unto the door of the sepulchre.
 <span class="verse"> 47</span><a name="C15V47">&nbsp;</a>And Mary Magdalene and Mary
<span class="add">the mother</span> of Joses beheld where he was laid.
