 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C3V1">&nbsp;</a>For this cause I Paul, the prisoner of Jesus Christ for you Gentiles,
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C3V2">&nbsp;</a>If ye have heard of the dispensation of the grace of God which is given me to youward:
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C3V3">&nbsp;</a>How that by revelation he made known unto me the mystery; (as I wrote afore in few words,
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C3V4">&nbsp;</a>Whereby, when ye read, ye may understand my knowledge in the mystery of Christ)
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C3V5">&nbsp;</a>Which in other ages was not made known unto the sons of men, as it is now revealed unto his holy apostles
and prophets by the Spirit;
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C3V6">&nbsp;</a>That the Gentiles should be fellowheirs, and of the same body, and partakers of his promise in Christ
by the gospel:
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C3V7">&nbsp;</a>Whereof I was made a minister, according to the gift of the grace of God given unto me by the effectual
working of his power.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C3V8">&nbsp;</a>Unto me, who am less than the least of all saints, is this grace given, that I should preach among the
Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ;
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C3V9">&nbsp;</a>And to make all
<span class="add">men</span> see what
<span class="add">is</span> the fellowship of the mystery, which from the beginning of the world hath been hid in God, who created
all things by Jesus Christ:
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C3V10">&nbsp;</a>To the intent that now unto the principalities and powers in heavenly
<span class="add">places</span> might be known by the church the manifold wisdom of God,
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C3V11">&nbsp;</a>According to the eternal purpose which he purposed in Christ Jesus our Lord:
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C3V12">&nbsp;</a>In whom we have boldness and access with confidence by the faith of him.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C3V13">&nbsp;</a>Wherefore I desire that ye faint not at my tribulations for you, which is your glory.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C3V14">&nbsp;</a>For this cause I bow my knees unto the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C3V15">&nbsp;</a>Of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named,
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C3V16">&nbsp;</a>That he would grant you, according to the riches of his glory, to be strengthened with might by his Spirit
in the inner man;
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C3V17">&nbsp;</a>That Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith; that ye, being rooted and grounded in love,
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C3V18">&nbsp;</a>May be able to comprehend with all saints what
<span class="add">is</span> the breadth, and length, and depth, and height;
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C3V19">&nbsp;</a>And to know the love of Christ, which passeth knowledge, that ye might be filled with all the fulness
of God.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C3V20">&nbsp;</a>Now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the
power that worketh in us,
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C3V21">&nbsp;</a>Unto him
<span class="add">be</span> glory in the church by Christ Jesus throughout all ages, world without end. Amen.
