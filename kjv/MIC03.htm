 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C3V1">&nbsp;</a>And I said, Hear, I pray you, O heads of Jacob, and ye princes of the house of Israel;
<span class="add">Is it</span> not for you to know judgment?
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C3V2">&nbsp;</a>Who hate the good, and love the evil; who pluck off their skin from off them, and their flesh from off
their bones;
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C3V3">&nbsp;</a>Who also eat the flesh of my people, and flay their skin from off them; and they break their bones, and
chop them in pieces, as for the pot, and as flesh within the caldron.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C3V4">&nbsp;</a>Then shall they cry unto the LORD, but he will not hear them: he will even hide his face from them at
that time, as they have behaved themselves ill in their doings.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C3V5">&nbsp;</a>Thus saith the LORD concerning the prophets that make my people err, that bite with their teeth, and
cry, Peace; and he that putteth not into their mouths, they even prepare war against him.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C3V6">&nbsp;</a>Therefore night
<span class="add">shall be</span> unto you, that ye shall not have a vision; and it shall be dark unto you, that ye shall not divine;
and the sun shall go down over the prophets, and the day shall be dark over them.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C3V7">&nbsp;</a>Then shall the seers be ashamed, and the diviners confounded: yea, they shall all cover their lips; for
<span class="add">there is</span> no answer of God.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C3V8">&nbsp;</a>But truly I am full of power by the spirit of the LORD, and of judgment, and of might, to declare unto
Jacob his transgression, and to Israel his sin.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C3V9">&nbsp;</a>Hear this, I pray you, ye heads of the house of Jacob, and princes of the house of Israel, that abhor
judgment, and pervert all equity.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C3V10">&nbsp;</a>They build up Zion with blood, and Jerusalem with iniquity.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C3V11">&nbsp;</a>The heads thereof judge for reward, and the priests thereof teach for hire, and the prophets thereof
divine for money: yet will they lean upon the LORD, and say,
<span class="add">Is</span> not the LORD among us? none evil can come upon us.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C3V12">&nbsp;</a>Therefore shall Zion for your sake be plowed
<span class="add">as</span> a field, and Jerusalem shall become heaps, and the mountain of the house as the high places of the forest.
