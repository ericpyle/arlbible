 <span class="verse" id="V1">1&nbsp;</span>Moreover the spirit lifted me up, and brought me unto the east gate of the LORD’s house, which looketh eastward: and behold at the door of the gate five and twenty men; among whom I saw Jaazaniah the son of Azur, and Pelatiah the son of Benaiah, the princes of the people.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span>Then said he unto me, Son of man, these <span class='add'>are</span> the men that devise mischief, and give wicked counsel in this city:  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>Which say, <span class='add'>It is</span> not near; let us build houses: this <span class='add'>city is</span> the caldron, and we <span class='add'>be</span> the flesh. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>Therefore prophesy against them, prophesy, O son of man.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>And the Spirit of the LORD fell upon me, and said unto me, Speak; Thus saith the LORD; Thus have ye said, O house of Israel: for I know the things that come into your mind, <span class='add'>every one of</span> them.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>Ye have multiplied your slain in this city, and ye have filled the streets thereof with the slain.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Your slain whom ye have laid in the midst of it, they <span class='add'>are</span> the flesh, and this <span class='add'>city is</span> the caldron: but I will bring you forth out of the midst of it.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>Ye have feared the sword; and I will bring a sword upon you, saith the Lord GOD.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>And I will bring you out of the midst thereof, and deliver you into the hands of strangers, and will execute judgments among you.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>Ye shall fall by the sword; I will judge you in the border of Israel; and ye shall know that I <span class='add'>am</span> the LORD.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>This <span class='add'>city</span> shall not be your caldron, neither shall ye be the flesh in the midst thereof; <span class='add'>but</span> I will judge you in the border of Israel:  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>And ye shall know that I <span class='add'>am</span> the LORD: for ye have not walked in my statutes, neither executed my judgments, but have done after the manners of the heathen that <span class='add'>are</span> round about you. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>And it came to pass, when I prophesied, that Pelatiah the son of Benaiah died. Then fell I down upon my face, and cried with a loud voice, and said, Ah Lord GOD! wilt thou make a full end of the remnant of Israel?  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>Again the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>Son of man, thy brethren, <span class='add'>even</span> thy brethren, the men of thy kindred, and all the house of Israel wholly, <span class='add'>are</span> they unto whom the inhabitants of Jerusalem have said, Get you far from the LORD: unto us is this land given in possession.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>Therefore say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Although I have cast them far off among the heathen, and although I have scattered them among the countries, yet will I be to them as a little sanctuary in the countries where they shall come.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>Therefore say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; I will even gather you from the people, and assemble you out of the countries where ye have been scattered, and I will give you the land of Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>And they shall come thither, and they shall take away all the detestable things thereof and all the abominations thereof from thence.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>And I will give them one heart, and I will put a new spirit within you; and I will take the stony heart out of their flesh, and will give them an heart of flesh:  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>That they may walk in my statutes, and keep mine ordinances, and do them: and they shall be my people, and I will be their God.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>But <span class='add'>as for them</span> whose heart walketh after the heart of their detestable things and their abominations, I will recompense their way upon their own heads, saith the Lord GOD. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>Then did the cherubims lift up their wings, and the wheels beside them; and the glory of the God of Israel <span class='add'>was</span> over them above.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>And the glory of the LORD went up from the midst of the city, and stood upon the mountain which <span class='add'>is</span> on the east side of the city. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>Afterwards the spirit took me up, and brought me in a vision by the Spirit of God into Chaldea, to them of the captivity.
