 <span class="verse" id="V1">1&nbsp;</span> Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ:  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span> By whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand, and rejoice in hope of the glory of God.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span> And not only <span class='add'>so</span>, but we glory in tribulations also: knowing that tribulation worketh patience;  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span> And patience, experience; and experience, hope:  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span> And hope maketh not ashamed; because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span> For when we were yet without strength, in due time Christ died for the ungodly.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span> For scarcely for a righteous man will one die: yet peradventure for a good man some would even dare to die.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span> But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span> Much more then, being now justified by his blood, we shall be saved from wrath through him.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span> For if, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, much more, being reconciled, we shall be saved by his life.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span> And not only <span class='add'>so</span>, but we also joy in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom we have now received the atonement. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span> Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned:  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>(For until the law sin was in the world: but sin is not imputed when there is no law.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span> Nevertheless death reigned from Adam to Moses , even over them that had not sinned after the similitude of Adam’s transgression, who is the figure of him that was to come.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span> But not as the offence, so also <span class='add'>is</span> the free gift. For if through the offence of one many be dead, much more the grace of God, and the gift by grace, <span class='add'>which is</span> by one man, Jesus Christ, hath abounded unto many.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span> And not as <span class='add'>it was</span> by one that sinned, <span class='add'>so is</span> the gift: for the judgment <span class='add'>was</span> by one to condemnation, but the free gift <span class='add'>is</span> of many offences unto justification.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span> For if by one man’s offence death reigned by one; much more they which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one, Jesus Christ.)  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span> Therefore as by the offence of one <span class='add'>judgment came</span> upon all men to condemnation; even so by the righteousness of one <span class='add'>the free gift came</span> upon all men unto justification of life.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span> For as by one man’s disobedience many were made sinners, so by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span> Moreover the law entered, that the offence might abound. But where sin abounded, grace did much more abound:  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span> That as sin hath reigned unto death, even so might  grace reign through righteousness unto eternal life by Jesus Christ our Lord. </div><ul class='tnav'>
