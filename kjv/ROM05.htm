 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C5V1">&nbsp;</a>Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ:
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C5V2">&nbsp;</a>By whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand, and rejoice in hope of the glory
of God.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C5V3">&nbsp;</a>And not only
<span class="add">so,</span> but we glory in tribulations also: knowing that tribulation worketh patience;
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C5V4">&nbsp;</a>And patience, experience; and experience, hope:
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C5V5">&nbsp;</a>And hope maketh not ashamed; because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which
is given unto us.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C5V6">&nbsp;</a>For when we were yet without strength, in due time Christ died for the ungodly.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C5V7">&nbsp;</a>For scarcely for a righteous man will one die: yet peradventure for a good man some would even dare to
die.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C5V8">&nbsp;</a>But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C5V9">&nbsp;</a>Much more then, being now justified by his blood, we shall be saved from wrath through him.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C5V10">&nbsp;</a>For if, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, much more, being reconciled,
we shall be saved by his life.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C5V11">&nbsp;</a>And not only
<span class="add">so,</span> but we also joy in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom we have now received the atonement.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C5V12">&nbsp;</a>Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men,
for that all have sinned:
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C5V13">&nbsp;</a>(For until the law sin was in the world: but sin is not imputed when there is no law.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C5V14">&nbsp;</a>Nevertheless death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over them that had not sinned after the similitude
of Adam’s transgression, who is the figure of him that was to come.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C5V15">&nbsp;</a>But not as the offence, so also
<span class="add">is</span> the free gift. For if through the offence of one many be dead, much more the grace of God, and the gift
by grace,
<span class="add">which is</span> by one man, Jesus Christ, hath abounded unto many.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C5V16">&nbsp;</a>And not as
<span class="add">it was</span> by one that sinned,
<span class="add">so is</span> the gift: for the judgment
<span class="add">was</span> by one to condemnation, but the free gift
<span class="add">is</span> of many offences unto justification.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C5V17">&nbsp;</a>For if by one man’s offence death reigned by one; much more they which receive abundance of grace and
of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one, Jesus Christ.)
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C5V18">&nbsp;</a>Therefore as by the offence of one
<span class="add">judgment came</span> upon all men to condemnation; even so by the righteousness of one
<span class="add">the free gift came</span> upon all men unto justification of life.
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C5V19">&nbsp;</a>For as by one man’s disobedience many were made sinners, so by the obedience of one shall many be made
righteous.
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C5V20">&nbsp;</a>Moreover the law entered, that the offence might abound. But where sin abounded, grace did much more
abound:
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C5V21">&nbsp;</a>That as sin hath reigned unto death, even so might grace reign through righteousness unto eternal life
by Jesus Christ our Lord.
