<div class="chapterlabel"> 10</div><div class="p">
 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C10V1">&nbsp;</a>Now Maccabeus and his company, the Lord guiding them, recovered the temple and the city:
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C10V2">&nbsp;</a>But the altars which the heathen had built in the open street, and also the chapels, they pulled down.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C10V3">&nbsp;</a>And having cleansed the temple they made another altar, and striking stones they took fire out of them,
and offered a sacrifice after two years, and set forth incense, and lights, and shewbread.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C10V4">&nbsp;</a>When that was done, they fell flat down, and besought the Lord that they might come no more into such
troubles; but if they sinned any more against him, that he himself would chasten them with mercy, and
that they might not be delivered unto the blasphemous and barbarous nations.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C10V5">&nbsp;</a>Now upon the same day that the strangers profaned the temple, on the very same day it was cleansed again,
even the five and twentieth day of the same month, which is Casleu.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C10V6">&nbsp;</a>And they kept the eight days with gladness, as in the feast of the tabernacles, remembering that not
long afore they had held the feast of the tabernacles, when as they wandered in the mountains and dens
like beasts.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C10V7">&nbsp;</a>Therefore they bare branches, and fair boughs, and palms also, and sang psalms unto him that had given
them good success in cleansing his place.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C10V8">&nbsp;</a>They ordained also by a common statute and decree, That every year those days should be kept of the whole
nation of the Jews.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C10V9">&nbsp;</a>And this was the end of Antiochus, called Epiphanes.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C10V10">&nbsp;</a>Now will we declare the acts of Antiochus Eupator, who was the son of this wicked man, gathering briefly
the calamities of the wars.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C10V11">&nbsp;</a>So when he was come to the crown, he set one Lysias over the affairs of his realm, and appointed him
his chief governor of Celosyria and Phenice.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C10V12">&nbsp;</a>For Ptolemeus, that was called Macron, choosing rather to do justice unto the Jews for the wrong that
had been done unto them, endeavoured to continue peace with them.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C10V13">&nbsp;</a>Whereupon being accused of the king’s friends before Eupator, and called traitor at every word because
he had left Cyprus, that Philometor had committed unto him, and departed to Antiochus Epiphanes, and
seeing that he was in no honourable place, he was so discouraged, that he poisoned himself and died.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C10V14">&nbsp;</a>But when Gorgias was governor of the holds, he hired soldiers, and nourished war continually with the
Jews:
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C10V15">&nbsp;</a>And therewithall the Idumeans, having gotten into their hands the most commodious holds, kept the Jews
occupied, and receiving those that were banished from Jerusalem, they went about to nourish war.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C10V16">&nbsp;</a>Then they that were with Maccabeus made supplication, and besought God that he would be their helper;
and so they ran with violence upon the strong holds of the Idumeans,
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C10V17">&nbsp;</a>And assaulting them strongly, they won the holds, and kept off all that fought upon the wall, and slew
all that fell into their hands, and killed no fewer than twenty thousand.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C10V18">&nbsp;</a>And because certain, who were no less than nine thousand, were fled together into two very strong castles,
having all manner of things convenient to sustain the siege,
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C10V19">&nbsp;</a>Maccabeus left Simon and Joseph, and Zaccheus also, and them that were with him, who were enough to besiege
them, and departed himself unto those places which more needed his help.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C10V20">&nbsp;</a>Now they that were with Simon, being led with covetousness, were persuaded for money through certain
of those that were in the castle, and took seventy thousand drachms, and let some of them escape.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C10V21">&nbsp;</a>But when it was told Maccabeus what was done, he called the governors of the people together, and accused
those men, that they had sold their brethren for money, and set their enemies free to fight against them.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C10V22">&nbsp;</a>So he slew those that were found traitors, and immediately took the two castles.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C10V23">&nbsp;</a>And having good success with his weapons in all things he took in hand, he slew in the two holds more
than twenty thousand.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C10V24">&nbsp;</a>Now Timotheus, whom the Jews had overcome before, when he had gathered a great multitude of foreign forces,
and horses out of Asia not a few, came as though he would take Jewry by force of arms.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C10V25">&nbsp;</a>But when he drew near, they that were with Maccabeus turned themselves to pray unto God, and sprinkled
earth upon their heads, and girded their loins with sackcloth,
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C10V26">&nbsp;</a>And fell down at the foot of the altar, and besought him to be merciful to them, and to be an enemy to
their enemies, and an adversary to their adversaries, as the law declareth.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C10V27">&nbsp;</a>So after the prayer they took their weapons, and went on further from the city: and when they drew near
to their enemies, they kept by themselves.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C10V28">&nbsp;</a>Now the sun being newly risen, they joined both together; the one part having together with their virtue
their refuge also unto the Lord for a pledge of their success and victory: the other side making their
rage leader of their battle
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C10V29">&nbsp;</a>But when the battle waxed strong, there appeared unto the enemies from heaven five comely men upon horses,
with bridles of gold, and two of them led the Jews,
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 30</span><a name="C10V30">&nbsp;</a>And took Maccabeus betwixt them, and covered him on every side weapons, and kept him safe, but shot arrows
and lightnings against the enemies: so that being confounded with blindness, and full of trouble, they
were killed.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 31</span><a name="C10V31">&nbsp;</a>And there were slain of footmen twenty thousand and five hundred, and six hundred horsemen.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 32</span><a name="C10V32">&nbsp;</a>As for Timotheus himself, he fled into a very strong hold, called Gawra, where Chereas was governor.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 33</span><a name="C10V33">&nbsp;</a>But they that were with Maccabeus laid siege against the fortress courageously four days.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 34</span><a name="C10V34">&nbsp;</a>And they that were within, trusting to the strength of the place, blasphemed exceedingly, and uttered
wicked words.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 35</span><a name="C10V35">&nbsp;</a>Nevertheless upon the fifth day early twenty young men of Maccabeus’ company, inflamed with anger because
of the blasphemies, assaulted the wall manly, and with a fierce courage killed all that they met withal.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 36</span><a name="C10V36">&nbsp;</a>Others likewise ascending after them, whiles they were busied with them that were within, burnt the towers,
and kindling fires burnt the blasphemers alive; and others broke open the gates, and, having received
in the rest of the army, took the city,
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 37</span><a name="C10V37">&nbsp;</a>And killed Timotheus, that was hid in a certain pit, and Chereas his brother, with Apollophanes.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 38</span><a name="C10V38">&nbsp;</a>When this was done, they praised the Lord with psalms and thanksgiving, who had done so great things
for Israel, and given them the victory.
