 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C10V1">&nbsp;</a>And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C10V2">&nbsp;</a>Make thee two trumpets of silver; of a whole piece shalt thou make them: that thou mayest use them for
the calling of the assembly, and for the journeying of the camps.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C10V3">&nbsp;</a>And when they shall blow with them, all the assembly shall assemble themselves to thee at the door of
the tabernacle of the congregation.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C10V4">&nbsp;</a>And if they blow
<span class="add">but</span> with one
<span class="add">trumpet,</span> then the princes,
<span class="add">which are</span> heads of the thousands of Israel, shall gather themselves unto thee.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C10V5">&nbsp;</a>When ye blow an alarm, then the camps that lie on the east parts shall go forward.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C10V6">&nbsp;</a>When ye blow an alarm the second time, then the camps that lie on the south side shall take their journey:
they shall blow an alarm for their journeys.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C10V7">&nbsp;</a>But when the congregation is to be gathered together, ye shall blow, but ye shall not sound an alarm.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C10V8">&nbsp;</a>And the sons of Aaron, the priests, shall blow with the trumpets; and they shall be to you for an ordinance
for ever throughout your generations.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C10V9">&nbsp;</a>And if ye go to war in your land against the enemy that oppresseth you, then ye shall blow an alarm with
the trumpets; and ye shall be remembered before the LORD your God, and ye shall be saved from your enemies.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C10V10">&nbsp;</a>Also in the day of your gladness, and in your solemn days, and in the beginnings of your months, ye shall
blow with the trumpets over your burnt offerings, and over the sacrifices of your peace offerings; that
they may be to you for a memorial before your God: I
<span class="add">am</span> the LORD your God.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C10V11">&nbsp;</a>And it came to pass on the twentieth
<span class="add">day</span> of the second month, in the second year, that the cloud was taken up from off the tabernacle of the
testimony.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C10V12">&nbsp;</a>And the children of Israel took their journeys out of the wilderness of Sinai; and the cloud rested in
the wilderness of Paran.

</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C10V29">&nbsp;</a>And Moses said unto Hobab, the son of Raguel the Midianite, Moses’ father in law, We are journeying unto
the place of which the LORD said, I will give it you: come thou with us, and we will do thee good: for
the LORD hath spoken good concerning Israel.
 <span class="verse"> 30</span><a name="C10V30">&nbsp;</a>And he said unto him, I will not go; but I will depart to mine own land, and to my kindred.
 <span class="verse"> 31</span><a name="C10V31">&nbsp;</a>And he said, Leave us not, I pray thee; forasmuch as thou knowest how we are to encamp in the wilderness,
and thou mayest be to us instead of eyes.
 <span class="verse"> 32</span><a name="C10V32">&nbsp;</a>And it shall be, if thou go with us, yea, it shall be, that what goodness the LORD shall do unto us,
the same will we do unto thee.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 33</span><a name="C10V33">&nbsp;</a>And they departed from the mount of the LORD three days’ journey: and the ark of the covenant of the
LORD went before them in the three days’ journey, to search out a resting place for them.
 <span class="verse"> 34</span><a name="C10V34">&nbsp;</a>And the cloud of the LORD
<span class="add">was</span> upon them by day, when they went out of the camp.
 <span class="verse"> 35</span><a name="C10V35">&nbsp;</a>And it came to pass, when the ark set forward, that Moses said, Rise up, LORD, and let thine enemies
be scattered; and let them that hate thee flee before thee.
 <span class="verse"> 36</span><a name="C10V36">&nbsp;</a>And when it rested, he said, Return, O LORD, unto the many thousands of Israel.
