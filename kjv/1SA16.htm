 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C16V1">&nbsp;</a>And the LORD said unto Samuel, How long wilt thou mourn for Saul, seeing I have rejected him from reigning
over Israel? fill thine horn with oil, and go, I will send thee to Jesse the Bethlehemite: for I have
provided me a king among his sons.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C16V2">&nbsp;</a>And Samuel said, How can I go? if Saul hear
<span class="add">it,</span> he will kill me. And the LORD said, Take an heifer with thee, and say, I am come to sacrifice to the
LORD.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C16V3">&nbsp;</a>And call Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will shew thee what thou shalt do: and thou shalt anoint unto
me
<span class="add">him</span> whom I name unto thee.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C16V4">&nbsp;</a>And Samuel did that which the LORD spake, and came to Bethlehem. And the elders of the town trembled
at his coming, and said, Comest thou peaceably?
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C16V5">&nbsp;</a>And he said, Peaceably: I am come to sacrifice unto the LORD: sanctify yourselves, and come with me to
the sacrifice. And he sanctified Jesse and his sons, and called them to the sacrifice.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C16V6">&nbsp;</a>And it came to pass, when they were come, that he looked on Eliab, and said, Surely the LORD’S anointed
<span class="add">is</span> before him.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C16V7">&nbsp;</a>But the LORD said unto Samuel, Look not on his countenance, or on the height of his stature; because
I have refused him: for
<span class="add">the LORD seeth</span> not as man seeth; for man looketh on the outward appearance, but the LORD looketh on the heart.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C16V8">&nbsp;</a>Then Jesse called Abinadab, and made him pass before Samuel. And he said, Neither hath the LORD chosen
this.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C16V9">&nbsp;</a>Then Jesse made Shammah to pass by. And he said, Neither hath the LORD chosen this.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C16V10">&nbsp;</a>Again, Jesse made seven of his sons to pass before Samuel. And Samuel said unto Jesse, The LORD hath
not chosen these.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C16V11">&nbsp;</a>And Samuel said unto Jesse, Are here all
<span class="add">thy</span> children? And he said, There remaineth yet the youngest, and, behold, he keepeth the sheep. And Samuel
said unto Jesse, Send and fetch him: for we will not sit down till he come hither.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C16V12">&nbsp;</a>And he sent, and brought him in. Now he
<span class="add">was</span> ruddy,
<span class="add">and</span> withal of a beautiful countenance, and goodly to look to. And the LORD said, Arise, anoint him: for
this
<span class="add">is</span> he.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C16V13">&nbsp;</a>Then Samuel took the horn of oil, and anointed him in the midst of his brethren: and the Spirit of the
LORD came upon David from that day forward. So Samuel rose up, and went to Ramah.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C16V14">&nbsp;</a>But the Spirit of the LORD departed from Saul, and an evil spirit from the LORD troubled him.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C16V15">&nbsp;</a>And Saul’s servants said unto him, Behold now, an evil spirit from God troubleth thee.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C16V16">&nbsp;</a>Let our lord now command thy servants,
<span class="add">which are</span> before thee, to seek out a man,
<span class="add">who is</span> a cunning player on an harp: and it shall come to pass, when the evil spirit from God is upon thee,
that he shall play with his hand, and thou shalt be well.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C16V17">&nbsp;</a>And Saul said unto his servants, Provide me now a man that can play well, and bring
<span class="add">him</span> to me.
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C16V18">&nbsp;</a>Then answered one of the servants, and said, Behold, I have seen a son of Jesse the Bethlehemite,
<span class="add">that is</span> cunning in playing, and a mighty valiant man, and a man of war, and prudent in matters, and a comely
person, and the LORD
<span class="add">is</span> with him.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C16V19">&nbsp;</a>Wherefore Saul sent messengers unto Jesse, and said, Send me David thy son, which
<span class="add">is</span> with the sheep.
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C16V20">&nbsp;</a>And Jesse took an ass
<span class="add">laden</span> with bread, and a bottle of wine, and a kid, and sent
<span class="add">them</span> by David his son unto Saul.
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C16V21">&nbsp;</a>And David came to Saul, and stood before him: and he loved him greatly; and he became his armourbearer.
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C16V22">&nbsp;</a>And Saul sent to Jesse, saying, Let David, I pray thee, stand before me; for he hath found favour in
my sight.
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C16V23">&nbsp;</a>And it came to pass, when the
<span class="add">evil</span> spirit from God was upon Saul, that David took an harp, and played with his hand: so Saul was refreshed,
and was well, and the evil spirit departed from him.
