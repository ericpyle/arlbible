 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C6V1">&nbsp;</a>And it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face of the earth, and daughters were born unto
them,
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C6V2">&nbsp;</a>That the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they
<span class="add">were</span> fair; and they took them wives of all which they chose.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C6V3">&nbsp;</a>And the LORD said, My spirit shall not always strive with man, for that he also
<span class="add">is</span> flesh: yet his days shall be an hundred and twenty years.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C6V4">&nbsp;</a>There were giants in the earth in those days; and also after that, when the sons of God came in unto
the daughters of men, and they bare
<span class="add">children</span> to them, the same
<span class="add">became</span> mighty men which
<span class="add">were</span> of old, men of renown.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C6V5">&nbsp;</a>And GOD saw that the wickedness of man
<span class="add">was</span> great in the earth, and
<span class="add">that</span> every imagination of the thoughts of his heart
<span class="add">was</span> only evil continually.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C6V6">&nbsp;</a>And it repented the LORD that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved him at his heart.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C6V7">&nbsp;</a>And the LORD said, I will destroy man whom I have created from the face of the earth; both man, and beast,
and the creeping thing, and the fowls of the air; for it repenteth me that I have made them.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C6V8">&nbsp;</a>But Noah found grace in the eyes of the LORD.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C6V9">&nbsp;</a>These
<span class="add">are</span> the generations of Noah: Noah was a just man
<span class="add">and</span> perfect in his generations,
<span class="add">and</span> Noah walked with God.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C6V10">&nbsp;</a>And Noah begat three sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C6V11">&nbsp;</a>The earth also was corrupt before God, and the earth was filled with violence.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C6V12">&nbsp;</a>And God looked upon the earth, and, behold, it was corrupt; for all flesh had corrupted his way upon
the earth.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C6V13">&nbsp;</a>And God said unto Noah, The end of all flesh is come before me; for the earth is filled with violence
through them; and, behold, I will destroy them with the earth.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C6V14">&nbsp;</a>Make thee an ark of gopher wood; rooms shalt thou make in the ark, and shalt pitch it within and without
with pitch.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C6V15">&nbsp;</a>And this
<span class="add">is the fashion</span> which thou shalt make it
<span class="add">of:</span> The length of the ark
<span class="add">shall be</span> three hundred cubits, the breadth of it fifty cubits, and the height of it thirty cubits.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C6V16">&nbsp;</a>A window shalt thou make to the ark, and in a cubit shalt thou finish it above; and the door of the ark
shalt thou set in the side thereof;
<span class="add">with</span> lower, second, and third
<span class="add">stories</span> shalt thou make it.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C6V17">&nbsp;</a>And, behold, I, even I, do bring a flood of waters upon the earth, to destroy all flesh, wherein
<span class="add">is</span> the breath of life, from under heaven;
<span class="add">and</span> every thing that
<span class="add">is</span> in the earth shall die.
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C6V18">&nbsp;</a>But with thee will I establish my covenant; and thou shalt come into the ark, thou, and thy sons, and
thy wife, and thy sons’ wives with thee.
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C6V19">&nbsp;</a>And of every living thing of all flesh, two of every
<span class="add">sort</span> shalt thou bring into the ark, to keep
<span class="add">them</span> alive with thee; they shall be male and female.
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C6V20">&nbsp;</a>Of fowls after their kind, and of cattle after their kind, of every creeping thing of the earth after
his kind, two of every
<span class="add">sort</span> shall come unto thee, to keep
<span class="add">them</span> alive.
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C6V21">&nbsp;</a>And take thou unto thee of all food that is eaten, and thou shalt gather
<span class="add">it</span> to thee; and it shall be for food for thee, and for them.
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C6V22">&nbsp;</a>Thus did Noah; according to all that God commanded him, so did he.
