 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C4V1">&nbsp;</a>Let us therefore fear, lest, a promise being left
<span class="add">us</span> of entering into his rest, any of you should seem to come short of it.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C4V2">&nbsp;</a>For unto us was the gospel preached, as well as unto them: but the word preached did not profit them,
not being mixed with faith in them that heard
<span class="add">it.
</span> <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C4V3">&nbsp;</a>For we which have believed do enter into rest, as he said, As I have sworn in my wrath, if they shall
enter into my rest: although the works were finished from the foundation of the world.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C4V4">&nbsp;</a>For he spake in a certain place of the seventh
<span class="add">day</span> on this wise, And God did rest the seventh day from all his works.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C4V5">&nbsp;</a>And in this
<span class="add">place</span> again, If they shall enter into my rest.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C4V6">&nbsp;</a>Seeing therefore it remaineth that some must enter therein, and they to whom it was first preached entered
not in because of unbelief:
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C4V7">&nbsp;</a>Again, he limiteth a certain day, saying in David, To day, after so long a time; as it is said, To day
if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C4V8">&nbsp;</a>For if Jesus had given them rest, then would he not afterward have spoken of another day.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C4V9">&nbsp;</a>There remaineth therefore a rest to the people of God.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C4V10">&nbsp;</a>For he that is entered into his rest, he also hath ceased from his own works, as God
<span class="add">did</span> from his.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C4V11">&nbsp;</a>Let us labour therefore to enter into that rest, lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C4V12">&nbsp;</a>For the word of God
<span class="add">is</span> quick, and powerful, and sharper than any twoedged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul
and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and
<span class="add">is</span> a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C4V13">&nbsp;</a>Neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight: but all things
<span class="add">are</span> naked and opened unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C4V14">&nbsp;</a>Seeing then that we have a great high priest, that is passed into the heavens, Jesus the Son of God,
let us hold fast
<span class="add">our</span> profession.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C4V15">&nbsp;</a>For we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but was in
all points tempted like as
<span class="add">we are, yet</span> without sin.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C4V16">&nbsp;</a>Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help
in time of need.
