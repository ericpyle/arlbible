 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C4V1">&nbsp;</a>And the angel that talked with me came again, and waked me, as a man that is wakened out of his sleep,
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C4V2">&nbsp;</a>And said unto me, What seest thou? And I said, I have looked, and behold a candlestick all
<span class="add">of</span> gold, with a bowl upon the top of it, and his seven lamps thereon, and seven pipes to the seven lamps,
which
<span class="add">are
</span> upon the top thereof:
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C4V3">&nbsp;</a>And two olive trees by it, one upon the right
<span class="add">side</span> of the bowl, and the other upon the left
<span class="add">side</span> thereof.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C4V4">&nbsp;</a>So I answered and spake to the angel that talked with me, saying, What
<span class="add">are</span> these, my lord?
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C4V5">&nbsp;</a>Then the angel that talked with me answered and said unto me, Knowest thou not what these be? And I said,
No, my lord.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C4V6">&nbsp;</a>Then he answered and spake unto me, saying, This
<span class="add">is</span> the word of the LORD unto Zerubbabel, saying, Not by might, nor by power, but by my spirit, saith the
LORD of hosts.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C4V7">&nbsp;</a>Who
<span class="add">art</span> thou, O great mountain? before Zerubbabel
<span class="add">thou shalt become</span> a plain: and he shall bring forth the headstone
<span class="add">thereof with</span> shoutings,
<span class="add">crying,</span> Grace, grace unto it.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C4V8">&nbsp;</a>Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C4V9">&nbsp;</a>The hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house; his hands shall also finish it; and thou
shalt know that the LORD of hosts hath sent me unto you.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C4V10">&nbsp;</a>For who hath despised the day of small things? for they shall rejoice, and shall see the plummet in the
hand of Zerubbabel
<span class="add">with</span> those seven; they
<span class="add">are</span> the eyes of the LORD, which run to and fro through the whole earth.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C4V11">&nbsp;</a>Then answered I, and said unto him, What
<span class="add">are</span> these two olive trees upon the right
<span class="add">side</span> of the candlestick and upon the left
<span class="add">side</span> thereof?
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C4V12">&nbsp;</a>And I answered again, and said unto him, What
<span class="add">be these</span> two olive branches which through the two golden pipes empty the golden
<span class="add">oil
</span> out of themselves?
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C4V13">&nbsp;</a>And he answered me and said, Knowest thou not what these
<span class="add">be?
</span> And I said, No, my lord.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C4V14">&nbsp;</a>Then said he, These
<span class="add">are</span> the two anointed ones, that stand by the LORD of the whole earth.
