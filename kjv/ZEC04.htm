And I said, I have looked, and behold a candlestick all <span class='add'>of</span> gold, with a bowl upon the top of it, and his seven lamps thereon, and seven pipes to the seven lamps, which <span class='add'>are</span> upon the top thereof:  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>And two olive trees by it, one upon the right <span class='add'>side</span> of the bowl, and the other upon the left <span class='add'>side</span> thereof.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>So I answered and spake to the angel that talked with me, saying, What <span class='add'>are</span> these, my lord?  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>Then the angel that talked with me answered and said unto me, Knowest thou not what these be? And I said, No, my lord.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>Then he answered and spake unto me, saying, This <span class='add'>is</span> the word of the LORD unto Zerubbabel, saying, Not by might, nor by power, but by my spirit, saith the LORD of hosts.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>Who <span class='add'>art</span> thou, O great mountain? before Zerubbabel <span class='add'>thou shalt become</span> a plain: and he shall bring forth the headstone <span class='add'>thereof with</span> shoutings, <span class='add'>crying</span>, Grace, grace unto it.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>The hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house; his hands shall also finish it; and thou shalt know that the LORD of hosts hath sent me unto you.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>For who hath despised the day of small things? for they shall rejoice, and shall see the plummet in the hand of Zerubbabel <span class='add'>with</span> those seven; they <span class='add'>are</span> the eyes of the LORD, which run to and fro through the whole earth. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>Then answered I, and said unto him, What <span class='add'>are</span> these two olive trees upon the right <span class='add'>side</span> of the candlestick and upon the left <span class='add'>side</span> thereof?  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>And I answered again, and said unto him, What <span class='add'>be these</span> two olive branches which through the two golden pipes empty the golden <span class='add'>oil</span> out of themselves?  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>And he answered me and said, Knowest thou not what these <span class='add'>be?</span> And I said, No, my lord.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>Then said he, These <span class='add'>are</span> the two anointed ones, that stand by the LORD of the whole earth. </div><ul class='tnav'>
