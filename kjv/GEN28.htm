 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C28V1">&nbsp;</a>And Isaac called Jacob, and blessed him, and charged him, and said unto him, Thou shalt not take a wife
of the daughters of Canaan.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C28V2">&nbsp;</a>Arise, go to Padan-aram, to the house of Bethuel thy mother’s father; and take thee a wife from thence
of the daughters of Laban thy mother’s brother.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C28V3">&nbsp;</a>And God Almighty bless thee, and make thee fruitful, and multiply thee, that thou mayest be a multitude
of people;
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C28V4">&nbsp;</a>And give thee the blessing of Abraham, to thee, and to thy seed with thee; that thou mayest inherit the
land wherein thou art a stranger, which God gave unto Abraham.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C28V5">&nbsp;</a>And Isaac sent away Jacob: and he went to Padan-aram unto Laban, son of Bethuel the Syrian, the brother
of Rebekah, Jacob’s and Esau’s mother.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C28V6">&nbsp;</a>When Esau saw that Isaac had blessed Jacob, and sent him away to Padan-aram, to take him a wife from
thence; and that as he blessed him he gave him a charge, saying, Thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters
of Canaan;
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C28V7">&nbsp;</a>And that Jacob obeyed his father and his mother, and was gone to Padan-aram;
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C28V8">&nbsp;</a>And Esau seeing that the daughters of Canaan pleased not Isaac his father;
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C28V9">&nbsp;</a>Then went Esau unto Ishmael, and took unto the wives which he had Mahalath the daughter of Ishmael Abraham’s
son, the sister of Nebajoth, to be his wife.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C28V10">&nbsp;</a>And Jacob went out from Beer-sheba, and went toward Haran.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C28V11">&nbsp;</a>And he lighted upon a certain place, and tarried there all night, because the sun was set; and he took
of the stones of that place, and
<span class="add">put</span> them for his pillows, and lay down in that place to sleep.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C28V12">&nbsp;</a>And he dreamed, and behold a ladder set up on the earth, and the top of it reached to heaven: and behold
the angels of God ascending and descending on it.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C28V13">&nbsp;</a>And, behold, the LORD stood above it, and said, I
<span class="add">am</span> the LORD God of Abraham thy father, and the God of Isaac: the land whereon thou liest, to thee will
I give it, and to thy seed;
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C28V14">&nbsp;</a>And thy seed shall be as the dust of the earth, and thou shalt spread abroad to the west, and to the
east, and to the north, and to the south: and in thee and in thy seed shall all the families of the earth
be blessed.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C28V15">&nbsp;</a>And, behold, I
<span class="add">am</span> with thee, and will keep thee in all
<span class="add">places</span> whither thou goest, and will bring thee again into this land; for I will not leave thee, until I have
done
<span class="add">that</span> which I have spoken to thee of.

<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C28V16">&nbsp;</a>And Jacob awaked out of his sleep, and he said, Surely the LORD is in this place; and I knew
<span class="add">it</span> not.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C28V17">&nbsp;</a>And he was afraid, and said, How dreadful
<span class="add">is</span> this place! this is none other but the house of God, and this
<span class="add">is</span> the gate of heaven.
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C28V18">&nbsp;</a>And Jacob rose up early in the morning, and took the stone that he had put
<span class="add">for</span> his pillows, and set it up
<span class="add">for</span> a pillar, and poured oil upon the top of it.
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C28V19">&nbsp;</a>And he called the name of that place Bethel: but the name of that city
<span class="add">was called</span> Luz at the first.
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C28V20">&nbsp;</a>And Jacob vowed a vow, saying, If God will be with me, and will keep me in this way that I go, and will
give me bread to eat, and raiment to put on,
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C28V21">&nbsp;</a>So that I come again to my father’s house in peace; then shall the LORD be my God:
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C28V22">&nbsp;</a>And this stone, which I have set
<span class="add">for</span> a pillar, shall be God’s house: and of all that thou shalt give me I will surely give the tenth unto
thee.
