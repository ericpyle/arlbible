 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C3V1">&nbsp;</a>Behold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called the sons of God:
therefore the world knoweth us not, because it knew him not.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C3V2">&nbsp;</a>Beloved, now are we the sons of God, and it doth not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that, when
he shall appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C3V3">&nbsp;</a>And every man that hath this hope in him purifieth himself, even as he is pure.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C3V4">&nbsp;</a>Whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law: for sin is the transgression of the law.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C3V5">&nbsp;</a>And ye know that he was manifested to take away our sins; and in him is no sin.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C3V6">&nbsp;</a>Whosoever abideth in him sinneth not: whosoever sinneth hath not seen him, neither known him.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C3V7">&nbsp;</a>Little children, let no man deceive you: he that doeth righteousness is righteous, even as he is righteous.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C3V8">&nbsp;</a>He that committeth sin is of the devil; for the devil sinneth from the beginning. For this purpose the
Son of God was manifested, that he might destroy the works of the devil.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C3V9">&nbsp;</a>Whosoever is born of God doth not commit sin; for his seed remaineth in him: and he cannot sin, because
he is born of God.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C3V10">&nbsp;</a>In this the children of God are manifest, and the children of the devil: whosoever doeth not righteousness
is not of God, neither he that loveth not his brother.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C3V11">&nbsp;</a>For this is the message that ye heard from the beginning, that we should love one another.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C3V12">&nbsp;</a>Not as Cain,
<span class="add">who</span> was of that wicked one, and slew his brother. And wherefore slew he him? Because his own works were
evil, and his brother’s righteous.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C3V13">&nbsp;</a>Marvel not, my brethren, if the world hate you.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C3V14">&nbsp;</a>We know that we have passed from death unto life, because we love the brethren. He that loveth not
<span class="add">his</span> brother abideth in death.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C3V15">&nbsp;</a>Whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer: and ye know that no murderer hath eternal life abiding in
him.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C3V16">&nbsp;</a>Hereby perceive we the love
<span class="add">of God,</span> because he laid down his life for us: and we ought to lay down
<span class="add">our</span> lives for the brethren.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C3V17">&nbsp;</a>But whoso hath this world’s good, and seeth his brother have need, and shutteth up his bowels
<span class="add">of compassion</span> from him, how dwelleth the love of God in him?
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C3V18">&nbsp;</a>My little children, let us not love in word, neither in tongue; but in deed and in truth.
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C3V19">&nbsp;</a>And hereby we know that we are of the truth, and shall assure our hearts before him.
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C3V20">&nbsp;</a>For if our heart condemn us, God is greater than our heart, and knoweth all things.
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C3V21">&nbsp;</a>Beloved, if our heart condemn us not,
<span class="add">then</span> have we confidence toward God.
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C3V22">&nbsp;</a>And whatsoever we ask, we receive of him, because we keep his commandments, and do those things that
are pleasing in his sight.
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C3V23">&nbsp;</a>And this is his commandment, That we should believe on the name of his Son Jesus Christ, and love one
another, as he gave us commandment.
 <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C3V24">&nbsp;</a>And he that keepeth his commandments dwelleth in him, and he in him. And hereby we know that he abideth
in us, by the Spirit which he hath given us.
