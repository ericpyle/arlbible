 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C8V1">&nbsp;</a>In the third year of the reign of king Belshazzar a vision appeared unto me,
<span class="add">even unto</span> me Daniel, after that which appeared unto me at the first.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C8V2">&nbsp;</a>And I saw in a vision; and it came to pass, when I saw, that I
<span class="add">was</span> at Shushan
<span class="add">in</span> the palace, which
<span class="add">is</span> in the province of Elam; and I saw in a vision, and I was by the river of Ulai.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C8V3">&nbsp;</a>Then I lifted up mine eyes, and saw, and, behold, there stood before the river a ram which had
<span class="add">two</span> horns: and the
<span class="add">two</span> horns
<span class="add">were</span> high; but one
<span class="add">was</span> higher than the other, and the higher came up last.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C8V4">&nbsp;</a>I saw the ram pushing westward, and northward, and southward; so that no beasts might stand before him,
neither
<span class="add">was there any</span> that could deliver out of his hand; but he did according to his will, and became great.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C8V5">&nbsp;</a>And as I was considering, behold, an he goat came from the west on the face of the whole earth, and touched
not the ground: and the goat
<span class="add">had</span> a notable horn between his eyes.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C8V6">&nbsp;</a>And he came to the ram that had
<span class="add">two</span> horns, which I had seen standing before the river, and ran unto him in the fury of his power.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C8V7">&nbsp;</a>And I saw him come close unto the ram, and he was moved with choler against him, and smote the ram, and
brake his two horns: and there was no power in the ram to stand before him, but he cast him down to the
ground, and stamped upon him: and there was none that could deliver the ram out of his hand.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C8V8">&nbsp;</a>Therefore the he goat waxed very great: and when he was strong, the great horn was broken; and for it
came up four notable ones toward the four winds of heaven.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C8V9">&nbsp;</a>And out of one of them came forth a little horn, which waxed exceeding great, toward the south, and toward
the east, and toward the pleasant
<span class="add">land.
</span> <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C8V10">&nbsp;</a>And it waxed great,
<span class="add">even</span> to the host of heaven; and it cast down
<span class="add">some</span> of the host and of the stars to the ground, and stamped upon them.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C8V11">&nbsp;</a>Yea, he magnified
<span class="add">himself</span> even to the prince of the host, and by him the daily
<span class="add">sacrifice</span> was taken away, and the place of his sanctuary was cast down.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C8V12">&nbsp;</a>And an host was given
<span class="add">him</span> against the daily
<span class="add">sacrifice</span> by reason of transgression, and it cast down the truth to the ground; and it practised, and prospered.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C8V13">&nbsp;</a>Then I heard one saint speaking, and another saint said unto that certain
<span class="add">saint</span> which spake, How long
<span class="add">shall be</span> the vision
<span class="add">concerning</span> the daily
<span class="add">sacrifice,</span> and the transgression of desolation, to give both the sanctuary and the host to be trodden under foot?
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C8V14">&nbsp;</a>And he said unto me, Unto two thousand and three hundred days; then shall the sanctuary be cleansed.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C8V15">&nbsp;</a>And it came to pass, when I,
<span class="add">even</span> I Daniel, had seen the vision, and sought for the meaning, then, behold, there stood before me as the
appearance of a man.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C8V16">&nbsp;</a>And I heard a man’s voice between
<span class="add">the banks of</span> Ulai, which called, and said, Gabriel, make this
<span class="add">man</span> to understand the vision.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C8V17">&nbsp;</a>So he came near where I stood: and when he came, I was afraid, and fell upon my face: but he said unto
me, Understand, O son of man: for at the time of the end
<span class="add">shall be</span> the vision.
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C8V18">&nbsp;</a>Now as he was speaking with me, I was in a deep sleep on my face toward the ground: but he touched me,
and set me upright.
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C8V19">&nbsp;</a>And he said, Behold, I will make thee know what shall be in the last end of the indignation: for at the
time appointed the end
<span class="add">shall be.
</span> <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C8V20">&nbsp;</a>The ram which thou sawest having
<span class="add">two</span> horns
<span class="add">are</span> the kings of Media and Persia.
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C8V21">&nbsp;</a>And the rough goat
<span class="add">is</span> the king of Grecia: and the great horn that
<span class="add">is</span> between his eyes
<span class="add">is</span> the first king.
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C8V22">&nbsp;</a>Now that being broken, whereas four stood up for it, four kingdoms shall stand up out of the nation,
but not in his power.
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C8V23">&nbsp;</a>And in the latter time of their kingdom, when the transgressors are come to the full, a king of fierce
countenance, and understanding dark sentences, shall stand up.
 <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C8V24">&nbsp;</a>And his power shall be mighty, but not by his own power: and he shall destroy wonderfully, and shall
prosper, and practise, and shall destroy the mighty and the holy people.
 <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C8V25">&nbsp;</a>And through his policy also he shall cause craft to prosper in his hand; and he shall magnify
<span class="add">himself</span> in his heart, and by peace shall destroy many: he shall also stand up against the Prince of princes;
but he shall be broken without hand.
 <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C8V26">&nbsp;</a>And the vision of the evening and the morning which was told
<span class="add">is</span> true: wherefore shut thou up the vision; for it
<span class="add">shall be</span> for many days.
 <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C8V27">&nbsp;</a>And I Daniel fainted, and was sick
<span class="add">certain</span> days; afterward I rose up, and did the king’s business; and I was astonished at the vision, but none
understood
<span class="add">it.</span></div>
