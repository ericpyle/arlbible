sons, and their daughters, every one having knowledge, and having understanding;
 <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C10V29">&nbsp;</a>They clave to their brethren, their nobles, and entered into a curse, and into an oath, to walk in God’s
law, which was given by Moses the servant of God, and to observe and do all the commandments of the LORD
our Lord, and his judgments and his statutes;
 <span class="verse"> 30</span><a name="C10V30">&nbsp;</a>And that we would not give our daughters unto the people of the land, nor take their daughters for our
sons:

<span class="add">if</span> the people of the land bring ware or any victuals on the sabbath day to sell,
<span class="add">that</span> we would not buy it of them on the sabbath, or on the holy day: and
<span class="add">that</span> we would leave the seventh year, and the exaction of every debt.
 <span class="verse"> 32</span><a name="C10V32">&nbsp;</a>Also we made ordinances for us, to charge ourselves yearly with the third part of a shekel for the service
of the house of our God;
 <span class="verse"> 33</span><a name="C10V33">&nbsp;</a>For the shewbread, and for the continual meat offering, and for the continual burnt offering, of the
sabbaths, of the new moons, for the set feasts, and for the holy
<span class="add">things,</span> and for the sin offerings to make an atonement for Israel, and
<span class="add">for</span> all the work of the house of our God.
 <span class="verse"> 34</span><a name="C10V34">&nbsp;</a>And we cast the lots among the priests, the Levites, and the people, for the wood offering, to bring
<span class="add">it</span> into the house of our God, after the houses of our fathers, at times appointed year by year, to burn
upon the altar of the LORD our God, as
<span class="add">it is</span> written in the law:
 <span class="verse"> 35</span><a name="C10V35">&nbsp;</a>And to bring the firstfruits of our ground, and the firstfruits of all fruit of all trees, year by year,
unto the house of the LORD:
 <span class="verse"> 36</span><a name="C10V36">&nbsp;</a>Also the firstborn of our sons, and of our cattle, as
<span class="add">it is
</span> written in the law, and the firstlings of our herds and of our flocks, to bring to the house of our
God, unto the priests that minister in the house of our God:

<span class="add">that</span> we should bring the firstfruits of our dough, and our offerings, and the fruit of all manner of trees,
of wine and of oil, unto the priests, to the chambers of the house of our God; and the tithes of our
ground unto the Levites, that the same Levites might have the tithes in all the cities of our tillage.

house.

will not forsake the house of our God.
