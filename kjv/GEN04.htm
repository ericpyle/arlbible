 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C4V1">&nbsp;</a>And Adam knew Eve his wife; and she conceived, and bare Cain, and said, I have gotten a man from the
LORD.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C4V2">&nbsp;</a>And she again bare his brother Abel. And Abel was a keeper of sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C4V3">&nbsp;</a>And in process of time it came to pass, that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering unto
the LORD.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C4V4">&nbsp;</a>And Abel, he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof. And the LORD had respect
unto Abel and to his offering:
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C4V5">&nbsp;</a>But unto Cain and to his offering he had not respect. And Cain was very wroth, and his countenance fell.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C4V6">&nbsp;</a>And the LORD said unto Cain, Why art thou wroth? and why is thy countenance fallen?
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C4V7">&nbsp;</a>If thou doest well, shalt thou not be accepted? and if thou doest not well, sin lieth at the door. And
unto thee
<span class="add">shall be</span> his desire, and thou shalt rule over him.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C4V8">&nbsp;</a>And Cain talked with Abel his brother: and it came to pass, when they were in the field, that Cain rose
up against Abel his brother, and slew him.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C4V9">&nbsp;</a>And the LORD said unto Cain, Where
<span class="add">is</span> Abel thy brother? And he said, I know not:
<span class="add">Am</span> I my brother’s keeper?
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C4V10">&nbsp;</a>And he said, What hast thou done? the voice of thy brother’s blood crieth unto me from the ground.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C4V11">&nbsp;</a>And now
<span class="add">art</span> thou cursed from the earth, which hath opened her mouth to receive thy brother’s blood from thy hand;
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C4V12">&nbsp;</a>When thou tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield unto thee her strength; a fugitive and a
vagabond shalt thou be in the earth.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C4V13">&nbsp;</a>And Cain said unto the LORD, My punishment
<span class="add">is</span> greater than I can bear.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C4V14">&nbsp;</a>Behold, thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the earth; and from thy face shall I be hid;
and I shall be a fugitive and a vagabond in the earth; and it shall come to pass,
<span class="add">that</span> every one that findeth me shall slay me.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C4V15">&nbsp;</a>And the LORD said unto him, Therefore whosoever slayeth Cain, vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold.
And the LORD set a mark upon Cain, lest any finding him should kill him.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C4V16">&nbsp;</a>And Cain went out from the presence of the LORD, and dwelt in the land of Nod, on the east of Eden.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C4V17">&nbsp;</a>And Cain knew his wife; and she conceived, and bare Enoch: and he builded a city, and called the name
of the city, after the name of his son, Enoch.
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C4V18">&nbsp;</a>And unto Enoch was born Irad: and Irad begat Mehujael: and Mehujael begat Methusael: and Methusael begat
Lamech.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C4V19">&nbsp;</a>And Lamech took unto him two wives: the name of the one
<span class="add">was
</span> Adah, and the name of the other Zillah.
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C4V20">&nbsp;</a>And Adah bare Jabal: he was the father of such as dwell in tents, and
<span class="add">of such as have</span> cattle.
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C4V21">&nbsp;</a>And his brother’s name
<span class="add">was</span> Jubal: he was the father of all such as handle the harp and organ.
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C4V22">&nbsp;</a>And Zillah, she also bare Tubal- cain, an instructer of every artificer in brass and iron: and the sister
of Tubal-cain
<span class="add">was</span> Naamah.
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C4V23">&nbsp;</a>And Lamech said unto his wives, Adah and Zillah, Hear my voice; ye wives of Lamech, hearken unto my speech:
for I have slain a man to my wounding, and a young man to my hurt.
 <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C4V24">&nbsp;</a>If Cain shall be avenged sevenfold, truly Lamech seventy and sevenfold.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C4V25">&nbsp;</a>And Adam knew his wife again; and she bare a son, and called his name Seth: For God,
<span class="add">said she,</span> hath appointed me another seed instead of Abel, whom Cain slew.
 <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C4V26">&nbsp;</a>And to Seth, to him also there was born a son; and he called his name Enos: then began men to call upon
the name of the LORD.
