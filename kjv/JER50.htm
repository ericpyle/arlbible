 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C50V1">&nbsp;</a>The word that the LORD spake against Babylon
<span class="add">and</span> against the land of the Chaldeans by Jeremiah the prophet.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C50V2">&nbsp;</a>Declare ye among the nations, and publish, and set up a standard; publish,
<span class="add">and</span> conceal not: say, Babylon is taken, Bel is confounded, Merodach is broken in pieces; her idols are confounded,
her images are broken in pieces.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C50V3">&nbsp;</a>For out of the north there cometh up a nation against her, which shall make her land desolate, and none
shall dwell therein: they shall remove, they shall depart, both man and beast.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C50V4">&nbsp;</a>In those days, and in that time, saith the LORD, the children of Israel shall come, they and the children
of Judah together, going and weeping: they shall go, and seek the LORD their God.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C50V5">&nbsp;</a>They shall ask the way to Zion with their faces thitherward,
<span class="add">saying,
</span> Come, and let us join ourselves to the LORD in a perpetual covenant
<span class="add">that</span> shall not be forgotten.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C50V6">&nbsp;</a>My people hath been lost sheep: their shepherds have caused them to go astray, they have turned them
away
<span class="add">on</span> the mountains: they have gone from mountain to hill, they have forgotten their restingplace.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C50V7">&nbsp;</a>All that found them have devoured them: and their adversaries said, We offend not, because they have
sinned against the LORD, the habitation of justice, even the LORD, the hope of their fathers.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C50V8">&nbsp;</a>Remove out of the midst of Babylon, and go forth out of the land of the Chaldeans, and be as the he goats
before the flocks.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C50V9">&nbsp;</a>For, lo, I will raise and cause to come up against Babylon an assembly of great nations from the north
country: and they shall set themselves in array against her; from thence she shall be taken: their arrows
<span class="add">shall be
</span> as of a mighty expert man; none shall return in vain.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C50V10">&nbsp;</a>And Chaldea shall be a spoil: all that spoil her shall be satisfied, saith the LORD.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C50V11">&nbsp;</a>Because ye were glad, because ye rejoiced, O ye destroyers of mine heritage, because ye are grown fat
as the heifer at grass, and bellow as bulls;
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C50V12">&nbsp;</a>Your mother shall be sore confounded; she that bare you shall be ashamed: behold, the hindermost of the
nations
<span class="add">shall be</span> a wilderness, a dry land, and a desert.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C50V13">&nbsp;</a>Because of the wrath of the LORD it shall not be inhabited, but it shall be wholly desolate: every one
that goeth by Babylon shall be astonished, and hiss at all her plagues.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C50V14">&nbsp;</a>Put yourselves in array against Babylon round about: all ye that bend the bow, shoot at her, spare no
arrows: for she hath sinned against the LORD.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C50V15">&nbsp;</a>Shout against her round about: she hath given her hand: her foundations are fallen, her walls are thrown
down: for it
<span class="add">is</span> the vengeance of the LORD: take vengeance upon her; as she hath done, do unto her.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C50V16">&nbsp;</a>Cut off the sower from Babylon, and him that handleth the sickle in the time of harvest: for fear of
the oppressing sword they shall turn every one to his people, and they shall flee every one to his own
land.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C50V17">&nbsp;</a>Israel
<span class="add">is</span> a scattered sheep; the lions have driven
<span class="add">him
</span> away: first the king of Assyria hath devoured him; and last this Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon hath
broken his bones.
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C50V18">&nbsp;</a>Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will punish the king of Babylon
and his land, as I have punished the king of Assyria.
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C50V19">&nbsp;</a>And I will bring Israel again to his habitation, and he shall feed on Carmel and Bashan, and his soul
shall be satisfied upon mount Ephraim and Gilead.
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C50V20">&nbsp;</a>In those days, and in that time, saith the LORD, the iniquity of Israel shall be sought for, and
<span class="add">there shall be</span> none; and the sins of Judah, and they shall not be found: for I will pardon them whom I reserve.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C50V21">&nbsp;</a>Go up against the land of Merathaim,
<span class="add">even</span> against it, and against the inhabitants of Pekod: waste and utterly destroy after them, saith the LORD,
and do according to all that I have commanded thee.
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C50V22">&nbsp;</a>A sound of battle
<span class="add">is</span> in the land, and of great destruction.
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C50V23">&nbsp;</a>How is the hammer of the whole earth cut asunder and broken! how is Babylon become a desolation among
the nations!
 <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C50V24">&nbsp;</a>I have laid a snare for thee, and thou art also taken, O Babylon, and thou wast not aware: thou art found,
and also caught, because thou hast striven against the LORD.
 <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C50V25">&nbsp;</a>The LORD hath opened his armoury, and hath brought forth the weapons of his indignation: for this
<span class="add">is</span> the work of the Lord GOD of hosts in the land of the Chaldeans.
 <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C50V26">&nbsp;</a>Come against her from the utmost border, open her storehouses: cast her up as heaps, and destroy her
utterly: let nothing of her be left.
 <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C50V27">&nbsp;</a>Slay all her bullocks; let them go down to the slaughter: woe unto them! for their day is come, the time
of their visitation.
 <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C50V28">&nbsp;</a>The voice of them that flee and escape out of the land of Babylon, to declare in Zion the vengeance of
the LORD our God, the vengeance of his temple.
 <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C50V29">&nbsp;</a>Call together the archers against Babylon: all ye that bend the bow, camp against it round about; let
none thereof escape: recompense her according to her work; according to all that she hath done, do unto
her: for she hath been proud against the LORD, against the Holy One of Israel.
 <span class="verse"> 30</span><a name="C50V30">&nbsp;</a>Therefore shall her young men fall in the streets, and all her men of war shall be cut off in that day,
saith the LORD.
 <span class="verse"> 31</span><a name="C50V31">&nbsp;</a>Behold, I
<span class="add">am</span> against thee,
<span class="add">O thou</span> most proud, saith the Lord GOD of hosts: for thy day is come, the time
<span class="add">that</span> I will visit thee.
 <span class="verse"> 32</span><a name="C50V32">&nbsp;</a>And the most proud shall stumble and fall, and none shall raise him up: and I will kindle a fire in his
cities, and it shall devour all round about him.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 33</span><a name="C50V33">&nbsp;</a>Thus saith the LORD of hosts; The children of Israel and the children of Judah
<span class="add">were</span> oppressed together: and all that took them captives held them fast; they refused to let them go.
 <span class="verse"> 34</span><a name="C50V34">&nbsp;</a>Their Redeemer
<span class="add">is</span> strong; the LORD of hosts
<span class="add">is
</span> his name: he shall throughly plead their cause, that he may give rest to the land, and disquiet the
inhabitants of Babylon.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 35</span><a name="C50V35">&nbsp;</a>A sword
<span class="add">is</span> upon the Chaldeans, saith the LORD, and upon the inhabitants of Babylon, and upon her princes, and upon
her wise
<span class="add">men.
</span> <span class="verse"> 36</span><a name="C50V36">&nbsp;</a>A sword
<span class="add">is</span> upon the liars; and they shall dote: a sword
<span class="add">is</span> upon her mighty men; and they shall be dismayed.
 <span class="verse"> 37</span><a name="C50V37">&nbsp;</a>A sword
<span class="add">is</span> upon their horses, and upon their chariots, and upon all the mingled people that
<span class="add">are</span> in the midst of her; and they shall become as women: a sword
<span class="add">is</span> upon her treasures; and they shall be robbed.
 <span class="verse"> 38</span><a name="C50V38">&nbsp;</a>A drought
<span class="add">is</span> upon her waters; and they shall be dried up: for it
<span class="add">is</span> the land of graven images, and they are mad upon
<span class="add">their
</span> idols.
 <span class="verse"> 39</span><a name="C50V39">&nbsp;</a>Therefore the wild beasts of the desert with the wild beasts of the islands shall dwell
<span class="add">there,</span> and the owls shall dwell therein: and it shall be no more inhabited for ever; neither shall it be dwelt
in from generation to generation.
 <span class="verse"> 40</span><a name="C50V40">&nbsp;</a>As God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah and the neighbour
<span class="add">cities
</span> thereof, saith the LORD;
<span class="add">so</span> shall no man abide there, neither shall any son of man dwell therein.
 <span class="verse"> 41</span><a name="C50V41">&nbsp;</a>Behold, a people shall come from the north, and a great nation, and many kings shall be raised up from
the coasts of the earth.
 <span class="verse"> 42</span><a name="C50V42">&nbsp;</a>They shall hold the bow and the lance: they
<span class="add">are</span> cruel, and will not shew mercy: their voice shall roar like the sea, and they shall ride upon horses,
<span class="add">every one</span> put in array, like a man to the battle, against thee, O daughter of Babylon.
 <span class="verse"> 43</span><a name="C50V43">&nbsp;</a>The king of Babylon hath heard the report of them, and his hands waxed feeble: anguish took hold of him,
<span class="add">and</span> pangs as of a woman in travail.
 <span class="verse"> 44</span><a name="C50V44">&nbsp;</a>Behold, he shall come up like a lion from the swelling of Jordan unto the habitation of the strong: but
I will make them suddenly run away from her: and who
<span class="add">is</span> a chosen
<span class="add">man, that</span> I may appoint over her? for who
<span class="add">is</span> like me? and who will appoint me the time? and who
<span class="add">is</span> that shepherd that will stand before me?
 <span class="verse"> 45</span><a name="C50V45">&nbsp;</a>Therefore hear ye the counsel of the LORD, that he hath taken against Babylon; and his purposes, that
he hath purposed against the land of the Chaldeans: Surely the least of the flock shall draw them out:
surely he shall make
<span class="add">their</span> habitation desolate with them.
 <span class="verse"> 46</span><a name="C50V46">&nbsp;</a>At the noise of the taking of Babylon the earth is moved, and the cry is heard among the nations.
