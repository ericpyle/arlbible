 <span class="verse" id="V1">1&nbsp;</span>The word that the LORD spake against Babylon <span class='add'>and</span> against the land of the Chaldeans by Jeremiah the prophet.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span>Declare ye among the nations, and publish, and set up a standard; publish, <span class='add'>and</span> conceal not: say, Babylon is taken, Bel is confounded, Merodach is broken in pieces; her idols are confounded, her images are broken in pieces.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>For out of the north there cometh up a nation against her, which shall make her land desolate, and none shall dwell therein: they shall remove, they shall depart, both man and beast. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>In those days, and in that time, saith the LORD, the children of Israel shall come, they and the children of Judah together, going and weeping: they shall go, and seek the LORD their God.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>They shall ask the way to Zion with their faces thitherward, <span class='add'>saying</span>, Come, and let us join ourselves to the LORD in a perpetual covenant <span class='add'>that</span> shall not be forgotten.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>My people hath been lost sheep: their shepherds have caused them to go astray, they have turned them away <span class='add'>on</span> the mountains: they have gone from mountain to hill, they have forgotten their restingplace.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>All that found them have devoured them: and their adversaries said, We offend not, because they have sinned against the LORD, the habitation of justice, even the LORD, the hope of their fathers.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>Remove out of the midst of Babylon, and go forth out of the land of the Chaldeans, and be as the he goats before the flocks. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>For, lo, I will raise and cause to come up against Babylon an assembly of great nations from the north country: and they shall set themselves in array against her; from thence she shall be taken: their arrows <span class='add'>shall be</span> as of a mighty expert man; none shall return in vain.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>And Chaldea shall be a spoil: all that spoil her shall be satisfied, saith the LORD.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>Because ye were glad, because ye rejoiced, O ye destroyers of mine heritage, because ye are grown fat as the heifer at grass, and bellow as bulls;  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>Your mother shall be sore confounded; she that bare you shall be ashamed: behold, the hindermost of the nations <span class='add'>shall be</span> a wilderness, a dry land, and a desert.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>Because of the wrath of the LORD it shall not be inhabited, but it shall be wholly desolate: every one that goeth by Babylon shall be astonished, and hiss at all her plagues.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>Put yourselves in array against Babylon round about: all ye that bend the bow, shoot at her, spare no arrows: for she hath sinned against the LORD.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>Shout against her round about: she hath given her hand: her foundations are fallen, her walls are thrown down: for it <span class='add'>is</span> the vengeance of the LORD: take vengeance upon her; as she hath done, do unto her.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>Cut off the sower from Babylon, and him that handleth the sickle in the time of harvest: for fear of the oppressing sword they shall turn every one to his people, and they shall flee every one to his own land. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>Israel <span class='add'>is</span> a scattered sheep; the lions have driven <span class='add'>him</span> away: first the king of Assyria hath devoured him; and last this Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon hath broken his bones.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will punish the king of Babylon and his land, as I have punished the king of Assyria.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>And I will bring Israel again to his habitation, and he shall feed on Carmel and Bashan, and his soul shall be satisfied upon mount Ephraim and Gilead.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>In those days, and in that time, saith the LORD, the iniquity of Israel shall be sought for, and <span class='add'>there shall be</span> none; and the sins of Judah, and they shall not be found: for I will pardon them whom I reserve. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>Go up against the land of Merathaim, <span class='add'>even</span> against it, and against the inhabitants of Pekod: waste and utterly destroy after them, saith the LORD, and do according to all that I have commanded thee.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>A sound of battle <span class='add'>is</span> in the land, and of great destruction.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>How is the hammer of the whole earth cut asunder and broken! how is Babylon become a desolation among the nations!  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>I have laid a snare for thee, and thou art also taken, O Babylon, and thou wast not aware: thou art found, and also caught, because thou hast striven against the LORD.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>The LORD hath opened his armoury, and hath brought forth the weapons of his indignation: for this <span class='add'>is</span> the work of the Lord GOD of hosts in the land of the Chaldeans.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>Come against her from the utmost border, open her storehouses: cast her up as heaps, and destroy her utterly: let nothing of her be left.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>Slay all her bullocks; let them go down to the slaughter: woe unto them! for their day is come, the time of their visitation.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&nbsp;</span>The voice of them that flee and escape out of the land of Babylon, to declare in Zion the vengeance of the LORD our God, the vengeance of his temple.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&nbsp;</span>Call together the archers against Babylon: all ye that bend the bow, camp against it round about; let none thereof escape: recompense her according to her work; according to all that she hath done, do unto her: for she hath been proud against the LORD, against the Holy One of Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&nbsp;</span>Therefore shall her young men fall in the streets, and all her men of war shall be cut off in that day, saith the LORD.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&nbsp;</span>Behold, I <span class='add'>am</span> against thee, <span class='add'>O thou</span> most proud, saith the Lord GOD of hosts: for thy day is come, the time <span class='add'>that</span> I will visit thee.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&nbsp;</span>And the most proud shall stumble and fall, and none shall raise him up: and I will kindle a fire in his cities, and it shall devour all round about him. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V33">33&nbsp;</span>Thus saith the LORD of hosts; The children of Israel and the children of Judah <span class='add'>were</span> oppressed together: and all that took them captives held them fast; they refused to let them go.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&nbsp;</span>Their Redeemer <span class='add'>is</span> strong; the LORD of hosts <span class='add'>is</span> his name: he shall throughly plead their cause, that he may give rest to the land, and disquiet the inhabitants of Babylon. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V35">35&nbsp;</span>A sword <span class='add'>is</span> upon the Chaldeans, saith the LORD, and upon the inhabitants of Babylon, and upon her princes, and upon her wise <span class='add'>men</span>.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&nbsp;</span>A sword <span class='add'>is</span> upon the liars; and they shall dote: a sword <span class='add'>is</span> upon her mighty men; and they shall be dismayed.  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&nbsp;</span>A sword <span class='add'>is</span> upon their horses, and upon their chariots, and upon all the mingled people that <span class='add'>are</span> in the midst of her; and they shall become as women: a sword <span class='add'>is</span> upon her treasures; and they shall be robbed.  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&nbsp;</span>A drought <span class='add'>is</span> upon her waters; and they shall be dried up: for it <span class='add'>is</span> the land of graven images, and they are mad upon <span class='add'>their</span> idols.  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&nbsp;</span>Therefore the wild beasts of the desert with the wild beasts of the islands shall dwell <span class='add'>there</span>, and the owls shall dwell therein: and it shall be no more inhabited for ever; neither shall it be dwelt in from generation to generation.  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&nbsp;</span>As God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah and the neighbour <span class='add'>cities</span> thereof, saith the LORD; <span class='add'>so</span> shall no man abide there, neither shall any son of man dwell therein.  <span class="verse" id="V41">41&nbsp;</span>Behold, a people shall come from the north, and a great nation, and many kings shall be raised up from the coasts of the earth.  <span class="verse" id="V42">42&nbsp;</span>They shall hold the bow and the lance: they <span class='add'>are</span> cruel, and will not shew mercy: their voice shall roar like the sea, and they shall ride upon horses, <span class='add'>every one</span> put in array, like a man to the battle, against thee, O daughter of Babylon.  <span class="verse" id="V43">43&nbsp;</span>The king of Babylon hath heard the report of them, and his hands waxed feeble: anguish took hold of him, <span class='add'>and</span> pangs as of a woman in travail.  <span class="verse" id="V44">44&nbsp;</span>Behold, he shall come up like a lion from the swelling of Jordan unto the habitation of the strong: but I will make them suddenly run away from her: and who <span class='add'>is</span> a chosen <span class='add'>man, that</span> I may appoint over her? for who <span class='add'>is</span> like me? and who will appoint me the time? and who <span class='add'>is</span> that shepherd that will stand before me?  <span class="verse" id="V45">45&nbsp;</span>Therefore hear ye the counsel of the LORD, that he hath taken against Babylon; and his purposes, that he hath purposed against the land of the Chaldeans: Surely the least of the flock shall draw them out: surely he shall make <span class='add'>their</span> habitation desolate with them.  <span class="verse" id="V46">46&nbsp;</span>At the noise of the taking of Babylon the earth is moved, and the cry is heard among the nations. </div><ul class='tnav'>
