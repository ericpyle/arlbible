 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C10V1">&nbsp;</a>A wise judge will instruct his people; and the government of a prudent man is well ordered.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C10V2">&nbsp;</a>As the judge of the people is himself, so are his officers; and what manner of man the ruler of the city
is, such are all they that dwell therein.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C10V3">&nbsp;</a>An unwise king destroyeth his people; but through the prudence of them which are in authority the city
shall be inhabited.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C10V4">&nbsp;</a>The power of the earth is in the hand of the Lord, and in due time he will set over it one that is profitable.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C10V5">&nbsp;</a>In the hand of God is the prosperity of man: and upon the person of the scribe shall he lay his honour.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C10V6">&nbsp;</a>Bear not hatred to thy neighbour for every wrong; and do nothing at all by injurious practices.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C10V7">&nbsp;</a>Pride is hateful before God and man: and by both doth one commit iniquity.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C10V8">&nbsp;</a>Because of unrighteous dealings, injuries, and riches got by deceit, the kingdom is translated from one
people to another.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C10V9">&nbsp;</a>Why is earth and ashes proud? There is not a more wicked thing than a covetous man: for such an one setteth
his own soul to sale; because while he liveth he casteth away his bowels.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C10V10">&nbsp;</a>The physician cutteth off a long disease; and he that is to day a king to morrow shall die.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C10V11">&nbsp;</a>For when a man is dead, he shall inherit creeping things, beasts, and worms.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C10V12">&nbsp;</a>The beginning of pride is when one departeth from God, and his heart is turned away from his Maker.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C10V13">&nbsp;</a>For pride is the beginning of sin, and he that hath it shall pour out abomination: and therefore the
Lord brought upon them strange calamities, and overthrew them utterly.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C10V14">&nbsp;</a>The Lord hath cast down the thrones of proud princes, and set up the meek in their stead.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C10V15">&nbsp;</a>The Lord hath plucked up the roots of the proud nations, and planted the lowly in their place.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C10V16">&nbsp;</a>The Lord overthrew countries of the heathen, and destroyed them to the foundations of the earth.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C10V17">&nbsp;</a>He took some of them away, and destroyed them, and hath made their memorial to cease from the earth.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C10V18">&nbsp;</a>Pride was not made for men, nor furious anger for them that are born of a woman.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C10V19">&nbsp;</a>They that fear the Lord are a sure seed, and they that love him an honourable plant: they that regard
not the law are a dishonourable seed; they that transgress the commandments are a deceivable seed.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C10V20">&nbsp;</a>Among brethren he that is chief is honorable; so are they that fear the Lord in his eyes.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C10V21">&nbsp;</a>The fear of the Lord goeth before the obtaining of authority: but roughness and pride is the losing thereof.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C10V22">&nbsp;</a>Whether he be rich, noble, or poor, their glory is the fear of the Lord.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C10V23">&nbsp;</a>It is not meet to despise the poor man that hath understanding; neither is it convenient to magnify a
sinful man.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C10V24">&nbsp;</a>Great men, and judges, and potentates, shall be honoured; yet is there none of them greater than he that
feareth the Lord.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C10V25">&nbsp;</a>Unto the servant that is wise shall they that are free do service: and he that hath knowledge will not
grudge when he is reformed.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C10V26">&nbsp;</a>Be not overwise in doing thy business; and boast not thyself in the time of thy distress.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C10V27">&nbsp;</a>Better is he that laboureth, and aboundeth in all things, than he that boasteth himself, and wanteth
bread.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C10V28">&nbsp;</a>My son, glorify thy soul in meekness, and give it honour according to the dignity thereof.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C10V29">&nbsp;</a>Who will justify him that sinneth against his own soul? and who will honour him that dishonoureth his
own life?
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 30</span><a name="C10V30">&nbsp;</a>The poor man is honoured for his skill, and the rich man is honoured for his riches.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 31</span><a name="C10V31">&nbsp;</a>He that is honoured in poverty, how much more in riches? and he that is dishonourable in riches, how
much more in poverty?
