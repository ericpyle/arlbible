<div class="chapterlabel"> 5</div><div class="p">
 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C5V1">&nbsp;</a>Then shall the righteous man stand in great boldness before the face of such as have afflicted him, and
made no account of his labours.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C5V2">&nbsp;</a>When they see it, they shall be troubled with terrible fear, and shall be amazed at the strangeness of
his salvation, so far beyond all that they looked for.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C5V3">&nbsp;</a>And they repenting and groaning for anguish of spirit shall say within themselves, This was he, whom
we had sometimes in derision, and a proverb of reproach:
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C5V4">&nbsp;</a>We fools accounted his life madness, and his end to be without honour:
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C5V5">&nbsp;</a>How is he numbered among the children of God, and his lot is among the saints!
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C5V6">&nbsp;</a>Therefore have we erred from the way of truth, and the light of righteousness hath not shined unto us,
and the sun of righteousness rose not upon us.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C5V7">&nbsp;</a>We wearied ourselves in the way of wickedness and destruction: yea, we have gone through deserts, where
there lay no way: but as for the way of the Lord, we have not known it.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C5V8">&nbsp;</a>What hath pride profited us? or what good hath riches with our vaunting brought us?
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C5V9">&nbsp;</a>All those things are passed away like a shadow, and as a post that hasted by;
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C5V10">&nbsp;</a>And as a ship that passeth over the waves of the water, which when it is gone by, the trace thereof cannot
be found, neither the pathway of the keel in the waves;
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C5V11">&nbsp;</a>Or as when a bird hath flown through the air, there is no token of her way to be found, but the light
air being beaten with the stroke of her wings and parted with the violent noise and motion of them, is
passed through, and therein afterwards no sign where she went is to be found;
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C5V12">&nbsp;</a>Or like as when an arrow is shot at a mark, it parteth the air, which immediately cometh together again,
so that a man cannot know where it went through:
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C5V13">&nbsp;</a>Even so we in like manner, as soon as we were born, began to draw to our end, and had no sign of virtue
to shew; but were consumed in our own wickedness.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C5V14">&nbsp;</a>For the hope of the Godly is like dust that is blown away with the wind; like a thin froth that is driven
away with the storm; like as the smoke which is dispersed here and there with a tempest, and passeth
away as the remembrance of a guest that tarrieth but a day.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C5V15">&nbsp;</a>But the righteous live for evermore; their reward also is with the Lord, and the care of them is with
the most High.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C5V16">&nbsp;</a>Therefore shall they receive a glorious kingdom, and a beautiful crown from the Lord’s hand: for with
his right hand shall he cover them, and with his arm shall he protect them.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C5V17">&nbsp;</a>He shall take to him his jealousy for complete armour, and make the creature his weapon for the revenge
of his enemies.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C5V18">&nbsp;</a>He shall put on righteousness as a breastplate, and true judgment instead of an helmet.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C5V19">&nbsp;</a>He shall take holiness for an invincible shield.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C5V20">&nbsp;</a>His severe wrath shall he sharpen for a sword, and the world shall fight with him against the unwise.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C5V21">&nbsp;</a>Then shall the right aiming thunderbolts go abroad; and from the clouds, as from a well drawn bow, shall
they fly to the mark.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C5V22">&nbsp;</a>And hailstones full of wrath shall be cast as out of a stone bow, and the water of the sea shall rage
against them, and the floods shall cruelly drown them.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C5V23">&nbsp;</a>Yea, a mighty wind shall stand up against them, and like a storm shall blow them away: thus iniquity
shall lay waste the whole earth, and ill dealing shall overthrow the thrones of the mighty.
