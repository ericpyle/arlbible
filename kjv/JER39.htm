<div class="chapterlabel"> 39</div><div class="p">
 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C39V1">&nbsp;</a>In the ninth year of Zedekiah king of Judah, in the tenth month, came Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon
and all his army against Jerusalem, and they besieged it.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C39V2">&nbsp;</a><span class="add">And</span> in the eleventh year of Zedekiah, in the fourth month, the ninth
<span class="add">day</span> of the month, the city was broken up.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C39V3">&nbsp;</a>And all the princes of the king of Babylon came in, and sat in the middle gate,
<span class="add">even</span> Nergal-sharezer, Samgar-nebo, Sarsechim, Rab-saris, Nergal-sharezer, Rabmag, with all the residue of
the princes of the king of Babylon.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C39V4">&nbsp;</a>And it came to pass,
<span class="add">that</span> when Zedekiah the king of Judah saw them, and all the men of war, then they fled, and went forth out
of the city by night, by the way of the king’s garden, by the gate betwixt the two walls: and he went
out the way of the plain.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C39V5">&nbsp;</a>But the Chaldeans’ army pursued after them, and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho: and when
they had taken him, they brought him up to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon to Riblah in the land of Hamath,
where he gave judgment upon him.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C39V6">&nbsp;</a>Then the king of Babylon slew the sons of Zedekiah in Riblah before his eyes: also the king of Babylon
slew all the nobles of Judah.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C39V7">&nbsp;</a>Moreover he put out Zedekiah’s eyes, and bound him with chains, to carry him to Babylon.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C39V8">&nbsp;</a>And the Chaldeans burned the king’s house, and the houses of the people, with fire, and brake down the
walls of Jerusalem.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C39V9">&nbsp;</a>Then Nebuzar-adan the captain of the guard carried away captive into Babylon the remnant of the people
that remained in the city, and those that fell away, that fell to him, with the rest of the people that
remained.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C39V10">&nbsp;</a>But Nebuzar-adan the captain of the guard left of the poor of the people, which had nothing, in the land
of Judah, and gave them vineyards and fields at the same time.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C39V11">&nbsp;</a>Now Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon gave charge concerning Jeremiah to Nebuzar-adan the captain of the
guard, saying,
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C39V12">&nbsp;</a>Take him, and look well to him, and do him no harm; but do unto him even as he shall say unto thee.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C39V13">&nbsp;</a>So Nebuzar-adan the captain of the guard sent, and Nebushasban, Rab-saris, and Nergal-sharezer, Rabmag,
and all the king of Babylon’s princes;
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C39V14">&nbsp;</a>Even they sent, and took Jeremiah out of the court of the prison, and committed him unto Gedaliah the
son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan, that he should carry him home: so he dwelt among the people.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C39V15">&nbsp;</a>Now the word of the LORD came unto Jeremiah, while he was shut up in the court of the prison, saying,
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C39V16">&nbsp;</a>Go and speak to Ebed-melech the Ethiopian, saying, Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold,
I will bring my words upon this city for evil, and not for good; and they shall be
<span class="add">accomplished</span> in that day before thee.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C39V17">&nbsp;</a>But I will deliver thee in that day, saith the LORD: and thou shalt not be given into the hand of the
men of whom thou
<span class="add">art</span> afraid.
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C39V18">&nbsp;</a>For I will surely deliver thee, and thou shalt not fall by the sword, but thy life shall be for a prey
unto thee: because thou hast put thy trust in me, saith the LORD.
