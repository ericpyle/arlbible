 <span class="verse" id="V1">1&nbsp;</span>And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span>On the first day of the first month shalt thou set up the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>And thou shalt put therein the ark of the testimony, and cover the ark with the vail.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>And thou shalt bring in the table, and set in order the things that are to be set in order upon it; and thou shalt bring in the candlestick, and light the lamps thereof.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>And thou shalt set the altar of gold for the incense before the ark of the testimony, and put the hanging of the door to the tabernacle.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>And thou shalt set the altar of the burnt offering before the door of the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>And thou shalt set the laver between the tent of the congregation and the altar, and shalt put water therein.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>And thou shalt set up the court round about, and hang up the hanging at the court gate.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>And thou shalt take the anointing oil, and anoint the tabernacle, and all that <span class='add'>is</span> therein, and shalt hallow it, and all the vessels thereof: and it shall be holy.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>And thou shalt anoint the altar of the burnt offering, and all his vessels, and sanctify the altar: and it shall be an altar most holy.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>And thou shalt anoint the laver and his foot, and sanctify it.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>And thou shalt bring Aaron and his sons unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and wash them with water.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>And thou shalt put upon Aaron the holy garments, and anoint him, and sanctify him; that he may minister unto me in the priest’s office.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>And thou shalt bring his sons, and clothe them with coats:  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>And thou shalt anoint them, as thou didst anoint their father, that they may minister unto me in the priest’s office: for their anointing shall surely be an everlasting priesthood throughout their generations.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>Thus did Moses: according to all that the LORD commanded him, so did he. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>And it came to pass in the first month in the second year, on the first <span class='add'>day</span> of the month, <span class='add'>that</span> the tabernacle was reared up.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>And Moses reared up the tabernacle, and fastened his sockets, and set up the boards thereof, and put in the bars thereof, and reared up his pillars.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>And he spread abroad the tent over the tabernacle, and put the covering of the tent above upon it; as the LORD commanded Moses. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>And he took and put the testimony into the ark, and set the staves on the ark, and put the mercy seat above upon the ark:  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>And he brought the ark into the tabernacle, and set up the vail of the covering, and covered the ark of the testimony; as the LORD commanded Moses. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>And he put the table in the tent of the congregation, upon the side of the tabernacle northward, without the vail.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>And he set the bread in order upon it before the LORD; as the LORD had commanded Moses. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>And he put the candlestick in the tent of the congregation, over against the table, on the side of the tabernacle southward.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>And he lighted the lamps before the LORD; as the LORD commanded Moses. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>And he put the golden altar in the tent of the congregation before the vail:  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>And he burnt sweet incense thereon; as the LORD commanded Moses. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V28">28&nbsp;</span>And he set up the hanging <span class='add'>at</span> the door of the tabernacle.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&nbsp;</span>And he put the altar of burnt offering <span class='add'>by</span> the door of the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation, and offered upon it the burnt offering and the meat offering; as the LORD commanded Moses. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V30">30&nbsp;</span>And he set the laver between the tent of the congregation and the altar, and put water there, to wash <span class='add'>withal</span>.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&nbsp;</span>And Moses and Aaron and his sons washed their hands and their feet thereat:  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&nbsp;</span>When they went into the tent of the congregation, and when they came near unto the altar, they washed; as the LORD commanded Moses.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&nbsp;</span>And he reared up the court round about the tabernacle and the altar, and set up the hanging of the court gate. So Moses finished the work. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V34">34&nbsp;</span>Then a cloud covered the tent of the congregation, and the glory of the LORD filled the tabernacle.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&nbsp;</span>And Moses was not able to enter into the tent of the congregation, because the cloud abode thereon, and the glory of the LORD filled the tabernacle.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&nbsp;</span>And when the cloud was taken up from over the tabernacle, the children of Israel went onward in all their journeys:  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&nbsp;</span>But if the cloud were not taken up, then they journeyed not till the day that it was taken up.  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&nbsp;</span>For the cloud of the LORD <span class='add'>was</span> upon the tabernacle by day, and fire was on it by night, in the sight of all the house of Israel, throughout all their journeys. </div><ul class='tnav'>
