<div class="chapterlabel"> 11</div><div class="p">
 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C11V1">&nbsp;</a>Then saw I a dream, and, behold, there came up from the sea an eagle, which had twelve feathered wings,
and three heads.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C11V2">&nbsp;</a>And I saw, and, behold, she spread her wings over all the earth, and all the winds of the air blew on
her, and were gathered together.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C11V3">&nbsp;</a>And I beheld, and out of her feathers there grew other contrary feathers; and they became little feathers
and small.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C11V4">&nbsp;</a>But her heads were at rest: the head in the midst was greater than the other, yet rested it with the
residue.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C11V5">&nbsp;</a>Moreover I beheld, and, lo, the eagle flew with her feathers, and reigned upon earth, and over them that
dwelt therein.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C11V6">&nbsp;</a>And I saw that all things under heaven were subject unto her, and no man spake against her, no, not one
creature upon earth.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C11V7">&nbsp;</a>And I beheld, and, lo, the eagle rose upon her talons, and spake to her feathers, saying,
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C11V8">&nbsp;</a>Watch not all at once: sleep every one in his own place, and watch by course:
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C11V9">&nbsp;</a>But let the heads be preserved for the last.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C11V10">&nbsp;</a>And I beheld, and, lo, the voice went not out of her heads, but from the midst of her body.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C11V11">&nbsp;</a>And I numbered her contrary feathers, and, behold, there were eight of them.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C11V12">&nbsp;</a>And I looked, and, behold, on the right side there arose one feather, and reigned over all the earth;
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C11V13">&nbsp;</a>And so it was, that when it reigned, the end of it came, and the place thereof appeared no more: so the
next following stood up. and reigned, and had a great time;
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C11V14">&nbsp;</a>And it happened, that when it reigned, the end of it came also, like as the first, so that it appeared
no more.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C11V15">&nbsp;</a>Then came there a voice unto it, and said,
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C11V16">&nbsp;</a>Hear thou that hast borne rule over the earth so long: this I say unto thee, before thou beginnest to
appear no more,
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C11V17">&nbsp;</a>There shall none after thee attain unto thy time, neither unto the half thereof.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C11V18">&nbsp;</a>Then arose the third, and reigned as the other before, and appeared no more also.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C11V19">&nbsp;</a>So went it with all the residue one after another, as that every one reigned, and then appeared no more.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C11V20">&nbsp;</a>Then I beheld, and, lo, in process of time the feathers that followed stood up upon the right side, that
they might rule also; and some of them ruled, but within a while they appeared no more:
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C11V21">&nbsp;</a>For some of them were set up, but ruled not.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C11V22">&nbsp;</a>After this I looked, and, behold, the twelve feathers appeared no more, nor the two little feathers:
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C11V23">&nbsp;</a>And there was no more upon the eagle’s body, but three heads that rested, and six little wings.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C11V24">&nbsp;</a>Then saw I also that two little feathers divided themselves from the six, and remained under the head
that was upon the right side: for the four continued in their place.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C11V25">&nbsp;</a>And I beheld, and, lo, the feathers that were under the wing thought to set up themselves and to have
the rule.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C11V26">&nbsp;</a>And I beheld, and, lo, there was one set up, but shortly it appeared no more.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C11V27">&nbsp;</a>And the second was sooner away than the first.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C11V28">&nbsp;</a>And I beheld, and, lo, the two that remained thought also in themselves to reign:
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C11V29">&nbsp;</a>And when they so thought, behold, there awaked one of the heads that were at rest, namely, it that was
in the midst; for that was greater than the two other heads.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 30</span><a name="C11V30">&nbsp;</a>And then I saw that the two other heads were joined with it.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 31</span><a name="C11V31">&nbsp;</a>And, behold, the head was turned with them that were with it, and did eat up the two feathers under the
wing that would have reigned.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 32</span><a name="C11V32">&nbsp;</a>But this head put the whole earth in fear, and bare rule in it over all those that dwelt upon the earth
with much oppression; and it had the governance of the world more than all the wings that had been.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 33</span><a name="C11V33">&nbsp;</a>And after this I beheld, and, lo, the head that was in the midst suddenly appeared no more, like as the
wings.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 34</span><a name="C11V34">&nbsp;</a>But there remained the two heads, which also in like sort ruled upon the earth, and over those that dwelt
therein.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 35</span><a name="C11V35">&nbsp;</a>And I beheld, and, lo, the head upon the right side devoured it that was upon the left side.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 36</span><a name="C11V36">&nbsp;</a>Then I head a voice, which said unto me, Look before thee, and consider the thing that thou seest.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 37</span><a name="C11V37">&nbsp;</a>And I beheld, and lo, as it were a roaring lion chased out of the wood: and I saw that he sent out a
man’s voice unto the eagle, and said,
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 38</span><a name="C11V38">&nbsp;</a>Hear thou, I will talk with thee, and the Highest shall say unto thee,
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 39</span><a name="C11V39">&nbsp;</a>Art not thou it that remainest of the four beasts, whom I made to reign in my world, that the end of
their times might come through them?
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 40</span><a name="C11V40">&nbsp;</a>And the fourth came, and overcame all the beasts that were past, and had power over the world with great
fearfulness, and over the whole compass of the earth with much wicked oppression; and so long time dwelt
he upon the earth with deceit.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 41</span><a name="C11V41">&nbsp;</a>For the earth hast thou not judged with truth.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 42</span><a name="C11V42">&nbsp;</a>For thou hast afflicted the meek, thou hast hurt the peaceable, thou hast loved liars, and destroyed
the dwellings of them that brought forth fruit, and hast cast down the walls of such as did thee no harm.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 43</span><a name="C11V43">&nbsp;</a>Therefore is thy wrongful dealing come up unto the Highest, and thy pride unto the Mighty.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 44</span><a name="C11V44">&nbsp;</a>The Highest also hath looked upon the proud times, and, behold, they are ended, and his abominations
are fulfilled.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 45</span><a name="C11V45">&nbsp;</a>And therefore appear no more, thou eagle, nor thy horrible wings, nor thy wicked feathers nor thy malicious
heads, nor thy hurtful claws, nor all thy vain body:
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 46</span><a name="C11V46">&nbsp;</a>That all the earth may be refreshed, and may return, being delivered from thy violence, and that she
may hope for the judgment and mercy of him that made her.
