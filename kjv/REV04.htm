 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C4V1">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">After this I looked, and, behold, a door
</span><span class="add">was</span><span class="wj"> opened in heaven: and the first voice which I heard
</span><span class="add">was</span><span class="wj"> as it were of a trumpet talking with me; which said, Come up hither, and I will shew thee things which
must be hereafter.
</span> <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C4V2">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And immediately I was in the spirit: and, behold, a throne was set in heaven, and
</span><span class="add">one</span><span class="wj"> sat on the throne.
</span> <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C4V3">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And he that sat was to look upon like a jasper and a sardine stone: and
</span><span class="add">there was</span><span class="wj"> a rainbow round about the throne, in sight like unto an emerald.
</span> <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C4V4">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And round about the throne
</span><span class="add">were</span><span class="wj"> four and twenty seats: and upon the seats I saw four and twenty elders sitting, clothed in white raiment;
and they had on their heads crowns of gold.
</span> <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C4V5">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And out of the throne proceeded lightnings and thunderings and voices: and
</span><span class="add">there were</span><span class="wj"> seven lamps of fire burning before the throne, which are the seven Spirits of God.
</span> <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C4V6">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And before the throne
</span><span class="add">there was</span><span class="wj"> a sea of glass like unto crystal: and in the midst of the throne, and round about the throne,
</span><span class="add">were</span><span class="wj"> four beasts full of eyes before and behind.
</span> <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C4V7">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And the first beast
</span><span class="add">was</span><span class="wj"> like a lion, and the second beast like a calf, and the third beast had a face as a man, and the fourth
beast
</span><span class="add">was</span><span class="wj"> like a flying eagle.
</span> <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C4V8">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And the four beasts had each of them six wings about
</span><span class="add">him;
</span><span class="wj"> and
</span><span class="add">they were</span><span class="wj"> full of eyes within: and they rest not day and night, saying, Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty, which
was, and is, and is to come.
</span> <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C4V9">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And when those beasts give glory and honour and thanks to him that sat on the throne, who liveth for
ever and ever,
</span> <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C4V10">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">The four and twenty elders fall down before him that sat on the throne, and worship him that liveth for
ever and ever, and cast their crowns before the throne, saying,
</span> <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C4V11">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Thou art worthy, O Lord, to receive glory and honour and power: for thou hast created all things, and
for thy pleasure they are and were created.
