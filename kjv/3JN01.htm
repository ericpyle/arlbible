<div class="mt1">The Third Epistle of John
</div>
<div class="chapterlabel"> 1</div><div class="p">
 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C1V1">&nbsp;</a>The elder unto the wellbeloved Gaius, whom I love in the truth.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C1V2">&nbsp;</a>Beloved, I wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and be in health, even as thy soul prospereth.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C1V3">&nbsp;</a>For I rejoiced greatly, when the brethren came and testified of the truth that is in thee, even as thou
walkest in the truth.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C1V4">&nbsp;</a>I have no greater joy than to hear that my children walk in truth.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C1V5">&nbsp;</a>Beloved, thou doest faithfully whatsoever thou doest to the brethren, and to strangers;
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C1V6">&nbsp;</a>Which have borne witness of thy charity before the church: whom if thou bring forward on their journey
after a godly sort, thou shalt do well:
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C1V7">&nbsp;</a>Because that for his name’s sake they went forth, taking nothing of the Gentiles.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C1V8">&nbsp;</a>We therefore ought to receive such, that we might be fellowhelpers to the truth.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C1V9">&nbsp;</a>I wrote unto the church: but Diotrephes, who loveth to have the preeminence among them, receiveth us
not.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C1V10">&nbsp;</a>Wherefore, if I come, I will remember his deeds which he doeth, prating against us with malicious words:
and not content therewith, neither doth he himself receive the brethren, and forbiddeth them that would,
and casteth
<span class="add">them</span> out of the church.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C1V11">&nbsp;</a>Beloved, follow not that which is evil, but that which is good. He that doeth good is of God: but he
that doeth evil hath not seen God.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C1V12">&nbsp;</a>Demetrius hath good report of all
<span class="add">men,</span> and of the truth itself: yea, and we
<span class="add">also</span> bear record; and ye know that our record is true.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C1V13">&nbsp;</a>I had many things to write, but I will not with ink and pen write unto thee:
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C1V14">&nbsp;</a>But I trust I shall shortly see thee, and we shall speak face to face. Peace
<span class="add">be</span> to thee.
<span class="add">Our</span> friends salute thee. Greet the friends by name.
