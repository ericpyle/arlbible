 <span class="verse" id="V1">1&nbsp;</span>Against Moab thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Woe unto Nebo! for it is spoiled: Kiriathaim is confounded <span class='add'>and</span> taken: Misgab is confounded and dismayed.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span> <span class='add'>There shall be</span> no more praise of Moab: in Heshbon they have devised evil against it; come, and let us cut it off from <span class='add'>being</span> a nation. Also thou shalt be cut down, O Madmen; the sword shall pursue thee.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>A voice of crying <span class='add'>shall be</span> from Horonaim, spoiling and great destruction.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>Moab is destroyed; her little ones have caused a cry to be heard.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>For in the going up of Luhith continual weeping shall go up; for in the going down of Horonaim the enemies have heard a cry of destruction.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>Flee, save your lives, and be like the heath in the wilderness. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>For because thou hast trusted in thy works and in thy treasures, thou shalt also be taken: and Chemosh shall go forth into captivity <span class='add'>with</span> his priests and his princes together.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>And the spoiler shall come upon every city, and no city shall escape: the valley also shall perish, and the plain shall be destroyed, as the LORD hath spoken.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>Give wings unto Moab, that it may flee and get away: for the cities thereof shall be desolate, without any to dwell therein.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>Cursed <span class='add'>be</span> he that doeth the work of the LORD deceitfully, and cursed <span class='add'>be</span> he that keepeth back his sword from blood. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>Moab hath been at ease from his youth, and he hath settled on his lees, and hath not been emptied from vessel to vessel, neither hath he gone into captivity: therefore his taste remained in him, and his scent is not changed.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will send unto him wanderers, that shall cause him to wander, and shall empty his vessels, and break their bottles.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>And Moab shall be ashamed of Chemosh, as the house of Israel was ashamed of Beth-el their confidence. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>How say ye, We <span class='add'>are</span> mighty and strong men for the war?

was he found among thieves? for since thou spakest of him, thou skippedst for joy.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&nbsp;</span>O ye that dwell in Moab, leave the cities, and dwell in the rock, and be like the dove <span class='add'>that</span> maketh her nest in the sides of the hole’s mouth.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&nbsp;</span>We have heard the pride of Moab, (he is exceeding proud) his loftiness, and his arrogancy, and his pride, and the haughtiness of his heart.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&nbsp;</span>I know his wrath, saith the LORD; but <span class='add'>it shall</span> not <span class='add'>be</span> so; his lies shall not so effect <span class='add'>it</span>.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&nbsp;</span>Therefore will I howl for Moab, and I will cry out for all Moab; <span class='add'>mine heart</span> shall mourn for the men of Kir-heres.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&nbsp;</span>O vine of Sibmah, I will weep for thee with the weeping of Jazer: thy plants are gone over the sea, they reach <span class='add'>even</span> to the sea of Jazer: the spoiler is fallen upon thy summer fruits and upon thy vintage.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&nbsp;</span>And joy and gladness is taken from the plentiful field, and from the land of Moab; and I have caused wine to fail from the winepresses: none shall tread with shouting; <span class='add'>their</span> shouting <span class='add'>shall be</span> no shouting.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&nbsp;</span>From the cry of Heshbon <span class='add'>even</span> unto Elealeh, <span class='add'>and even</span> unto Jahaz, have they uttered their voice, from Zoar <span class='add'>even</span> unto Horonaim, <span class='add'>as</span> an heifer of three years old: for the waters also of Nimrim shall be desolate.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&nbsp;</span>Moreover I will cause to cease in Moab, saith the LORD, him that offereth in the high places, and him that burneth incense to his gods.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&nbsp;</span>Therefore mine heart shall sound for Moab like pipes, and mine heart shall sound like pipes for the men of Kir-heres: because the riches <span class='add'>that</span> he hath gotten are perished.  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&nbsp;</span>For every head <span class='add'>shall be</span> bald, and every beard clipped: upon all the hands <span class='add'>shall be</span> cuttings, and upon the loins sackcloth.  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&nbsp;</span> <span class='add'>There shall be</span> lamentation generally upon all the housetops of Moab, and in the streets thereof: for I have broken Moab like a vessel wherein <span class='add'>is</span> no pleasure, saith the LORD.  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&nbsp;</span>They shall howl, <span class='add'>saying</span>, How is it broken down! how hath Moab turned the back with shame! so shall Moab be a derision and a dismaying to all them about him.  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&nbsp;</span>For thus saith the LORD; Behold, he shall fly as an eagle, and shall spread his wings over Moab.  <span class="verse" id="V41">41&nbsp;</span>Kerioth is taken, and the strong holds are surprised, and the mighty men’s hearts in Moab at that day shall be as the heart of a woman in her pangs.  <span class="verse" id="V42">42&nbsp;</span>And Moab shall be destroyed from <span class='add'>being</span> a people, because he hath magnified <span class='add'>himself</span> against the LORD.  <span class="verse" id="V43">43&nbsp;</span>Fear, and the pit, and the snare, <span class='add'>shall be</span> upon thee, O inhabitant of Moab, saith the LORD.  <span class="verse" id="V44">44&nbsp;</span>He that fleeth from the fear shall fall into the pit; and he that getteth up out of the pit shall be taken in the snare: for I will bring upon it, <span class='add'>even</span> upon Moab, the year of their visitation, saith the LORD.  <span class="verse" id="V45">45&nbsp;</span>They that fled stood under the shadow of Heshbon because of the force: but a fire shall come forth out of Heshbon, and a flame from the midst of Sihon, and shall devour the corner of Moab, and the crown of the head of the tumultuous ones.  <span class="verse" id="V46">46&nbsp;</span>Woe be unto thee, O Moab! the people of Chemosh perisheth: for thy sons are taken captives, and thy daughters captives.  <span class="verse" id="V47">47&nbsp;</span>Yet will I bring again the captivity of Moab in the latter days, saith the LORD.
