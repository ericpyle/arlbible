 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C48V1">&nbsp;</a>Against Moab thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Woe unto Nebo! for it is spoiled: Kiriathaim
is confounded
<span class="add">and</span> taken: Misgab is confounded and dismayed.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C48V2">&nbsp;</a><span class="add">There shall be</span> no more praise of Moab: in Heshbon they have devised evil against it; come, and let us cut it off from
<span class="add">being</span> a nation. Also thou shalt be cut down, O Madmen; the sword shall pursue thee.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C48V3">&nbsp;</a>A voice of crying
<span class="add">shall be</span> from Horonaim, spoiling and great destruction.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C48V4">&nbsp;</a>Moab is destroyed; her little ones have caused a cry to be heard.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C48V5">&nbsp;</a>For in the going up of Luhith continual weeping shall go up; for in the going down of Horonaim the enemies
have heard a cry of destruction.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C48V6">&nbsp;</a>Flee, save your lives, and be like the heath in the wilderness.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C48V7">&nbsp;</a>For because thou hast trusted in thy works and in thy treasures, thou shalt also be taken: and Chemosh
shall go forth into captivity
<span class="add">with</span> his priests and his princes together.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C48V8">&nbsp;</a>And the spoiler shall come upon every city, and no city shall escape: the valley also shall perish, and
the plain shall be destroyed, as the LORD hath spoken.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C48V9">&nbsp;</a>Give wings unto Moab, that it may flee and get away: for the cities thereof shall be desolate, without
any to dwell therein.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C48V10">&nbsp;</a>Cursed
<span class="add">be</span> he that doeth the work of the LORD deceitfully, and cursed
<span class="add">be</span> he that keepeth back his sword from blood.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C48V11">&nbsp;</a>Moab hath been at ease from his youth, and he hath settled on his lees, and hath not been emptied from
vessel to vessel, neither hath he gone into captivity: therefore his taste remained in him, and his scent
is not changed.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C48V12">&nbsp;</a>Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will send unto him wanderers, that shall cause
him to wander, and shall empty his vessels, and break their bottles.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C48V13">&nbsp;</a>And Moab shall be ashamed of Chemosh, as the house of Israel was ashamed of Bethel their confidence.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C48V14">&nbsp;</a>How say ye, We
<span class="add">are</span> mighty and strong men for the war?
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C48V15">&nbsp;</a>Moab is spoiled, and gone up
<span class="add">out of</span> her cities, and his chosen young men are gone down to the slaughter, saith the King, whose name
<span class="add">is</span> the LORD of hosts.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C48V16">&nbsp;</a>The calamity of Moab
<span class="add">is</span> near to come, and his affliction hasteth fast.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C48V17">&nbsp;</a>All ye that are about him, bemoan him; and all ye that know his name, say, How is the strong staff broken,
<span class="add">and</span> the beautiful rod!
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C48V18">&nbsp;</a>Thou daughter that dost inhabit Dibon, come down from
<span class="add">thy</span> glory, and sit in thirst; for the spoiler of Moab shall come upon thee,
<span class="add">and</span> he shall destroy thy strong holds.
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C48V19">&nbsp;</a>O inhabitant of Aroer, stand by the way, and espy; ask him that fleeth, and her that escapeth,
<span class="add">and</span> say, What is done?
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C48V20">&nbsp;</a>Moab is confounded; for it is broken down: howl and cry; and tell ye it in Arnon, that Moab is spoiled,
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C48V21">&nbsp;</a>And judgment is come upon the plain country; upon Holon, and upon Jahazah, and upon Mephaath,
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C48V22">&nbsp;</a>And upon Dibon, and upon Nebo, and upon Beth-diblathaim,
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C48V23">&nbsp;</a>And upon Kiriathaim, and upon Beth-gamul, and upon Beth-meon,
 <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C48V24">&nbsp;</a>And upon Kerioth, and upon Bozrah, and upon all the cities of the land of Moab, far or near.
 <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C48V25">&nbsp;</a>The horn of Moab is cut off, and his arm is broken, saith the LORD.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C48V26">&nbsp;</a>Make ye him drunken: for he magnified
<span class="add">himself</span> against the LORD: Moab also shall wallow in his vomit, and he also shall be in derision.
 <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C48V27">&nbsp;</a>For was not Israel a derision unto thee? was he found among thieves? for since thou spakest of him, thou
skippedst for joy.
 <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C48V28">&nbsp;</a>O ye that dwell in Moab, leave the cities, and dwell in the rock, and be like the dove
<span class="add">that</span> maketh her nest in the sides of the hole’s mouth.
 <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C48V29">&nbsp;</a>We have heard the pride of Moab, (he is exceeding proud) his loftiness, and his arrogancy, and his pride,
and the haughtiness of his heart.
 <span class="verse"> 30</span><a name="C48V30">&nbsp;</a>I know his wrath, saith the LORD; but
<span class="add">it shall</span> not
<span class="add">be</span> so; his lies shall not so effect
<span class="add">it.
</span> <span class="verse"> 31</span><a name="C48V31">&nbsp;</a>Therefore will I howl for Moab, and I will cry out for all Moab;
<span class="add">mine heart</span> shall mourn for the men of Kir-heres.
 <span class="verse"> 32</span><a name="C48V32">&nbsp;</a>O vine of Sibmah, I will weep for thee with the weeping of Jazer: thy plants are gone over the sea, they
reach
<span class="add">even</span> to the sea of Jazer: the spoiler is fallen upon thy summer fruits and upon thy vintage.
 <span class="verse"> 33</span><a name="C48V33">&nbsp;</a>And joy and gladness is taken from the plentiful field, and from the land of Moab; and I have caused
wine to fail from the winepresses: none shall tread with shouting;
<span class="add">their</span> shouting
<span class="add">shall be</span> no shouting.
 <span class="verse"> 34</span><a name="C48V34">&nbsp;</a>From the cry of Heshbon
<span class="add">even</span> unto Elealeh,
<span class="add">and even</span> unto Jahaz, have they uttered their voice, from Zoar
<span class="add">even</span> unto Horonaim,
<span class="add">as</span> an heifer of three years old: for the waters also of Nimrim shall be desolate.
 <span class="verse"> 35</span><a name="C48V35">&nbsp;</a>Moreover I will cause to cease in Moab, saith the LORD, him that offereth in the high places, and him
that burneth incense to his gods.
 <span class="verse"> 36</span><a name="C48V36">&nbsp;</a>Therefore mine heart shall sound for Moab like pipes, and mine heart shall sound like pipes for the men
of Kir-heres: because the riches
<span class="add">that</span> he hath gotten are perished.
 <span class="verse"> 37</span><a name="C48V37">&nbsp;</a>For every head
<span class="add">shall be</span> bald, and every beard clipped: upon all the hands
<span class="add">shall be</span> cuttings, and upon the loins sackcloth.
 <span class="verse"> 38</span><a name="C48V38">&nbsp;</a><span class="add">There shall be</span> lamentation generally upon all the housetops of Moab, and in the streets thereof: for I have broken
Moab like a vessel wherein
<span class="add">is</span> no pleasure, saith the LORD.
 <span class="verse"> 39</span><a name="C48V39">&nbsp;</a>They shall howl,
<span class="add">saying,</span> How is it broken down! how hath Moab turned the back with shame! so shall Moab be a derision and a dismaying
to all them about him.
 <span class="verse"> 40</span><a name="C48V40">&nbsp;</a>For thus saith the LORD; Behold, he shall fly as an eagle, and shall spread his wings over Moab.
 <span class="verse"> 41</span><a name="C48V41">&nbsp;</a>Kerioth is taken, and the strong holds are surprised, and the mighty men’s hearts in Moab at that day
shall be as the heart of a woman in her pangs.
 <span class="verse"> 42</span><a name="C48V42">&nbsp;</a>And Moab shall be destroyed from
<span class="add">being</span> a people, because he hath magnified
<span class="add">himself</span> against the LORD.
 <span class="verse"> 43</span><a name="C48V43">&nbsp;</a>Fear, and the pit, and the snare,
<span class="add">shall be</span> upon thee, O inhabitant of Moab, saith the LORD.
 <span class="verse"> 44</span><a name="C48V44">&nbsp;</a>He that fleeth from the fear shall fall into the pit; and he that getteth up out of the pit shall be
taken in the snare: for I will bring upon it,
<span class="add">even</span> upon Moab, the year of their visitation, saith the LORD.
 <span class="verse"> 45</span><a name="C48V45">&nbsp;</a>They that fled stood under the shadow of Heshbon because of the force: but a fire shall come forth out
of Heshbon, and a flame from the midst of Sihon, and shall devour the corner of Moab, and the crown of
the head of the tumultuous ones.
 <span class="verse"> 46</span><a name="C48V46">&nbsp;</a>Woe be unto thee, O Moab! the people of Chemosh perisheth: for thy sons are taken captives, and thy daughters
captives.
 <span class="verse"> 47</span><a name="C48V47">&nbsp;</a>Yet will I bring again the captivity of Moab in the latter days, saith the LORD. Thus far
<span class="add">is</span> the judgment of Moab.
