 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C5V1">&nbsp;</a>Remember, O LORD, what is come upon us: consider, and behold our reproach.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C5V2">&nbsp;</a>Our inheritance is turned to strangers, our houses to aliens.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C5V3">&nbsp;</a>We are orphans and fatherless, our mothers
<span class="add">are</span> as widows.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C5V4">&nbsp;</a>We have drunken our water for money; our wood is sold unto us.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C5V5">&nbsp;</a>Our necks
<span class="add">are</span> under persecution: we labour,
<span class="add">and
</span> have no rest.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C5V6">&nbsp;</a>We have given the hand
<span class="add">to</span> the Egyptians,
<span class="add">and to
</span> the Assyrians, to be satisfied with bread.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C5V7">&nbsp;</a>Our fathers have sinned,
<span class="add">and are</span> not; and we have borne their iniquities.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C5V8">&nbsp;</a>Servants have ruled over us:
<span class="add">there is</span> none that doth deliver
<span class="add">us</span> out of their hand.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C5V9">&nbsp;</a>We gat our bread with
<span class="add">the peril of</span> our lives because of the sword of the wilderness.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C5V10">&nbsp;</a>Our skin was black like an oven because of the terrible famine.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C5V11">&nbsp;</a>They ravished the women in Zion,
<span class="add">and</span> the maids in the cities of Judah.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C5V12">&nbsp;</a>Princes are hanged up by their hand: the faces of elders were not honoured.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C5V13">&nbsp;</a>They took the young men to grind, and the children fell under the wood.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C5V14">&nbsp;</a>The elders have ceased from the gate, the young men from their musick.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C5V15">&nbsp;</a>The joy of our heart is ceased; our dance is turned into mourning.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C5V16">&nbsp;</a>The crown is fallen
<span class="add">from</span> our head: woe unto us, that we have sinned!
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C5V17">&nbsp;</a>For this our heart is faint; for these
<span class="add">things</span> our eyes are dim.
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C5V18">&nbsp;</a>Because of the mountain of Zion, which is desolate, the foxes walk upon it.
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C5V19">&nbsp;</a>Thou, O LORD, remainest for ever; thy throne from generation to generation.
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C5V20">&nbsp;</a>Wherefore dost thou forget us for ever,
<span class="add">and</span> forsake us so long time?
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C5V21">&nbsp;</a>Turn thou us unto thee, O LORD, and we shall be turned; renew our days as of old.
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C5V22">&nbsp;</a>But thou hast utterly rejected us; thou art very wroth against us.
