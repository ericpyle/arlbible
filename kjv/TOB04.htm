<div class="chapterlabel"> 4</div><div class="p">
 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C4V1">&nbsp;</a>In that day Tobit remembered the money which he had committed to Gabael in Rages of Media,
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C4V2">&nbsp;</a>And said with himself, I have wished for death; wherefore do I not call for my son Tobias that I may
signify to him of the money before I die?
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C4V3">&nbsp;</a>And when he had called him, he said, My son, when I am dead, bury me; and despise not thy mother, but
honour her all the days of thy life, and do that which shall please her, and grieve her not.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C4V4">&nbsp;</a>Remember, my son, that she saw many dangers for thee, when thou wast in her womb: and when she is dead,
bury her by me in one grave.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C4V5">&nbsp;</a>My son, be mindful of the Lord our God all thy days, and let not thy will be set to sin, or to transgress
his commandments: do uprightly all thy life long, and follow not the ways of unrighteousness.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C4V6">&nbsp;</a>For if thou deal truly, thy doings shall prosperously succeed to thee, and to all them that live justly.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C4V7">&nbsp;</a>Give alms of thy substance; and when thou givest alms, let not thine eye be envious, neither turn thy
face from any poor, and the face of God shall not be turned away from thee.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C4V8">&nbsp;</a>If thou hast abundance give alms accordingly: if thou have but a little, be not afraid to give according
to that little:
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C4V9">&nbsp;</a>For thou layest up a good treasure for thyself against the day of necessity.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C4V10">&nbsp;</a>Because that alms do deliver from death, and suffereth not to come into darkness.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C4V11">&nbsp;</a>For alms is a good gift unto all that give it in the sight of the most High.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C4V12">&nbsp;</a>Beware of all whoredom, my son, and chiefly take a wife of the seed of thy fathers, and take not a strange
woman to wife, which is not of thy father’s tribe: for we are the children of the prophets, Noe, Abraham,
Isaac, and Jacob: remember, my son, that our fathers from the beginning, even that they all married wives
of their own kindred, and were blessed in their children, and their seed shall inherit the land.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C4V13">&nbsp;</a>Now therefore, my son, love thy brethren, and despise not in thy heart thy brethren, the sons and daughters
of thy people, in not taking a wife of them: for in pride is destruction and much trouble, and in lewdness
is decay and great want: for lewdness is the mother of famine.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C4V14">&nbsp;</a>Let not the wages of any man, which hath wrought for thee, tarry with thee, but give him it out of hand:
for if thou serve God, he will also repay thee: be circumspect my son, in all things thou doest, and
be wise in all thy conversation.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C4V15">&nbsp;</a>Do that to no man which thou hatest: drink not wine to make thee drunken: neither let drunkenness go
with thee in thy journey.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C4V16">&nbsp;</a>Give of thy bread to the hungry, and of thy garments to them that are naked; and according to thine abundance
give alms: and let not thine eye be envious, when thou givest alms.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C4V17">&nbsp;</a>Pour out thy bread on the burial of the just, but give nothing to the wicked.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C4V18">&nbsp;</a>Ask counsel of all that are wise, and despise not any counsel that is profitable.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C4V19">&nbsp;</a>Bless the Lord thy God alway, and desire of him that thy ways may be directed, and that all thy paths
and counsels may prosper: for every nation hath not counsel; but the Lord himself giveth all good things,
and he humbleth whom he will, as he will; now therefore, my son, remember my commandments, neither let
them be put out of thy mind.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C4V20">&nbsp;</a>And now I signify this to they that I committed ten talents to Gabael the son of Gabrias at Rages in
Media.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C4V21">&nbsp;</a>And fear not, my son, that we are made poor: for thou hast much wealth, if thou fear God, and depart
from all sin, and do that which is pleasing in his sight.
