 <span class="verse" id="V1">1&nbsp;</span>Then sang Deborah and Barak the son of Abinoam on that day, saying,  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span>Praise ye the LORD for the avenging of Israel, when the people willingly offered themselves.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>Hear, O ye kings; give ear, O ye princes; I, <span class='add'>even</span> I, will sing unto the LORD; I will sing <span class='add'>praise</span> to the LORD God of Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>LORD, when thou wentest out of Seir, when thou marchedst out of the field of Edom, the earth trembled, and the heavens dropped, the clouds also dropped water.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>The mountains melted from before the LORD, <span class='add'>even</span> that Sinai from before the LORD God of Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>In the days of Shamgar the son of Anath, in the days of Jael, the highways were unoccupied, and the travelers walked through byways.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span> <span class='add'>The inhabitants of</span> the villages ceased, they ceased in Israel, until that I Deborah arose, that I arose a mother in Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>They chose new gods; then <span class='add'>was</span> war in the gates: was there a shield or spear seen among forty thousand in Israel?  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>My heart <span class='add'>is</span> toward the governors of Israel, that offered themselves willingly among the people. Bless ye the LORD.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>Speak, ye that ride on white asses, ye that sit in judgment, and walk by the way.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span> <span class='add'>They that are delivered</span> from the noise of archers in the places of drawing water, there shall they rehearse the righteous acts of the LORD, <span class='add'>even</span> the righteous acts <span class='add'>toward the inhabitants</span> of his villages in Israel: then shall the people of the LORD go down to the gates.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>Awake, awake, Deborah: awake, awake, utter a song: arise, Barak, and lead thy captivity captive, thou son of Abinoam.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>Then he made him that remaineth have dominion over the nobles among the people: the LORD made me have dominion over the mighty.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>Out of Ephraim <span class='add'>was there</span> a root of them against Amalek; after thee, Benjamin, among thy people; out of Machir came down governors, and out of Zebulun they that handle the pen of the writer.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>And the princes of Issachar <span class='add'>were</span> with Deborah; even Issachar, and also Barak: he was sent on foot into the valley. For the divisions of Reuben <span class='add'>there were</span> great thoughts of heart.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>Why abodest thou among the sheepfolds, to hear the bleatings of the flocks? For the divisions of Reuben <span class='add'>there were</span> great searchings of heart.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>Gilead abode beyond Jordan: and why did Dan remain in ships? Asher continued on the sea shore, and abode in his breaches.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>Zebulun and Naphtali <span class='add'>were</span> a people <span class='add'>that</span> jeoparded their lives unto the death in the high places of the field.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>The kings came <span class='add'>and</span> fought, then fought the kings of Canaan in Taanach by the waters of Megiddo; they took no gain of money.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>They fought from heaven; the stars in their courses fought against Sisera.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>The river of Kishon swept them away, that ancient river, the river Kishon. O my soul, thou hast trodden down strength.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>Then were the horsehoofs broken by the means of the pransings, the pransings of their mighty ones.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>Curse ye Meroz, said the angel of the LORD, curse ye bitterly the inhabitants thereof; because they came not to the help of the LORD, to the help of the LORD against the mighty.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>Blessed above women shall Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite be, blessed shall she be above women in the tent.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>He asked water, <span class='add'>and</span> she gave <span class='add'>him</span> milk; she brought forth butter in a lordly dish.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>She put her hand to the nail, and her right hand to the workmen’s hammer; and with the hammer she smote Sisera, she smote off his head, when she had pierced and stricken through his temples.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>At her feet he bowed, he fell, he lay down: at her feet he bowed, he fell: where he bowed, there he fell down dead.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&nbsp;</span>The mother of Sisera looked out at a window, and cried through the lattice, Why is his chariot <span class='add'>so</span> long in coming? why tarry the wheels of his chariots?  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&nbsp;</span>Her wise ladies answered her, yea, she returned answer to herself,  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&nbsp;</span>Have they not sped? have they <span class='add'>not</span> divided the prey; to every man a damsel <span class='add'>or</span> two; to Sisera a prey of divers colours, a prey of divers colours of needlework, of divers colours of needlework on both sides, <span class='add'>meet</span> for the necks of <span class='add'>them that take</span> the spoil?  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&nbsp;</span>So let all thine enemies perish, O LORD: but <span class='add'>let</span> them that love him <span class='add'>be</span> as the sun when he goeth forth in his might. And the land had rest forty years. </div><ul class='tnav'>
