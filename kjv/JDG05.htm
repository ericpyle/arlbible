 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C5V1">&nbsp;</a>Then sang Deborah and Barak the son of Abinoam on that day, saying,
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C5V2">&nbsp;</a>Praise ye the LORD for the avenging of Israel, when the people willingly offered themselves.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C5V3">&nbsp;</a>Hear, O ye kings; give ear, O ye princes; I,
<span class="add">even</span> I, will sing unto the LORD; I will sing
<span class="add">praise</span> to the LORD God of Israel.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C5V4">&nbsp;</a>LORD, when thou wentest out of Seir, when thou marchedst out of the field of Edom, the earth trembled,
and the heavens dropped, the clouds also dropped water.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C5V5">&nbsp;</a>The mountains melted from before the LORD,
<span class="add">even</span> that Sinai from before the LORD God of Israel.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C5V6">&nbsp;</a>In the days of Shamgar the son of Anath, in the days of Jael, the highways were unoccupied, and the travelers
walked through byways.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C5V7">&nbsp;</a><span class="add">The inhabitants of</span> the villages ceased, they ceased in Israel, until that I Deborah arose, that I arose a mother in Israel.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C5V8">&nbsp;</a>They chose new gods; then
<span class="add">was</span> war in the gates: was there a shield or spear seen among forty thousand in Israel?
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C5V9">&nbsp;</a>My heart
<span class="add">is</span> toward the governors of Israel, that offered themselves willingly among the people. Bless ye the LORD.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C5V10">&nbsp;</a>Speak, ye that ride on white asses, ye that sit in judgment, and walk by the way.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C5V11">&nbsp;</a><span class="add">They that are delivered</span> from the noise of archers in the places of drawing water, there shall they rehearse the righteous acts
of the LORD,
<span class="add">even</span> the righteous acts
<span class="add">toward the inhabitants
</span> of his villages in Israel: then shall the people of the LORD go down to the gates.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C5V12">&nbsp;</a>Awake, awake, Deborah: awake, awake, utter a song: arise, Barak, and lead thy captivity captive, thou
son of Abinoam.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C5V13">&nbsp;</a>Then he made him that remaineth have dominion over the nobles among the people: the LORD made me have
dominion over the mighty.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C5V14">&nbsp;</a>Out of Ephraim
<span class="add">was there</span> a root of them against Amalek; after thee, Benjamin, among thy people; out of Machir came down governors,
and out of Zebulun they that handle the pen of the writer.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C5V15">&nbsp;</a>And the princes of Issachar
<span class="add">were</span> with Deborah; even Issachar, and also Barak: he was sent on foot into the valley. For the divisions
of Reuben
<span class="add">there were</span> great thoughts of heart.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C5V16">&nbsp;</a>Why abodest thou among the sheepfolds, to hear the bleatings of the flocks? For the divisions of Reuben
<span class="add">there were</span> great searchings of heart.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C5V17">&nbsp;</a>Gilead abode beyond Jordan: and why did Dan remain in ships? Asher continued on the sea shore, and abode
in his breaches.
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C5V18">&nbsp;</a>Zebulun and Naphtali
<span class="add">were</span> a people
<span class="add">that</span> jeoparded their lives unto the death in the high places of the field.
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C5V19">&nbsp;</a>The kings came
<span class="add">and</span> fought, then fought the kings of Canaan in Taanach by the waters of Megiddo; they took no gain of money.
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C5V20">&nbsp;</a>They fought from heaven; the stars in their courses fought against Sisera.
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C5V21">&nbsp;</a>The river of Kishon swept them away, that ancient river, the river Kishon. O my soul, thou hast trodden
down strength.
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C5V22">&nbsp;</a>Then were the horsehoofs broken by the means of the pransings, the pransings of their mighty ones.
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C5V23">&nbsp;</a>Curse ye Meroz, said the angel of the LORD, curse ye bitterly the inhabitants thereof; because they came
not to the help of the LORD, to the help of the LORD against the mighty.
 <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C5V24">&nbsp;</a>Blessed above women shall Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite be, blessed shall she be above women in the
tent.
 <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C5V25">&nbsp;</a>He asked water,
<span class="add">and</span> she gave
<span class="add">him</span> milk; she brought forth butter in a lordly dish.
 <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C5V26">&nbsp;</a>She put her hand to the nail, and her right hand to the workmen’s hammer; and with the hammer she smote
Sisera, she smote off his head, when she had pierced and stricken through his temples.
 <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C5V27">&nbsp;</a>At her feet he bowed, he fell, he lay down: at her feet he bowed, he fell: where he bowed, there he fell
down dead.
 <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C5V28">&nbsp;</a>The mother of Sisera looked out at a window, and cried through the lattice, Why is his chariot
<span class="add">so</span> long in coming? why tarry the wheels of his chariots?
 <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C5V29">&nbsp;</a>Her wise ladies answered her, yea, she returned answer to herself,
 <span class="verse"> 30</span><a name="C5V30">&nbsp;</a>Have they not sped? have they
<span class="add">not</span> divided the prey; to every man a damsel
<span class="add">or</span> two; to Sisera a prey of divers colours, a prey of divers colours of needlework, of divers colours of
needlework on both sides,
<span class="add">meet</span> for the necks of
<span class="add">them that take</span> the spoil?
 <span class="verse"> 31</span><a name="C5V31">&nbsp;</a>So let all thine enemies perish, O LORD: but
<span class="add">let</span> them that love him
<span class="add">be</span> as the sun when he goeth forth in his might. And the land had rest forty years.
