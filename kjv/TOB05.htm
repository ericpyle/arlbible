<div class="chapterlabel"> 5</div><div class="p">
 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C5V1">&nbsp;</a>Tobias then answered and said, Father, I will do all things which thou hast commanded me:
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C5V2">&nbsp;</a>But how can I receive the money, seeing I know him not?
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C5V3">&nbsp;</a>Then he gave him the handwriting, and said unto him, Seek thee a man which may go with thee, whiles I
yet live, and I will give him wages: and go and receive the money.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C5V4">&nbsp;</a>Therefore when he went to seek a man, he found Raphael that was an angel.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C5V5">&nbsp;</a>But he knew not; and he said unto him, Canst thou go with me to Rages? and knowest thou those places
well?
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C5V6">&nbsp;</a>To whom the angel said, I will go with thee, and I know the way well: for I have lodged with our brother
Gabael.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C5V7">&nbsp;</a>Then Tobias said unto him, Tarry for me, till I tell my father.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C5V8">&nbsp;</a>Then he said unto him, Go and tarry not. So he went in and said to his father, Behold, I have found one
which will go with me. Then he said, Call him unto me, that I may know of what tribe he is, and whether
he be a trusty man to go with thee.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C5V9">&nbsp;</a>So he called him, and he came in, and they saluted one another.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C5V10">&nbsp;</a>Then Tobit said unto him, Brother, shew me of what tribe and family thou art.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C5V11">&nbsp;</a>To whom he said, Dost thou seek for a tribe or family, or an hired man to go with thy son? Then Tobit
said unto him, I would know, brother, thy kindred and name.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C5V12">&nbsp;</a>Then he said, I am Azarias, the son of Ananias the great, and of thy brethren.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C5V13">&nbsp;</a>Then Tobit said, Thou art welcome, brother; be not now angry with me, because I have enquired to know
thy tribe and thy family; for thou art my brother, of an honest and good stock: for I know Ananias and
Jonathas, sons of that great Samaias, as we went together to Jerusalem to worship, and offered the firstborn,
and the tenths of the fruits; and they were not seduced with the error of our brethren: my brother, thou
art of a good stock.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C5V14">&nbsp;</a>But tell me, what wages shall I give thee? wilt thou a drachm a day, and things necessary, as to mine
own son?
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C5V15">&nbsp;</a>Yea, moreover, if ye return safe, I will add something to thy wages.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C5V16">&nbsp;</a>So they were well pleased. Then said he to Tobias, Prepare thyself for the journey, and God send you
a good journey. And when his son had prepared all things for the journey, his father said, Go thou with
this man, and God, which dwelleth in heaven, prosper your journey, and the angel of God keep you company.
So they went forth both, and the young man’s dog with them.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C5V17">&nbsp;</a>But Anna his mother wept, and said to Tobit, Why hast thou sent away our son? is he not the staff of
our hand, in going in and out before us?
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C5V18">&nbsp;</a>Be not greedy to add money to money: but let it be as refuse in respect of our child.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C5V19">&nbsp;</a>For that which the Lord hath given us to live with doth suffice us.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C5V20">&nbsp;</a>Then said Tobit to her, Take no care, my sister; he shall return in safety, and thine eyes shall see
him.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C5V21">&nbsp;</a>For the good angel will keep him company, and his journey shall be prosperous, and he shall return safe.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C5V22">&nbsp;</a>Then she made an end of weeping.
