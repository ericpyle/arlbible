 <span class="verse" id="V1">1&nbsp;</span>So these three men ceased to answer Job, because he <span class='add'>was</span> righteous in his own eyes.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span>Then was kindled the wrath of Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite, of the kindred of Ram: against Job was his wrath kindled, because he justified himself rather than God.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>Also against his three friends was his wrath kindled, because they had found no answer, and yet had condemned Job.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>Now Elihu had waited till Job had spoken, because they were elder than he.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>When Elihu saw that <span class='add'>there was</span> no answer in the mouth of <span class='add'>these</span> three men, then his wrath was kindled.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>And Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite answered and said, I <span class='add'>am</span> young, and ye <span class='add'>are</span> very old; wherefore I was afraid, and durst not shew you mine opinion.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>I said, Days should speak, and multitude of years should teach wisdom.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>But <span class='add'>there is</span> a spirit in man: and the inspiration of the Almighty giveth them understanding.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>Great men are not <span class='add'>always</span> wise: neither do the aged understand judgment.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>Therefore I said, Hearken to me; I also will shew mine opinion.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>Behold, I waited for your words; I gave ear to your reasons, whilst ye searched out what to say.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>Yea, I attended unto you, and, behold, <span class='add'>there was</span> none of you that convinced Job, or that answered his words:  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>Lest ye should say, We have found out wisdom: God thrusteth him down, not man.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>Now he hath not directed <span class='add'>his</span> words against me: neither will I answer him with your speeches.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>They were amazed, they answered no more: they left off speaking.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>When I had waited, (for they spake not, but stood still, <span class='add'>and</span> answered no more;)  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span> <span class='add'>I said</span>, I will answer also my part, I also will shew mine opinion.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>For I am full of matter, the spirit within me constraineth me.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>Behold, my belly <span class='add'>is</span> as wine <span class='add'>which</span> hath no vent; it is ready to burst like new bottles.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>I will speak, that I may be refreshed: I will open my lips and answer.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>Let me not, I pray you, accept any man’s person, neither let me give flattering titles unto man.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>For I know not to give flattering titles; <span class='add'>in so doing</span> my maker would soon take me away. </div><ul class='tnav'>
