 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C2V1">&nbsp;</a>And now, O ye priests, this commandment
<span class="add">is</span> for you.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C2V2">&nbsp;</a>If ye will not hear, and if ye will not lay
<span class="add">it</span> to heart, to give glory unto my name, saith the LORD of hosts, I will even send a curse upon you, and
I will curse your blessings: yea, I have cursed them already, because ye do not lay
<span class="add">it</span> to heart.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C2V3">&nbsp;</a>Behold, I will corrupt your seed, and spread dung upon your faces,
<span class="add">even</span> the dung of your solemn feasts; and
<span class="add">one</span> shall take you away with it.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C2V4">&nbsp;</a>And ye shall know that I have sent this commandment unto you, that my covenant might be with Levi, saith
the LORD of hosts.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C2V5">&nbsp;</a>My covenant was with him of life and peace; and I gave them to him
<span class="add">for</span> the fear wherewith he feared me, and was afraid before my name.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C2V6">&nbsp;</a>The law of truth was in his mouth, and iniquity was not found in his lips: he walked with me in peace
and equity, and did turn many away from iniquity.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C2V7">&nbsp;</a>For the priest’s lips should keep knowledge, and they should seek the law at his mouth: for he
<span class="add">is</span> the messenger of the LORD of hosts.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C2V8">&nbsp;</a>But ye are departed out of the way; ye have caused many to stumble at the law; ye have corrupted the
covenant of Levi, saith the LORD of hosts.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C2V9">&nbsp;</a>Therefore have I also made you contemptible and base before all the people, according as ye have not
kept my ways, but have been partial in the law.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C2V10">&nbsp;</a>Have we not all one father? hath not one God created us? why do we deal treacherously every man against
his brother, by profaning the covenant of our fathers?
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C2V11">&nbsp;</a>Judah hath dealt treacherously, and an abomination is committed in Israel and in Jerusalem; for Judah
hath profaned the holiness of the LORD which he loved, and hath married the daughter of a strange god.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C2V12">&nbsp;</a>The LORD will cut off the man that doeth this, the master and the scholar, out of the tabernacles of
Jacob, and him that offereth an offering unto the LORD of hosts.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C2V13">&nbsp;</a>And this have ye done again, covering the altar of the LORD with tears, with weeping, and with crying
out, insomuch that he regardeth not the offering any more, or receiveth
<span class="add">it</span> with good will at your hand.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C2V14">&nbsp;</a>Yet ye say, Wherefore? Because the LORD hath been witness between thee and the wife of thy youth, against
whom thou hast dealt treacherously: yet
<span class="add">is</span> she thy companion, and the wife of thy covenant.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C2V15">&nbsp;</a>And did not he make one? Yet had he the residue of the spirit. And wherefore one? That he might seek
a godly seed. Therefore take heed to your spirit, and let none deal treacherously against the wife of
his youth.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C2V16">&nbsp;</a>For the LORD, the God of Israel, saith that he hateth putting away: for
<span class="add">one</span> covereth violence with his garment, saith the LORD of hosts: therefore take heed to your spirit, that
ye deal not treacherously.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C2V17">&nbsp;</a>Ye have wearied the LORD with your words. Yet ye say, Wherein have we wearied
<span class="add">him?</span> When ye say, Every one that doeth evil
<span class="add">is</span> good in the sight of the LORD, and he delighteth in them; or, Where
<span class="add">is</span> the God of judgment?
