 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C12V1">&nbsp;</a>And the men of Ephraim gathered themselves together, and went northward, and said unto Jephthah, Wherefore
passedst thou over to fight against the children of Ammon, and didst not call us to go with thee? we
will burn thine house upon thee with fire.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C12V2">&nbsp;</a>And Jephthah said unto them, I and my people were at great strife with the children of Ammon; and when
I called you, ye delivered me not out of their hands.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C12V3">&nbsp;</a>And when I saw that ye delivered
<span class="add">me</span> not, I put my life in my hands, and passed over against the children of Ammon, and the LORD delivered
them into my hand: wherefore then are ye come up unto me this day, to fight against me?
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C12V4">&nbsp;</a>Then Jephthah gathered together all the men of Gilead, and fought with Ephraim: and the men of Gilead
smote Ephraim, because they said, Ye Gileadites
<span class="add">are</span> fugitives of Ephraim among the Ephraimites,
<span class="add">and</span> among the Manassites.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C12V5">&nbsp;</a>And the Gileadites took the passages of Jordan before the Ephraimites: and it was
<span class="add">so,</span> that when those Ephraimites which were escaped said, Let me go over; that the men of Gilead said unto
him,
<span class="add">Art</span> thou an Ephraimite? If he said, Nay;
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C12V6">&nbsp;</a>Then said they unto him, Say now Shibboleth: and he said Sibboleth: for he could not frame to pronounce
<span class="add">it</span> right. Then they took him, and slew him at the passages of Jordan: and there fell at that time of the
Ephraimites forty and two thousand.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C12V7">&nbsp;</a>And Jephthah judged Israel six years. Then died Jephthah the Gileadite, and was buried in
<span class="add">one of</span> the cities of Gilead.

<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C12V8">&nbsp;</a>And after him Ibzan of Bethlehem judged Israel.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C12V9">&nbsp;</a>And he had thirty sons, and thirty daughters,
<span class="add">whom</span> he sent abroad, and took in thirty daughters from abroad for his sons. And he judged Israel seven years.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C12V10">&nbsp;</a>Then died Ibzan, and was buried at Bethlehem.

<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C12V11">&nbsp;</a>And after him Elon, a Zebulonite, judged Israel; and he judged Israel ten years.

<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C12V13">&nbsp;</a>And after him Abdon the son of Hillel, a Pirathonite, judged Israel.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C12V14">&nbsp;</a>And he had forty sons and thirty nephews, that rode on threescore and ten ass colts: and he judged Israel
eight years.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C12V15">&nbsp;</a>And Abdon the son of Hillel the Pirathonite died, and was buried in Pirathon in the land of Ephraim,
in the mount of the Amalekites.
