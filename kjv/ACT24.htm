 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C24V1">&nbsp;</a>And after five days Ananias the high priest descended with the elders, and
<span class="add">with</span> a certain orator
<span class="add">named</span> Tertullus, who informed the governor against Paul.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C24V2">&nbsp;</a>And when he was called forth, Tertullus began to accuse
<span class="add">him,
</span> saying, Seeing that by thee we enjoy great quietness, and that very worthy deeds are done unto this
nation by thy providence,
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C24V3">&nbsp;</a>We accept
<span class="add">it</span> always, and in all places, most noble Felix, with all thankfulness.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C24V4">&nbsp;</a>Notwithstanding, that I be not further tedious unto thee, I pray thee that thou wouldest hear us of thy
clemency a few words.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C24V5">&nbsp;</a>For we have found this man
<span class="add">a</span> pestilent
<span class="add">fellow,</span> and a mover of sedition among all the Jews throughout the world, and a ringleader of the sect of the
Nazarenes:
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C24V6">&nbsp;</a>Who also hath gone about to profane the temple: whom we took, and would have judged according to our
law.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C24V7">&nbsp;</a>But the chief captain Lysias came
<span class="add">upon us,</span> and with great violence took
<span class="add">him</span> away out of our hands,
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C24V8">&nbsp;</a>Commanding his accusers to come unto thee: by examining of whom thyself mayest take knowledge of all
these things, whereof we accuse him.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C24V9">&nbsp;</a>And the Jews also assented, saying that these things were so.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C24V10">&nbsp;</a>Then Paul, after that the governor had beckoned unto him to speak, answered, Forasmuch as I know that
thou hast been of many years a judge unto this nation, I do the more cheerfully answer for myself:
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C24V11">&nbsp;</a>Because that thou mayest understand, that there are yet but twelve days since I went up to Jerusalem
for to worship.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C24V12">&nbsp;</a>And they neither found me in the temple disputing with any man, neither raising up the people, neither
in the synagogues, nor in the city:
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C24V13">&nbsp;</a>Neither can they prove the things whereof they now accuse me.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C24V14">&nbsp;</a>But this I confess unto thee, that after the way which they call heresy, so worship I the God of my fathers,
believing all things which are written in the law and in the prophets:
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C24V15">&nbsp;</a>And have hope toward God, which they themselves also allow, that there shall be a resurrection of the
dead, both of the just and unjust.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C24V16">&nbsp;</a>And herein do I exercise myself, to have always a conscience void of offence toward God, and
<span class="add">toward</span> men.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C24V17">&nbsp;</a>Now after many years I came to bring alms to my nation, and offerings.
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C24V18">&nbsp;</a>Whereupon certain Jews from Asia found me purified in the temple, neither with multitude, nor with tumult.
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C24V19">&nbsp;</a>Who ought to have been here before thee, and object, if they had ought against me.
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C24V20">&nbsp;</a>Or else let these same
<span class="add">here</span> say, if they have found any evil doing in me, while I stood before the council,
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C24V21">&nbsp;</a>Except it be for this one voice, that I cried standing among them, Touching the resurrection of the dead
I am called in question by you this day.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C24V22">&nbsp;</a>And when Felix heard these things, having more perfect knowledge of
<span class="add">that</span> way, he deferred them, and said, When Lysias the chief captain shall come down, I will know the uttermost
of your matter.
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C24V23">&nbsp;</a>And he commanded a centurion to keep Paul, and to let
<span class="add">him
</span> have liberty, and that he should forbid none of his acquaintance to minister or come unto him.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C24V24">&nbsp;</a>And after certain days, when Felix came with his wife Drusilla, which was a Jewess, he sent for Paul,
and heard him concerning the faith in Christ.
 <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C24V25">&nbsp;</a>And as he reasoned of righteousness, temperance, and judgment to come Felix trembled, and answered, Go
thy way for this time; when I have a convenient season, I will call for thee.
 <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C24V26">&nbsp;</a>He hoped also that money should have been given him of Paul, that he might loose him: wherefore he sent
for him the oftener, and communed with him.
 <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C24V27">&nbsp;</a>But after two years Porcius Festus came into Felix’ room: and Felix, willing to shew the Jews a pleasure,
left Paul bound.
