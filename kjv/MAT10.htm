 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C10V1">&nbsp;</a>And when he had called unto
<span class="add">him</span> his twelve disciples, he gave them power
<span class="add">against</span> unclean spirits, to cast them out, and to heal all manner of sickness and all manner of disease.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C10V2">&nbsp;</a>Now the names of the twelve apostles are these; The first, Simon, who is called Peter, and Andrew his
brother; James
<span class="add">the son</span> of Zebedee, and John his brother;
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C10V3">&nbsp;</a>Philip, and Bartholomew; Thomas, and Matthew the publican; James
<span class="add">the son</span> of Alphaeus, and Lebbaeus, whose surname was Thaddaeus;
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C10V4">&nbsp;</a>Simon the Canaanite, and Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed him.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C10V5">&nbsp;</a>These twelve Jesus sent forth, and commanded them, saying,
<span class="wj">Go not into the way of the Gentiles, and into
any city of the Samaritans enter ye not:
</span> <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C10V6">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">But go rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.
</span> <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C10V7">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And as ye go, preach, saying, The kingdom of heaven is at hand.
</span> <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C10V8">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Heal the sick, cleanse the lepers, raise the dead, cast out devils: freely ye have received, freely give.
</span> <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C10V9">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Provide neither gold, nor silver, nor brass in your purses,
</span> <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C10V10">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Nor scrip for
your journey, neither two coats, neither shoes, nor yet staves: for the workman is worthy of his meat.
</span> <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C10V11">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And into whatsoever city or town ye shall enter, enquire who in it is worthy; and there abide till ye
go thence.
</span> <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C10V12">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And when ye come into an house, salute it.
</span> <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C10V13">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And if the house be worthy, let your peace come upon it: but if it be not worthy, let your peace return
to you.
</span> <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C10V14">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And whosoever shall not receive you, nor hear your words, when ye depart out of that house or city, shake
off the dust of your feet.
</span> <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C10V15">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Verily I say unto you, It shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrha in the day of judgment,
than for that city.</span></div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C10V16">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Behold, I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves: be ye therefore wise as serpents, and harmless
as doves.
</span> <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C10V17">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">But beware of men: for they will deliver you up to the councils, and they will scourge you in their synagogues;
</span> <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C10V18">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And ye shall be brought before governors and kings for my sake, for a testimony against them and the
Gentiles.
</span> <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C10V19">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">But when they deliver you up, take no thought how or what ye shall speak: for it shall be given you in
that same hour what ye shall speak.
</span> <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C10V20">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">For it is not ye that speak, but the Spirit of your Father which speaketh in you.
</span> <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C10V21">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And the brother shall deliver up the brother to death, and the father the child: and the children shall
rise up against
their parents, and cause them to be put to death.
</span> <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C10V22">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And ye shall be hated of all
men for my name’s sake: but he that endureth to the end shall be saved.
</span> <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C10V23">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">But when they persecute you in this city, flee ye into another: for verily I say unto you, Ye shall not
have gone over the cities of Israel, till the Son of man be come.
</span> <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C10V24">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">The disciple is not above
his master, nor the servant above his lord.
</span> <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C10V25">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">It is enough for the disciple that he be as his master, and the servant as his lord. If they have called
the master of the house Beelzebub, how much more
shall they call them of his household?
</span> <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C10V26">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Fear them not therefore: for there is nothing covered, that shall not be revealed; and hid, that shall
not be known.
</span> <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C10V27">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">What I tell you in darkness,
that speak ye in light: and what ye hear in the ear,
that preach ye upon the housetops.
</span> <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C10V28">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul: but rather fear him which is
able to destroy both soul and body in hell.
</span> <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C10V29">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Are not two sparrows sold for a farthing? and one of them shall not fall on the ground without your Father.
</span> <span class="verse"> 30</span><a name="C10V30">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">But the very hairs of your head are all numbered.
</span> <span class="verse"> 31</span><a name="C10V31">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Fear ye not therefore, ye are of more value than many sparrows.
</span> <span class="verse"> 32</span><a name="C10V32">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Whosoever therefore shall confess me before men, him will I confess also before my Father which is in
heaven.
</span> <span class="verse"> 33</span><a name="C10V33">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">But whosoever shall deny me before men, him will I also deny before my Father which is in heaven.
</span> <span class="verse"> 34</span><a name="C10V34">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Think not that I am come to send peace on earth: I came not to send peace, but a sword.
</span> <span class="verse"> 35</span><a name="C10V35">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">For I am come to set a man at variance against his father, and the daughter against her mother, and the
daughter in law against her mother in law.
</span> <span class="verse"> 36</span><a name="C10V36">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And a man’s foes
shall be they of his own household.
</span> <span class="verse"> 37</span><a name="C10V37">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">He that loveth father or mother more than me is not worthy of me: and he that loveth son or daughter
more than me is not worthy of me.
</span> <span class="verse"> 38</span><a name="C10V38">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And he that taketh not his cross, and followeth after me, is not worthy of me.
</span> <span class="verse"> 39</span><a name="C10V39">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">He that findeth his life shall lose it: and he that loseth his life for my sake shall find it.</span></div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 40</span><a name="C10V40">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">He that receiveth you receiveth me, and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me.
</span> <span class="verse"> 41</span><a name="C10V41">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">He that receiveth a prophet in the name of a prophet shall receive a prophet’s reward; and he that receiveth
a righteous man in the name of a righteous man shall receive a righteous man’s reward.
</span> <span class="verse"> 42</span><a name="C10V42">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And whosoever shall give to drink unto one of these little ones a cup of cold
water only in the name of a disciple, verily I say unto you, he shall in no wise lose his reward.</span></div>
