 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C2V1">&nbsp;</a>Therefore thou art inexcusable, O man, whosoever thou art that judgest: for wherein thou judgest another,
thou condemnest thyself; for thou that judgest doest the same things.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C2V2">&nbsp;</a>But we are sure that the judgment of God is according to truth against them which commit such things.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C2V3">&nbsp;</a>And thinkest thou this, O man, that judgest them which do such things, and doest the same, that thou
shalt escape the judgment of God?
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C2V4">&nbsp;</a>Or despisest thou the riches of his goodness and forbearance and longsuffering; not knowing that the
goodness of God leadeth thee to repentance?
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C2V5">&nbsp;</a>But after thy hardness and impenitent heart treasurest up unto thyself wrath against the day of wrath
and revelation of the righteous judgment of God;
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C2V6">&nbsp;</a>Who will render to every man according to his deeds:
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C2V7">&nbsp;</a>To them who by patient continuance in well doing seek for glory and honour and immortality, eternal life:
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C2V8">&nbsp;</a>But unto them that are contentious, and do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness, indignation
and wrath,
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C2V9">&nbsp;</a>Tribulation and anguish, upon every soul of man that doeth evil, of the Jew first, and also of the Gentile;
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C2V10">&nbsp;</a>But glory, honour, and peace, to every man that worketh good, to the Jew first, and also to the Gentile:
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C2V11">&nbsp;</a>For there is no respect of persons with God.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C2V12">&nbsp;</a>For as many as have sinned without law shall also perish without law: and as many as have sinned in the
law shall be judged by the law;
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C2V13">&nbsp;</a>(For not the hearers of the law
<span class="add">are</span> just before God, but the doers of the law shall be justified.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C2V14">&nbsp;</a>For when the Gentiles, which have not the law, do by nature the things contained in the law, these, having
not the law, are a law unto themselves:
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C2V15">&nbsp;</a>Which shew the work of the law written in their hearts, their conscience also bearing witness, and
<span class="add">their</span> thoughts the mean while accusing or else excusing one another;)
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C2V16">&nbsp;</a>In the day when God shall judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ according to my gospel.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C2V17">&nbsp;</a>Behold, thou art called a Jew, and restest in the law, and makest thy boast of God,
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C2V18">&nbsp;</a>And knowest
<span class="add">his</span> will, and approvest the things that are more excellent, being instructed out of the law;
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C2V19">&nbsp;</a>And art confident that thou thyself art a guide of the blind, a light of them which are in darkness,
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C2V20">&nbsp;</a>An instructor of the foolish, a teacher of babes, which hast the form of knowledge and of the truth in
the law.
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C2V21">&nbsp;</a>Thou therefore which teachest another, teachest thou not thyself? thou that preachest a man should not
steal, dost thou steal?
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C2V22">&nbsp;</a>Thou that sayest a man should not commit adultery, dost thou commit adultery? thou that abhorrest idols,
dost thou commit sacrilege?
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C2V23">&nbsp;</a>Thou that makest thy boast of the law, through breaking the law dishonourest thou God?
 <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C2V24">&nbsp;</a>For the name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles through you, as it is written.
 <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C2V25">&nbsp;</a>For circumcision verily profiteth, if thou keep the law: but if thou be a breaker of the law, thy circumcision
is made uncircumcision.
 <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C2V26">&nbsp;</a>Therefore if the uncircumcision keep the righteousness of the law, shall not his uncircumcision be counted
for circumcision?
 <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C2V27">&nbsp;</a>And shall not uncircumcision which is by nature, if it fulfil the law, judge thee, who by the letter
and circumcision dost transgress the law?
 <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C2V28">&nbsp;</a>For he is not a Jew, which is one outwardly; neither
<span class="add">is that</span> circumcision, which is outward in the flesh:
 <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C2V29">&nbsp;</a>But he
<span class="add">is</span> a Jew, which is one inwardly; and circumcision
<span class="add">is that</span> of the heart, in the spirit,
<span class="add">and</span> not in the letter; whose praise
<span class="add">is</span> not of men, but of God.
