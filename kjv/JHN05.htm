 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C5V1">&nbsp;</a>After this there was a feast of the Jews; and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C5V2">&nbsp;</a>Now there is at Jerusalem by the sheep
<span class="add">market</span> a pool, which is called in the Hebrew tongue Bethesda, having five porches.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C5V3">&nbsp;</a>In these lay a great multitude of impotent folk, of blind, halt, withered, waiting for the moving of
the water.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C5V4">&nbsp;</a>For an angel went down at a certain season into the pool, and troubled the water: whosoever then first
after the troubling of the water stepped in was made whole of whatsoever disease he had.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C5V5">&nbsp;</a>And a certain man was there, which had an infirmity thirty and eight years.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C5V6">&nbsp;</a>When Jesus saw him lie, and knew that he had been now a long time
<span class="add">in that case,</span> he saith unto him,
<span class="wj">Wilt thou be made whole?
</span> <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C5V7">&nbsp;</a>The impotent man answered him, Sir, I have no man, when the water is troubled, to put me into the pool:
but while I am coming, another steppeth down before me.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C5V8">&nbsp;</a>Jesus saith unto him,
<span class="wj">Rise, take up thy bed, and walk.
</span> <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C5V9">&nbsp;</a>And immediately the man was made whole, and took up his bed, and walked: and on the same day was the
sabbath.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C5V10">&nbsp;</a>The Jews therefore said unto him that was cured, It is the sabbath day: it is not lawful for thee to
carry
<span class="add">thy</span> bed.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C5V11">&nbsp;</a>He answered them, He that made me whole, the same said unto me,
<span class="wj">Take up thy bed, and walk.
</span> <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C5V12">&nbsp;</a>Then asked they him, What man is that which said unto thee,
<span class="wj">Take up thy bed, and walk?
</span> <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C5V13">&nbsp;</a>And he that was healed wist not who it was: for Jesus had conveyed himself away, a multitude being in
<span class="add">that</span> place.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C5V14">&nbsp;</a>Afterward Jesus findeth him in the temple, and said unto him,
<span class="wj">Behold, thou art made whole: sin no more, lest a worse thing come unto thee.
</span> <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C5V15">&nbsp;</a>The man departed, and told the Jews that it was Jesus, which had made him whole.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C5V16">&nbsp;</a>And therefore did the Jews persecute Jesus, and sought to slay him, because he had done these things
on the sabbath day.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C5V17">&nbsp;</a>But Jesus answered them,
<span class="wj">My Father worketh hitherto, and I work.
</span> <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C5V18">&nbsp;</a>Therefore the Jews sought the more to kill him, because he not only had broken the sabbath, but said
also that God was his Father, making himself equal with God.
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C5V19">&nbsp;</a>Then answered Jesus and said unto them,
<span class="wj">Verily, verily, I say unto you, The Son can do nothing of himself, but what he seeth the Father do: for
what things soever he doeth, these also doeth the Son likewise.
</span> <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C5V20">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">For the Father loveth the Son, and sheweth him all things that himself doeth: and he will shew him greater
works than these, that ye may marvel.
</span> <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C5V21">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">For as the Father raiseth up the dead, and quickeneth
</span><span class="add">them;
</span><span class="wj"> even so the Son quickeneth whom he will.
</span> <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C5V22">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">For the Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment unto the Son:
</span> <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C5V23">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">That all
</span><span class="add">men</span><span class="wj"> should honour the Son, even as they honour the Father. He that honoureth not the Son honoureth not the
Father which hath sent him.
</span> <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C5V24">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that heareth my word, and believeth on him that sent me, hath everlasting
life, and shall not come into condemnation; but is passed from death unto life.
</span> <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C5V25">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Verily, verily, I say unto you, The hour is coming, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of
the Son of God: and they that hear shall live.
</span> <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C5V26">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">For as the Father hath life in himself; so hath he given to the Son to have life in himself;
</span> <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C5V27">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And hath given him authority to execute judgment also, because he is the Son of man.
</span> <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C5V28">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Marvel not at this: for the hour is coming, in the which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice,
</span> <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C5V29">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And shall come forth; they that have done good, unto the resurrection of life; and they that have done
evil, unto the resurrection of damnation.
</span> <span class="verse"> 30</span><a name="C5V30">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">I can of mine own self do nothing: as I hear, I judge: and my judgment is just; because I seek not mine
own will, but the will of the Father which hath sent me.
</span> <span class="verse"> 31</span><a name="C5V31">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">If I bear witness of myself, my witness is not true.</span></div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 32</span><a name="C5V32">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">There is another that beareth witness of me; and I know that the witness which he witnesseth of me is
true.
</span> <span class="verse"> 33</span><a name="C5V33">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Ye sent unto John, and he bare witness unto the truth.
</span> <span class="verse"> 34</span><a name="C5V34">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">But I receive not testimony from man: but these things I say, that ye might be saved.
</span> <span class="verse"> 35</span><a name="C5V35">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">He was a burning and a shining light: and ye were willing for a season to rejoice in his light.</span></div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 36</span><a name="C5V36">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">But I have greater witness than
</span><span class="add">that</span><span class="wj"> of John: for the works which the Father hath given me to finish, the same works that I do, bear witness
of me, that the Father hath sent me.
</span> <span class="verse"> 37</span><a name="C5V37">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And the Father himself, which hath sent me, hath borne witness of me. Ye have neither heard his voice
at any time, nor seen his shape.
</span> <span class="verse"> 38</span><a name="C5V38">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And ye have not his word abiding in you: for whom he hath sent, him ye believe not.</span></div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 39</span><a name="C5V39">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Search the scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life: and they are they which testify of
me.
</span> <span class="verse"> 40</span><a name="C5V40">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And ye will not come to me, that ye might have life.
</span> <span class="verse"> 41</span><a name="C5V41">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">I receive not honour from men.
</span> <span class="verse"> 42</span><a name="C5V42">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">But I know you, that ye have not the love of God in you.
</span> <span class="verse"> 43</span><a name="C5V43">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">I am come in my Father’s name, and ye receive me not: if another shall come in his own name, him ye will
receive.
</span> <span class="verse"> 44</span><a name="C5V44">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">How can ye believe, which receive honour one of another, and seek not the honour that
</span><span class="add">cometh</span><span class="wj"> from God only?
</span> <span class="verse"> 45</span><a name="C5V45">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Do not think that I will accuse you to the Father: there is
</span><span class="add">one</span><span class="wj"> that accuseth you,
</span><span class="add">even</span><span class="wj"> Moses, in whom ye trust.
</span> <span class="verse"> 46</span><a name="C5V46">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">For had ye believed Moses, ye would have believed me: for he wrote of me.
</span> <span class="verse"> 47</span><a name="C5V47">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">But if ye believe not his writings, how shall ye believe my words?
