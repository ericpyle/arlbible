 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C3V1">&nbsp;</a>Finally, my brethren, rejoice in the Lord. To write the same things to you, to me indeed
<span class="add">is</span> not grievous, but for you
<span class="add">it is</span> safe.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C3V2">&nbsp;</a>Beware of dogs, beware of evil workers, beware of the concision.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C3V3">&nbsp;</a>For we are the circumcision, which worship God in the spirit, and rejoice in Christ Jesus, and have no
confidence in the flesh.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C3V4">&nbsp;</a>Though I might also have confidence in the flesh. If any other man thinketh that he hath whereof he might
trust in the flesh, I more:
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C3V5">&nbsp;</a>Circumcised the eighth day, of the stock of Israel,
<span class="add">of</span> the tribe of Benjamin, an Hebrew of the Hebrews; as touching the law, a Pharisee;
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C3V6">&nbsp;</a>Concerning zeal, persecuting the church; touching the righteousness which is in the law, blameless.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C3V7">&nbsp;</a>But what things were gain to me, those I counted loss for Christ.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C3V8">&nbsp;</a>Yea doubtless, and I count all things
<span class="add">but</span> loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord: for whom I have suffered the loss
of all things, and do count them
<span class="add">but</span> dung, that I may win Christ,
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C3V9">&nbsp;</a>And be found in him, not having mine own righteousness, which is of the law, but that which is through
the faith of Christ, the righteousness which is of God by faith:
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C3V10">&nbsp;</a>That I may know him, and the power of his resurrection, and the fellowship of his sufferings, being made
conformable unto his death;
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C3V11">&nbsp;</a>If by any means I might attain unto the resurrection of the dead.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C3V12">&nbsp;</a>Not as though I had already attained, either were already perfect: but I follow after, if that I may
apprehend that for which also I am apprehended of Christ Jesus.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C3V13">&nbsp;</a>Brethren, I count not myself to have apprehended: but
<span class="add">this</span> one thing
<span class="add">I do,</span> forgetting those things which are behind, and reaching forth unto those things which are before,
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C3V14">&nbsp;</a>I press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C3V15">&nbsp;</a>Let us therefore, as many as be perfect, be thus minded: and if in any thing ye be otherwise minded,
God shall reveal even this unto you.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C3V16">&nbsp;</a>Nevertheless, whereto we have already attained, let us walk by the same rule, let us mind the same thing.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C3V17">&nbsp;</a>Brethren, be followers together of me, and mark them which walk so as ye have us for an ensample.
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C3V18">&nbsp;</a>(For many walk, of whom I have told you often, and now tell you even weeping,
<span class="add">that they are</span> the enemies of the cross of Christ:
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C3V19">&nbsp;</a>Whose end
<span class="add">is</span> destruction, whose God
<span class="add">is their</span> belly, and
<span class="add">whose</span> glory
<span class="add">is</span> in their shame, who mind earthly things.)
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C3V20">&nbsp;</a>For our conversation is in heaven; from whence also we look for the Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ:
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C3V21">&nbsp;</a>Who shall change our vile body, that it may be fashioned like unto his glorious body, according to the
working whereby he is able even to subdue all things unto himself.
