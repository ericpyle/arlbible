 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C11V1">&nbsp;</a>And the whole earth was of one language, and of one speech.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C11V2">&nbsp;</a>And it came to pass, as they journeyed from the east, that they found a plain in the land of Shinar;
and they dwelt there.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C11V3">&nbsp;</a>And they said one to another, Go to, let us make brick, and burn them throughly. And they had brick for
stone, and slime had they for morter.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C11V4">&nbsp;</a>And they said, Go to, let us build us a city and a tower, whose top
<span class="add">may reach</span> unto heaven; and let us make us a name, lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C11V5">&nbsp;</a>And the LORD came down to see the city and the tower, which the children of men builded.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C11V6">&nbsp;</a>And the LORD said, Behold, the people
<span class="add">is</span> one, and they have all one language; and this they begin to do: and now nothing will be restrained from
them, which they have imagined to do.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C11V7">&nbsp;</a>Go to, let us go down, and there confound their language, that they may not understand one another’s
speech.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C11V8">&nbsp;</a>So the LORD scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of all the earth: and they left off to build
the city.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C11V9">&nbsp;</a>Therefore is the name of it called Babel; because the LORD did there confound the language of all the
earth: and from thence did the LORD scatter them abroad upon the face of all the earth.
