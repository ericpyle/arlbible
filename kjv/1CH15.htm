 <span class="verse" id="V1">1&nbsp;</span>And <span class='add'>David</span> made him houses in the city of David, and prepared a place for the ark of God, and pitched for it a tent.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span>Then David said, None ought to carry the ark of God but the Levites: for them hath the LORD chosen to carry the ark of God, and to minister unto him for ever.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>And David gathered all Israel together to Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of the LORD unto his place, which he had prepared for it.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>And David assembled the children of Aaron, and the Levites:  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>Of the sons of Kohath; Uriel the chief, and his brethren an hundred and twenty:  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>Of the sons of Merari; Asaiah the chief, and his brethren two hundred and twenty:  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>Of the sons of Gershom; Joel the chief, and his brethren an hundred and thirty:  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>Of the sons of Elizaphan; Shemaiah the chief, and his brethren two hundred:  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>Of the sons of Hebron; Eliel the chief, and his brethren fourscore:  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>Of the sons of Uzziel; Amminadab the chief, and his brethren an hundred and twelve.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>And David called for Zadok and Abiathar the priests, and for the Levites, for Uriel, Asaiah, and Joel, Shemaiah, and Eliel, and Amminadab,  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>And said unto them, Ye <span class='add'>are</span> the chief of the fathers of the Levites: sanctify yourselves, <span class='add'>both</span> ye and your brethren, that ye may bring up the ark of the LORD God of Israel unto <span class='add'>the place that</span> I have prepared for it.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>For because ye <span class='add'>did it</span> not at the first, the LORD our God made a breach upon us, for that we sought him not after the due order.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>So the priests and the Levites sanctified themselves to bring up the ark of the LORD God of Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>And the children of the Levites bare the ark of God upon their shoulders with the staves thereon, as Moses commanded according to the word of the LORD.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>And David spake to the chief of the Levites to appoint their brethren <span class='add'>to be</span> the singers with instruments of musick, psalteries and harps and cymbals, sounding, by lifting up the voice with joy.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>So the Levites appointed Heman the son of Joel; and of his brethren, Asaph the son of Berechiah; and of the sons of Merari their brethren, Ethan the son of Kushaiah;  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>And with them their brethren of the second <span class='add'>degree</span>, Zechariah, Ben, and Jaaziel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Unni, Eliab, and Benaiah, and Maaseiah, and Mattithiah, and Elipheleh, and Mikneiah, and Obed-edom, and Jeiel, the porters.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>So the singers, Heman, Asaph, and Ethan, <span class='add'>were appointed</span> to sound with cymbals of brass;  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>And Zechariah, and Aziel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Unni, and Eliab, and Maaseiah, and Benaiah, with psalteries on Alamoth;  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>And Mattithiah, and Elipheleh, and Mikneiah, and Obed-edom, and Jeiel, and Azaziah, with harps on the Sheminith to excel.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>And Chenaniah, chief of the Levites, <span class='add'>was</span> for song: he instructed about the song, because he <span class='add'>was</span> skilful.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>And Berechiah and Elkanah <span class='add'>were</span> doorkeepers for the ark.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>And Shebaniah, and Jehoshaphat, and Nethaneel, and Amasai, and Zechariah, and Benaiah, and Eliezer, the priests, did blow with the trumpets before the ark of God: and Obed-edom and Jehiah <span class='add'>were</span> doorkeepers for the ark. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>So David, and the elders of Israel, and the captains over thousands, went to bring up the ark of the covenant of the LORD out of the house of Obed-edom with joy.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>And it came to pass, when God helped the Levites that bare the ark of the covenant of the LORD, that they offered seven bullocks and seven rams.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>And David <span class='add'>was</span> clothed with a robe of fine linen, and all the Levites that bare the ark, and the singers, and Chenaniah the master of the song with the singers: David also <span class='add'>had</span> upon him an ephod of linen.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&nbsp;</span>Thus all Israel brought up the ark of the covenant of the LORD with shouting, and with sound of the cornet, and with trumpets, and with cymbals, making a noise with psalteries and harps. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V29">29&nbsp;</span>And it came to pass, <span class='add'>as</span> the ark of the covenant of the LORD came to the city of David, that Michal the daughter of Saul looking out at a window saw king David dancing and playing: and she despised him in her heart. </div><ul class='tnav'>
