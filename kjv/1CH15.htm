 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C15V1">&nbsp;</a>And
<span class="add">David</span> made him houses in the city of David, and prepared a place for the ark of God, and pitched for it a
tent.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C15V2">&nbsp;</a>Then David said, None ought to carry the ark of God but the Levites: for them hath the LORD chosen to
carry the ark of God, and to minister unto him for ever.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C15V3">&nbsp;</a>And David gathered all Israel together to Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of the LORD unto his place,
which he had prepared for it.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C15V4">&nbsp;</a>And David assembled the children of Aaron, and the Levites:
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C15V5">&nbsp;</a>Of the sons of Kohath; Uriel the chief, and his brethren an hundred and twenty:
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C15V6">&nbsp;</a>Of the sons of Merari; Asaiah the chief, and his brethren two hundred and twenty:
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C15V7">&nbsp;</a>Of the sons of Gershom; Joel the chief, and his brethren an hundred and thirty:
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C15V8">&nbsp;</a>Of the sons of Elizaphan; Shemaiah the chief, and his brethren two hundred:
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C15V9">&nbsp;</a>Of the sons of Hebron; Eliel the chief, and his brethren fourscore:
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C15V10">&nbsp;</a>Of the sons of Uzziel; Amminadab the chief, and his brethren an hundred and twelve.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C15V11">&nbsp;</a>And David called for Zadok and Abiathar the priests, and for the Levites, for Uriel, Asaiah, and Joel,
Shemaiah, and Eliel, and Amminadab,
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C15V12">&nbsp;</a>And said unto them, Ye
<span class="add">are</span> the chief of the fathers of the Levites: sanctify yourselves,
<span class="add">both</span> ye and your brethren, that ye may bring up the ark of the LORD God of Israel unto
<span class="add">the place that</span> I have prepared for it.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C15V13">&nbsp;</a>For because ye
<span class="add">did it</span> not at the first, the LORD our God made a breach upon us, for that we sought him not after the due order.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C15V14">&nbsp;</a>So the priests and the Levites sanctified themselves to bring up the ark of the LORD God of Israel.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C15V15">&nbsp;</a>And the children of the Levites bare the ark of God upon their shoulders with the staves thereon, as
Moses commanded according to the word of the LORD.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C15V16">&nbsp;</a>And David spake to the chief of the Levites to appoint their brethren
<span class="add">to be</span> the singers with instruments of musick, psalteries and harps and cymbals, sounding, by lifting up the
voice with joy.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C15V17">&nbsp;</a>So the Levites appointed Heman the son of Joel; and of his brethren, Asaph the son of Berechiah; and
of the sons of Merari their brethren, Ethan the son of Kushaiah;
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C15V18">&nbsp;</a>And with them their brethren of the second
<span class="add">degree,</span> Zechariah, Ben, and Jaaziel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Unni, Eliab, and Benaiah, and Maaseiah,
and Mattithiah, and Elipheleh, and Mikneiah, and Obed-edom, and Jeiel, the porters.
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C15V19">&nbsp;</a>So the singers, Heman, Asaph, and Ethan,
<span class="add">were appointed</span> to sound with cymbals of brass;
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C15V20">&nbsp;</a>And Zechariah, and Aziel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Unni, and Eliab, and Maaseiah, and Benaiah,
with psalteries on Alamoth;
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C15V21">&nbsp;</a>And Mattithiah, and Elipheleh, and Mikneiah, and Obed-edom, and Jeiel, and Azaziah, with harps on the
Sheminith to excel.
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C15V22">&nbsp;</a>And Chenaniah, chief of the Levites,
<span class="add">was</span> for song: he instructed about the song, because he
<span class="add">was</span> skilful.
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C15V23">&nbsp;</a>And Berechiah and Elkanah
<span class="add">were</span> doorkeepers for the ark.
 <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C15V24">&nbsp;</a>And Shebaniah, and Jehoshaphat, and Nethaneel, and Amasai, and Zechariah, and Benaiah, and Eliezer, the
priests, did blow with the trumpets before the ark of God: and Obed-edom and Jehiah
<span class="add">were</span> doorkeepers for the ark.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C15V25">&nbsp;</a>So David, and the elders of Israel, and the captains over thousands, went to bring up the ark of the
covenant of the LORD out of the house of Obed-edom with joy.
 <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C15V26">&nbsp;</a>And it came to pass, when God helped the Levites that bare the ark of the covenant of the LORD, that
they offered seven bullocks and seven rams.
 <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C15V27">&nbsp;</a>And David
<span class="add">was</span> clothed with a robe of fine linen, and all the Levites that bare the ark, and the singers, and Chenaniah
the master of the song with the singers: David also
<span class="add">had</span> upon him an ephod of linen.
 <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C15V28">&nbsp;</a>Thus all Israel brought up the ark of the covenant of the LORD with shouting, and with sound of the cornet,
and with trumpets, and with cymbals, making a noise with psalteries and harps.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C15V29">&nbsp;</a>And it came to pass,
<span class="add">as</span> the ark of the covenant of the LORD came to the city of David, that Michal the daughter of Saul looking
out at a window saw king David dancing and playing: and she despised him in her heart.
