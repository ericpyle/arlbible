<div class="mt1">The Second Epistle General of Peter
</div>
<div class="chapterlabel"> 1</div><div class="p">
 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C1V1">&nbsp;</a>Simon Peter, a servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ, to them that have obtained like precious faith
with us through the righteousness of God and our Saviour Jesus Christ:
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C1V2">&nbsp;</a>Grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God, and of Jesus our Lord,
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C1V3">&nbsp;</a>According as his divine power hath given unto us all things that
<span class="add">pertain</span> unto life and godliness, through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue:
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C1V4">&nbsp;</a>Whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises: that by these ye might be partakers
of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C1V5">&nbsp;</a>And beside this, giving all diligence, add to your faith virtue; and to virtue knowledge;
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C1V6">&nbsp;</a>And to knowledge temperance; and to temperance patience; and to patience godliness;
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C1V7">&nbsp;</a>And to godliness brotherly kindness; and to brotherly kindness charity.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C1V8">&nbsp;</a>For if these things be in you, and abound, they make
<span class="add">you that ye shall</span> neither
<span class="add">be</span> barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C1V9">&nbsp;</a>But he that lacketh these things is blind, and cannot see afar off, and hath forgotten that he was purged
from his old sins.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C1V10">&nbsp;</a>Wherefore the rather, brethren, give diligence to make your calling and election sure: for if ye do these
things, ye shall never fall:
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C1V11">&nbsp;</a>For so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and
Saviour Jesus Christ.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C1V12">&nbsp;</a>Wherefore I will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of these things, though ye know
<span class="add">them,</span> and be established in the present truth.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C1V13">&nbsp;</a>Yea, I think it meet, as long as I am in this tabernacle, to stir you up by putting
<span class="add">you</span> in remembrance;
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C1V14">&nbsp;</a>Knowing that shortly I must put off
<span class="add">this</span> my tabernacle, even as our Lord Jesus Christ hath shewed me.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C1V15">&nbsp;</a>Moreover I will endeavour that ye may be able after my decease to have these things always in remembrance.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C1V16">&nbsp;</a>For we have not followed cunningly devised fables, when we made known unto you the power and coming of
our Lord Jesus Christ, but were eyewitnesses of his majesty.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C1V17">&nbsp;</a>For he received from God the Father honour and glory, when there came such a voice to him from the excellent
glory, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C1V18">&nbsp;</a>And this voice which came from heaven we heard, when we were with him in the holy mount.
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C1V19">&nbsp;</a>We have also a more sure word of prophecy; whereunto ye do well that ye take heed, as unto a light that
shineth in a dark place, until the day dawn, and the day star arise in your hearts:
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C1V20">&nbsp;</a>Knowing this first, that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation.
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C1V21">&nbsp;</a>For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but holy men of God spake
<span class="add">as they were</span> moved by the Holy Ghost.
