<div class="chapterlabel"> 26</div><div class="p">
 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C26V1">&nbsp;</a>And it came to pass, when Jesus had finished all these sayings, he said unto his disciples,
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C26V2">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Ye know that after two days is
the feast of the passover, and the Son of man is betrayed to be crucified.
</span> <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C26V3">&nbsp;</a>Then assembled together the chief priests, and the scribes, and the elders of the people, unto the palace
of the high priest, who was called Caiaphas,
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C26V4">&nbsp;</a>And consulted that they might take Jesus by subtilty, and kill
<span class="add">him.
</span> <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C26V5">&nbsp;</a>But they said, Not on the feast
<span class="add">day,</span> lest there be an uproar among the people.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C26V6">&nbsp;</a>Now when Jesus was in Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper,
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C26V7">&nbsp;</a>There came unto him a woman having an alabaster box of very precious ointment, and poured it on his head,
as he sat
<span class="add">at meat.
</span> <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C26V8">&nbsp;</a>But when his disciples saw
<span class="add">it,</span> they had indignation, saying, To what purpose
<span class="add">is</span> this waste?
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C26V9">&nbsp;</a>For this ointment might have been sold for much, and given to the poor.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C26V10">&nbsp;</a>When Jesus understood
<span class="add">it,</span> he said unto them,
<span class="wj">Why trouble ye the woman? for she hath wrought a good work upon me.
</span> <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C26V11">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">For ye have the poor always with you; but me ye have not always.
</span> <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C26V12">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">For in that she hath poured this ointment on my body, she did
it for my burial.
</span> <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C26V13">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Verily I say unto you, Wheresoever this gospel shall be preached in the whole world,
there shall also this, that this woman hath done, be told for a memorial of her.</span></div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C26V14">&nbsp;</a>Then one of the twelve, called Judas Iscariot, went unto the chief priests,
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C26V15">&nbsp;</a>And said
<span class="add">unto them,</span> What will ye give me, and I will deliver him unto you? And they covenanted with him for thirty pieces
of silver.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C26V16">&nbsp;</a>And from that time he sought opportunity to betray him.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C26V17">&nbsp;</a>Now the first
<span class="add">day</span> of the
<span class="add">feast of</span> unleavened bread the disciples came to Jesus, saying unto him, Where wilt thou that we prepare for thee
to eat the passover?
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C26V18">&nbsp;</a>And he said,
<span class="wj">Go into the city to such a man, and say unto him, The Master saith, My time is at hand; I will keep the
passover at thy house with my disciples.
</span> <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C26V19">&nbsp;</a>And the disciples did as Jesus had appointed them; and they made ready the passover.
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C26V20">&nbsp;</a>Now when the even was come, he sat down with the twelve.
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C26V21">&nbsp;</a>And as they did eat, he said,
<span class="wj">Verily I say unto you, that one of you shall betray me.
</span> <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C26V22">&nbsp;</a>And they were exceeding sorrowful, and began every one of them to say unto him, Lord, is it I?
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C26V23">&nbsp;</a>And he answered and said,
<span class="wj">He that dippeth
his hand with me in the dish, the same shall betray me.
</span> <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C26V24">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">The Son of man goeth as it is written of him: but woe unto that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed!
it had been good for that man if he had not been born.
</span> <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C26V25">&nbsp;</a>Then Judas, which betrayed him, answered and said, Master, is it I? He said unto him,
<span class="wj">Thou hast said.</span></div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C26V26">&nbsp;</a>And as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and blessed
<span class="add">it,</span> and brake
<span class="add">it,</span> and gave
<span class="add">it</span> to the disciples, and said,
<span class="wj">Take, eat; this is my body.
</span> <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C26V27">&nbsp;</a>And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and gave
<span class="add">it</span> to them, saying,
<span class="wj">Drink ye all of it;
</span> <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C26V28">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">For this is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for many for the remission of sins.
</span> <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C26V29">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">But I say unto you, I will not drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine, until that day when I drink
it new with you in my Father’s kingdom.
</span> <span class="verse"> 30</span><a name="C26V30">&nbsp;</a>And when they had sung an hymn, they went out into the mount of Olives.
 <span class="verse"> 31</span><a name="C26V31">&nbsp;</a>Then saith Jesus unto them,
<span class="wj">All ye shall be offended because of me this night: for it is written, I will smite the shepherd, and
the sheep of the flock shall be scattered abroad.
</span> <span class="verse"> 32</span><a name="C26V32">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">But after I am risen again, I will go before you into Galilee.
</span> <span class="verse"> 33</span><a name="C26V33">&nbsp;</a>Peter answered and said unto him, Though all
<span class="add">men</span> shall be offended because of thee,
<span class="add">yet</span> will I never be offended.
 <span class="verse"> 34</span><a name="C26V34">&nbsp;</a>Jesus said unto him,
<span class="wj">Verily I say unto thee, That this night, before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice.
</span> <span class="verse"> 35</span><a name="C26V35">&nbsp;</a>Peter said unto him, Though I should die with thee, yet will I not deny thee. Likewise also said all
the disciples.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 36</span><a name="C26V36">&nbsp;</a>Then cometh Jesus with them unto a place called Gethsemane, and saith unto the disciples,
<span class="wj">Sit ye here, while I go and pray yonder.
</span> <span class="verse"> 37</span><a name="C26V37">&nbsp;</a>And he took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, and began to be sorrowful and very heavy.
 <span class="verse"> 38</span><a name="C26V38">&nbsp;</a>Then saith he unto them,
<span class="wj">My soul is exceeding sorrowful, even unto death: tarry ye here, and watch with me.
</span> <span class="verse"> 39</span><a name="C26V39">&nbsp;</a>And he went a little farther, and fell on his face, and prayed, saying,
<span class="wj">O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me: nevertheless not as I will, but as thou
wilt.
</span> <span class="verse"> 40</span><a name="C26V40">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And he cometh unto the disciples, and findeth them asleep, and saith unto Peter, What, could ye not watch
with me one hour?
</span> <span class="verse"> 41</span><a name="C26V41">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation: the spirit indeed
is willing, but the flesh
is weak.
</span> <span class="verse"> 42</span><a name="C26V42">&nbsp;</a>He went away again the second time, and prayed, saying,
<span class="wj">O my Father, if this cup may not pass away from me, except I drink it, thy will be done.
</span> <span class="verse"> 43</span><a name="C26V43">&nbsp;</a>And he came and found them asleep again: for their eyes were heavy.
 <span class="verse"> 44</span><a name="C26V44">&nbsp;</a>And he left them, and went away again, and prayed the third time, saying the same words.
 <span class="verse"> 45</span><a name="C26V45">&nbsp;</a>Then cometh he to his disciples, and saith unto them,
<span class="wj">Sleep on now, and take
your rest: behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.
</span> <span class="verse"> 46</span><a name="C26V46">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Rise, let us be going: behold, he is at hand that doth betray me.
</span></div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 47</span><a name="C26V47">&nbsp;</a>And while he yet spake, lo, Judas, one of the twelve, came, and with him a great multitude with swords
and staves, from the chief priests and elders of the people.
 <span class="verse"> 48</span><a name="C26V48">&nbsp;</a>Now he that betrayed him gave them a sign, saying, Whomsoever I shall kiss, that same is he: hold him
fast.
 <span class="verse"> 49</span><a name="C26V49">&nbsp;</a>And forthwith he came to Jesus, and said, Hail, master; and kissed him.
 <span class="verse"> 50</span><a name="C26V50">&nbsp;</a>And Jesus said unto him,
<span class="wj">Friend, wherefore art thou come?</span> Then came they, and laid hands on Jesus, and took him.
 <span class="verse"> 51</span><a name="C26V51">&nbsp;</a>And, behold, one of them which were with Jesus stretched out
<span class="add">his</span> hand, and drew his sword, and struck a servant of the high priest’s, and smote off his ear.
 <span class="verse"> 52</span><a name="C26V52">&nbsp;</a>Then said Jesus unto him,
<span class="wj">Put up again thy sword into his place: for all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword.
</span> <span class="verse"> 53</span><a name="C26V53">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Thinkest thou that I cannot now pray to my Father, and he shall presently give me more than twelve legions
of angels?
</span> <span class="verse"> 54</span><a name="C26V54">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">But how then shall the scriptures be fulfilled, that thus it must be?
</span> <span class="verse"> 55</span><a name="C26V55">&nbsp;</a>In that same hour said Jesus to the multitudes,
<span class="wj">Are ye come out as against a thief with swords and staves for to take me? I sat daily with you teaching
in the temple, and ye laid no hold on me.
</span> <span class="verse"> 56</span><a name="C26V56">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">But all this was done, that the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled.
</span>Then all the disciples forsook him, and fled.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 57</span><a name="C26V57">&nbsp;</a>And they that had laid hold on Jesus led
<span class="add">him</span> away to Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders were assembled.
 <span class="verse"> 58</span><a name="C26V58">&nbsp;</a>But Peter followed him afar off unto the high priest’s palace, and went in, and sat with the servants,
to see the end.
 <span class="verse"> 59</span><a name="C26V59">&nbsp;</a>Now the chief priests, and elders, and all the council, sought false witness against Jesus, to put him
to death;
 <span class="verse"> 60</span><a name="C26V60">&nbsp;</a>But found none: yea, though many false witnesses came,
<span class="add">yet</span> found they none. At the last came two false witnesses,
 <span class="verse"> 61</span><a name="C26V61">&nbsp;</a>And said, This
<span class="add">fellow</span> said, I am able to destroy the temple of God, and to build it in three days.
 <span class="verse"> 62</span><a name="C26V62">&nbsp;</a>And the high priest arose, and said unto him, Answerest thou nothing? what
<span class="add">is it which</span> these witness against thee?
 <span class="verse"> 63</span><a name="C26V63">&nbsp;</a>But Jesus held his peace. And the high priest answered and said unto him, I adjure thee by the living
God, that thou tell us whether thou be the Christ, the Son of God.
 <span class="verse"> 64</span><a name="C26V64">&nbsp;</a>Jesus saith unto him,
<span class="wj">Thou hast said: nevertheless I say unto you, Hereafter shall ye see the Son of man sitting on the right
hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven.
</span> <span class="verse"> 65</span><a name="C26V65">&nbsp;</a>Then the high priest rent his clothes, saying, He hath spoken blasphemy; what further need have we of
witnesses? behold, now ye have heard his blasphemy.
 <span class="verse"> 66</span><a name="C26V66">&nbsp;</a>What think ye? They answered and said, He is guilty of death.
 <span class="verse"> 67</span><a name="C26V67">&nbsp;</a>Then did they spit in his face, and buffeted him; and others smote
<span class="add">him</span> with the palms of their hands,
 <span class="verse"> 68</span><a name="C26V68">&nbsp;</a>Saying, Prophesy unto us, thou Christ, Who is he that smote thee?
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 69</span><a name="C26V69">&nbsp;</a>Now Peter sat without in the palace: and a damsel came unto him, saying, Thou also wast with Jesus of
Galilee.
 <span class="verse"> 70</span><a name="C26V70">&nbsp;</a>But he denied before
<span class="add">them</span> all, saying, I know not what thou sayest.
 <span class="verse"> 71</span><a name="C26V71">&nbsp;</a>And when he was gone out into the porch, another
<span class="add">maid</span> saw him, and said unto them that were there, This
<span class="add">fellow</span> was also with Jesus of Nazareth.
 <span class="verse"> 72</span><a name="C26V72">&nbsp;</a>And again he denied with an oath, I do not know the man.
 <span class="verse"> 73</span><a name="C26V73">&nbsp;</a>And after a while came unto
<span class="add">him</span> they that stood by, and said to Peter, Surely thou also art
<span class="add">one</span> of them; for thy speech bewrayeth thee.
 <span class="verse"> 74</span><a name="C26V74">&nbsp;</a>Then began he to curse and to swear,
<span class="add">saying,</span> I know not the man. And immediately the cock crew.
 <span class="verse"> 75</span><a name="C26V75">&nbsp;</a>And Peter remembered the word of Jesus, which said unto him,
<span class="wj">Before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice.</span> And he went out, and wept bitterly.
