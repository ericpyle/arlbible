 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C21V1">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">After these things Jesus shewed himself again to the disciples at the sea of Tiberias; and on this wise
shewed he
</span><span class="add">himself.
</span> <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C21V2">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">There were together Simon Peter, and Thomas called Didymus, and Nathanael of Cana in Galilee, and the
</span><span class="add">sons</span><span class="wj"> of Zebedee, and two other of his disciples.
</span> <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C21V3">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Simon Peter saith unto them, I go a fishing. They say unto him, We also go with thee. They went forth,
and entered into a ship immediately; and that night they caught nothing.
</span> <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C21V4">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">But when the morning was now come, Jesus stood on the shore: but the disciples knew not that it was Jesus.
</span> <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C21V5">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Then Jesus saith unto them, Children, have ye any meat?</span> They answered him, No.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C21V6">&nbsp;</a>And he said unto them,
<span class="wj">Cast the net on the right side of the ship, and ye shall find.</span> They cast therefore, and now they were not able to draw it for the multitude of fishes.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C21V7">&nbsp;</a>Therefore that disciple whom Jesus loved saith unto Peter, It is the Lord. Now when Simon Peter heard
that it was the Lord, he girt
<span class="add">his
</span> fisher’s coat
<span class="add">unto him,</span> (for he was naked,) and did cast himself into the sea.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C21V8">&nbsp;</a>And the other disciples came in a little ship; (for they were not far from land, but as it were two hundred
cubits,) dragging the net with fishes.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C21V9">&nbsp;</a>As soon then as they were come to land, they saw a fire of coals there, and fish laid thereon, and bread.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C21V10">&nbsp;</a>Jesus saith unto them,
<span class="wj">Bring of the fish which ye have now caught.
</span> <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C21V11">&nbsp;</a>Simon Peter went up, and drew the net to land full of great fishes, and hundred and fifty and three:
and for all there were so many, yet was not the net broken.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C21V12">&nbsp;</a>Jesus saith unto them,
<span class="wj">Come
</span><span class="add">and</span><span class="wj"> dine.</span> And none of the disciples durst ask him, Who art thou? knowing that it was the Lord.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C21V13">&nbsp;</a>Jesus then cometh, and taketh bread, and giveth them, and fish likewise.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C21V14">&nbsp;</a>This is now the third time that Jesus shewed himself to his disciples, after that he was risen from the
dead.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C21V15">&nbsp;</a>So when they had dined, Jesus saith to Simon Peter,
<span class="wj">Simon,
</span><span class="add">son</span><span class="wj"> of Jonas, lovest thou me more than these?</span> He saith unto him, Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I love thee. He saith unto him,
<span class="wj">Feed my lambs.
</span> <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C21V16">&nbsp;</a>He saith to him again the second time,
<span class="wj">Simon,
</span><span class="add">son</span><span class="wj"> of Jonas, lovest thou me?</span> He saith unto him, Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I love thee. He saith unto him,
<span class="wj">Feed my sheep.
</span> <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C21V17">&nbsp;</a>He saith unto him the third time,
<span class="wj">Simon,
</span><span class="add">son</span><span class="wj"> of Jonas, lovest thou me?</span> Peter was grieved because he said unto him the third time, Lovest thou me? And he said unto him, Lord,
thou knowest all things; thou knowest that I love thee. Jesus saith unto him,
<span class="wj">Feed my sheep.
</span> <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C21V18">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Verily, verily, I say unto thee, When thou wast young, thou girdedst thyself, and walkedst whither thou
wouldest: but when thou shalt be old, thou shalt stretch forth thy hands, and another shall gird thee,
and carry
</span><span class="add">thee</span><span class="wj"> whither thou wouldest not.
</span> <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C21V19">&nbsp;</a>This spake he, signifying by what death he should glorify God. And when he had spoken this, he saith
unto him,
<span class="wj">Follow me.
</span> <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C21V20">&nbsp;</a>Then Peter, turning about, seeth the disciple whom Jesus loved following; which also leaned on his breast
at supper, and said, Lord, which is he that betrayeth thee?
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C21V21">&nbsp;</a>Peter seeing him saith to Jesus, Lord, and what
<span class="add">shall</span> this man
<span class="add">do?
</span> <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C21V22">&nbsp;</a>Jesus saith unto him,
<span class="wj">If I will that he tarry till I come, what
</span><span class="add">is that</span><span class="wj"> to thee? follow thou me.
</span> <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C21V23">&nbsp;</a>Then went this saying abroad among the brethren, that that disciple should not die: yet Jesus said not
unto him, He shall not die; but,
<span class="wj">If I will that he tarry till I come, what
</span><span class="add">is that</span><span class="wj"> to thee?
</span> <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C21V24">&nbsp;</a>This is the disciple which testifieth of these things, and wrote these things: and we know that his testimony
is true.
 <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C21V25">&nbsp;</a>And there are also many other things which Jesus did, the which, if they should be written every one,
I suppose that even the world itself could not contain the books that should be written. Amen.
