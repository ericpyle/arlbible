<div class="mt1">The First Book of Esdras
</div>
<div class="chapterlabel"> 1</div><div class="p">
 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C1V1">&nbsp;</a>And Josias held the feast of the passover in Jerusalem unto his Lord, and offered the passover the fourteenth
day of the first month;
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C1V2">&nbsp;</a>Having set the priests according to their daily courses, being arrayed in long garments, in the temple
of the Lord.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C1V3">&nbsp;</a>And he spake unto the Levites, the holy ministers of Israel, that they should hallow themselves unto
the Lord, to set the holy ark of the Lord in the house that king Solomon the son of David had built:
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C1V4">&nbsp;</a>And said, Ye shall no more bear the ark upon your shoulders: now therefore serve the Lord your God, and
minister unto his people Israel, and prepare you after your families and kindreds,
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C1V5">&nbsp;</a>According as David the king of Israel prescribed, and according to the magnificence of Solomon his son:
and standing in the temple according to the several dignity of the families of you the Levites, who minister
in the presence of your brethren the children of Israel,
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C1V6">&nbsp;</a>Offer the passover in order, and make ready the sacrifices for your brethren, and keep the passover according
to the commandment of the Lord, which was given unto Moses.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C1V7">&nbsp;</a>And unto the people that was found there Josias gave thirty thousand lambs and kids, and three thousand
calves: these things were given of the king’s allowance, according as he promised, to the people, to
the priests, and to the Levites.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C1V8">&nbsp;</a>And Helkias, Zacharias, and Syelus, the governors of the temple, gave to the priests for the passover
two thousand and six hundred sheep, and three hundred calves.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C1V9">&nbsp;</a>And Jeconias, and Samaias, and Nathanael his brother, and Assabias, and Ochiel, and Joram, captains over
thousands, gave to the Levites for the passover five thousand sheep, and seven hundred calves.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C1V10">&nbsp;</a>And when these things were done, the priests and Levites, having the unleavened bread, stood in very
comely order according to the kindreds,
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C1V11">&nbsp;</a>And according to the several dignities of the fathers, before the people, to offer to the Lord, as it
is written in the book of Moses: and thus did they in the morning.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C1V12">&nbsp;</a>And they roasted the passover with fire, as appertaineth: as for the sacrifices, they sod them in brass
pots and pans with a good savour,
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C1V13">&nbsp;</a>And set them before all the people: and afterward they prepared for themselves, and for the priests their
brethren, the sons of Aaron.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C1V14">&nbsp;</a>For the priests offered the fat until night: and the Levites prepared for themselves, and the priests
their brethren, the sons of Aaron.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C1V15">&nbsp;</a>The holy singers also, the sons of Asaph, were in their order, according to the appointment of David,
to wit, Asaph, Zacharias, and Jeduthun, who was of the king’s retinue.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C1V16">&nbsp;</a>Moreover the porters were at every gate; it was not lawful for any to go from his ordinary service: for
their brethren the Levites prepared for them.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C1V17">&nbsp;</a>Thus were the things that belonged to the sacrifices of the Lord accomplished in that day, that they
might hold the passover,
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C1V18">&nbsp;</a>And offer sacrifices upon the altar of the Lord, according to the commandment of king Josias.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C1V19">&nbsp;</a>So the children of Israel which were present held the passover at that time, and the feast of sweet bread
seven days.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C1V20">&nbsp;</a>And such a passover was not kept in Israel since the time of the prophet Samuel.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C1V21">&nbsp;</a>Yea, all the kings of Israel held not such a passover as Josias, and the priests, and the Levites, and
the Jews, held with all Israel that were found dwelling at Jerusalem.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C1V22">&nbsp;</a>In the eighteenth year of the reign of Josias was this passover kept.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C1V23">&nbsp;</a>And the works or Josias were upright before his Lord with an heart full of godliness.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C1V24">&nbsp;</a>As for the things that came to pass in his time, they were written in former times, concerning those
that sinned, and did wickedly against the Lord above all people and kingdoms, and how they grieved him
exceedingly, so that the words of the Lord rose up against Israel.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C1V25">&nbsp;</a>Now after all these acts of Josias it came to pass, that Pharaoh the king of Egypt came to raise war
at Carchamis upon Euphrates: and Josias went out against him.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C1V26">&nbsp;</a>But the king of Egypt sent to him, saying, What have I to do with thee, O king of Judea?
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C1V27">&nbsp;</a>I am not sent out from the Lord God against thee; for my war is upon Euphrates: and now the Lord is with
me, yea, the Lord is with me hasting me forward: depart from me, and be not against the Lord.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C1V28">&nbsp;</a>Howbeit Josias did not turn back his chariot from him, but undertook to fight with him, not regarding
the words of the prophet Jeremy spoken by the mouth of the Lord:
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C1V29">&nbsp;</a>But joined battle with him in the plain of Magiddo, and the princes came against king Josias.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 30</span><a name="C1V30">&nbsp;</a>Then said the king unto his servants, Carry me away out of the battle; for I am very weak. And immediately
his servants took him away out of the battle.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 31</span><a name="C1V31">&nbsp;</a>Then gat he up upon his second chariot; and being brought back to Jerusalem died, and was buried in his
father’s sepulchre.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 32</span><a name="C1V32">&nbsp;</a>And in all Jewry they mourned for Josias, yea, Jeremy the prophet lamented for Josias, and the chief
men with the women made lamentation for him unto this day: and this was given out for an ordinance to
be done continually in all the nation of Israel.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 33</span><a name="C1V33">&nbsp;</a>These things are written in the book of the stories of the kings of Judah, and every one of the acts
that Josias did, and his glory, and his understanding in the law of the Lord, and the things that he
had done before, and the things now recited, are reported in the book of the kings of Israel and Judea.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 34</span><a name="C1V34">&nbsp;</a>And the people took Joachaz the son of Josias, and made him king instead of Josias his father, when he
was twenty and three years old.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 35</span><a name="C1V35">&nbsp;</a>And he reigned in Judea and in Jerusalem three months: and then the king of Egypt deposed him from reigning
in Jerusalem.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 36</span><a name="C1V36">&nbsp;</a>And he set a tax upon the land of an hundred talents of silver and one talent of gold.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 37</span><a name="C1V37">&nbsp;</a>The king of Egypt also made king Joacim his brother king of Judea and Jerusalem.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 38</span><a name="C1V38">&nbsp;</a>And he bound Joacim and the nobles: but Zaraces his brother he apprehended, and brought him out of Egypt.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 39</span><a name="C1V39">&nbsp;</a>Five and twenty years old was Joacim when he was made king in the land of Judea and Jerusalem; and he
did evil before the Lord.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 40</span><a name="C1V40">&nbsp;</a>Wherefore against him Nabuchodonosor the king of Babylon came up, and bound him with a chain of brass,
and carried him into Babylon.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 41</span><a name="C1V41">&nbsp;</a>Nabuchodonosor also took of the holy vessels of the Lord, and carried them away, and set them in his
own temple at Babylon.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 42</span><a name="C1V42">&nbsp;</a>But those things that are recorded of him, and of his uncleaness and impiety, are written in the chronicles
of the kings.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 43</span><a name="C1V43">&nbsp;</a>And Joacim his son reigned in his stead: he was made king being eighteen years old;
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 44</span><a name="C1V44">&nbsp;</a>And reigned but three months and ten days in Jerusalem; and did evil before the Lord.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 45</span><a name="C1V45">&nbsp;</a>So after a year Nabuchodonosor sent and caused him to be brought into Babylon with the holy vessels of
the Lord;
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 46</span><a name="C1V46">&nbsp;</a>And made Zedechias king of Judea and Jerusalem, when he was one and twenty years old; and he reigned
eleven years:
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 47</span><a name="C1V47">&nbsp;</a>And he did evil also in the sight of the Lord, and cared not for the words that were spoken unto him
by the prophet Jeremy from the mouth of the Lord.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 48</span><a name="C1V48">&nbsp;</a>And after that king Nabuchodonosor had made him to swear by the name of the Lord, he forswore himself,
and rebelled; and hardening his neck, his heart, he transgressed the laws of the Lord God of Israel.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 49</span><a name="C1V49">&nbsp;</a>The governors also of the people and of the priests did many things against the laws, and passed all
the pollutions of all nations, and defiled the temple of the Lord, which was sanctified in Jerusalem.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 50</span><a name="C1V50">&nbsp;</a>Nevertheless the God of their fathers sent by his messenger to call them back, because he spared them
and his tabernacle also.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 51</span><a name="C1V51">&nbsp;</a>But they had his messengers in derision; and, look, when the Lord spake unto them, they made a sport
of his prophets:
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 52</span><a name="C1V52">&nbsp;</a>So far forth, that he, being wroth with his people for their great ungodliness, commanded the kings of
the Chaldees to come up against them;
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 53</span><a name="C1V53">&nbsp;</a>Who slew their young men with the sword, yea, even within the compass of their holy temple, and spared
neither young man nor maid, old man nor child, among them; for he delivered all into their hands.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 54</span><a name="C1V54">&nbsp;</a>And they took all the holy vessels of the Lord, both great and small, with the vessels of the ark of
God, and the king’s treasures, and carried them away into Babylon.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 55</span><a name="C1V55">&nbsp;</a>As for the house of the Lord, they burnt it, and brake down the walls of Jerusalem, and set fire upon
her towers:
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 56</span><a name="C1V56">&nbsp;</a>And as for her glorious things, they never ceased till they had consumed and brought them all to nought:
and the people that were not slain with the sword he carried unto Babylon:
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 57</span><a name="C1V57">&nbsp;</a>Who became servants to him and his children, till the Persians reigned, to fulfil the word of the Lord
spoken by the mouth of Jeremy:
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 58</span><a name="C1V58">&nbsp;</a>Until the land had enjoyed her sabbaths, the whole time of her desolation shall she rest, until the full
term of seventy years.
