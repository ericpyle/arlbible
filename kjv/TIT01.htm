<div class="mt1">The Epistle of Paul to Titus
</div>
<div class="chapterlabel"> 1</div><div class="p">
 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C1V1">&nbsp;</a>Paul, a servant of God, and an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the faith of God’s elect, and the
acknowledging of the truth which is after godliness;
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C1V2">&nbsp;</a>In hope of eternal life, which God, that cannot lie, promised before the world began;
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C1V3">&nbsp;</a>But hath in due times manifested his word through preaching, which is committed unto me according to
the commandment of God our Saviour;
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C1V4">&nbsp;</a>To Titus,
<span class="add">mine</span> own son after the common faith: Grace, mercy,
<span class="add">and</span> peace, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ our Saviour.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C1V5">&nbsp;</a>For this cause left I thee in Crete, that thou shouldest set in order the things that are wanting, and
ordain elders in every city, as I had appointed thee:
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C1V6">&nbsp;</a>If any be blameless, the husband of one wife, having faithful children not accused of riot or unruly.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C1V7">&nbsp;</a>For a bishop must be blameless, as the steward of God; not selfwilled, not soon angry, not given to wine,
no striker, not given to filthy lucre;
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C1V8">&nbsp;</a>But a lover of hospitality, a lover of good men, sober, just, holy, temperate;
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C1V9">&nbsp;</a>Holding fast the faithful word as he hath been taught, that he may be able by sound doctrine both to
exhort and to convince the gainsayers.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C1V10">&nbsp;</a>For there are many unruly and vain talkers and deceivers, specially they of the circumcision:
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C1V11">&nbsp;</a>Whose mouths must be stopped, who subvert whole houses, teaching things which they ought not, for filthy
lucre’s sake.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C1V12">&nbsp;</a>One of themselves,
<span class="add">even</span> a prophet of their own, said, The Cretians
<span class="add">are</span> alway liars, evil beasts, slow bellies.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C1V13">&nbsp;</a>This witness is true. Wherefore rebuke them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith;
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C1V14">&nbsp;</a>Not giving heed to Jewish fables, and commandments of men, that turn from the truth.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C1V15">&nbsp;</a>Unto the pure all things
<span class="add">are</span> pure: but unto them that are defiled and unbelieving
<span class="add">is</span> nothing pure; but even their mind and conscience is defiled.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C1V16">&nbsp;</a>They profess that they know God; but in works they deny
<span class="add">him,</span> being abominable, and disobedient, and unto every good work reprobate.
