 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C5V1">&nbsp;</a>Whosoever believeth that Jesus is the Christ is born of God: and every one that loveth him that begat
loveth him also that is begotten of him.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C5V2">&nbsp;</a>By this we know that we love the children of God, when we love God, and keep his commandments.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C5V3">&nbsp;</a>For this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments: and his commandments are not grievous.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C5V4">&nbsp;</a>For whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world: and this is the victory that overcometh the world,
<span class="add">even</span> our faith.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C5V5">&nbsp;</a>Who is he that overcometh the world, but he that believeth that Jesus is the Son of God?
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C5V6">&nbsp;</a>This is he that came by water and blood,
<span class="add">even</span> Jesus Christ; not by water only, but by water and blood. And it is the Spirit that beareth witness,
because the Spirit is truth.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C5V7">&nbsp;</a>For there are three that bear record in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost: and these three
are one.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C5V8">&nbsp;</a>And there are three that bear witness in earth, the spirit, and the water, and the blood: and these three
agree in one.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C5V9">&nbsp;</a>If we receive the witness of men, the witness of God is greater: for this is the witness of God which
he hath testified of his Son.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C5V10">&nbsp;</a>He that believeth on the Son of God hath the witness in himself: he that believeth not God hath made
him a liar; because he believeth not the record that God gave of his Son.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C5V11">&nbsp;</a>And this is the record, that God hath given to us eternal life, and this life is in his Son.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C5V12">&nbsp;</a>He that hath the Son hath life;
<span class="add">and</span> he that hath not the Son of God hath not life.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C5V13">&nbsp;</a>These things have I written unto you that believe on the name of the Son of God; that ye may know that
ye have eternal life, and that ye may believe on the name of the Son of God.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C5V14">&nbsp;</a>And this is the confidence that we have in him, that, if we ask any thing according to his will, he heareth
us:
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C5V15">&nbsp;</a>And if we know that he hear us, whatsoever we ask, we know that we have the petitions that we desired
of him.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C5V16">&nbsp;</a>If any man see his brother sin a sin
<span class="add">which is</span> not unto death, he shall ask, and he shall give him life for them that sin not unto death. There is
a sin unto death: I do not say that he shall pray for it.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C5V17">&nbsp;</a>All unrighteousness is sin: and there is a sin not unto death.
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C5V18">&nbsp;</a>We know that whosoever is born of God sinneth not; but he that is begotten of God keepeth himself, and
that wicked one toucheth him not.
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C5V19">&nbsp;</a>And we know that we are of God, and the whole world lieth in wickedness.
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C5V20">&nbsp;</a><span class="add">And</span> we know that the Son of God is come, and hath given us an understanding, that we may know him that is
true, and we are in him that is true,
<span class="add">even</span> in his Son Jesus Christ. This is the true God, and eternal life.
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C5V21">&nbsp;</a>Little children, keep yourselves from idols. Amen.
