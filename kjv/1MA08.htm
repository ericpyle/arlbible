<div class="chapterlabel"> 8</div><div class="p">
 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C8V1">&nbsp;</a>Now Judas had heard of the Romans, that they were mighty and valiant men, and such as would lovingly
accept all that joined themselves unto them, and make a league of amity with all that came unto them;
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C8V2">&nbsp;</a>And that they were men of great valour. It was told him also of their wars and noble acts which they
had done among the Galatians, and how they had conquered them, and brought them under tribute;
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C8V3">&nbsp;</a>And what they had done in the country of Spain, for the winning of the mines of the silver and gold which
is there;
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C8V4">&nbsp;</a>And that by their policy and patience they had conquered all the place, though it were very far from
them; and the kings also that came against them from the uttermost part of the earth, till they had discomfited
them, and given them a great overthrow, so that the rest did give them tribute every year:
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C8V5">&nbsp;</a>Beside this, how they had discomfited in battle Philip, and Perseus, king of the Citims, with others
that lifted up themselves against them, and had overcome them:
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C8V6">&nbsp;</a>How also Antiochus the great king of Asia, that came against them in battle, having an hundred and twenty
elephants, with horsemen, and chariots, and a very great army, was discomfited by them;
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C8V7">&nbsp;</a>And how they took him alive, and covenanted that he and such as reigned after him should pay a great
tribute, and give hostages, and that which was agreed upon,
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C8V8">&nbsp;</a>And the country of India, and Media and Lydia and of the goodliest countries, which they took of him,
and gave to king Eumenes:
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C8V9">&nbsp;</a>Moreover how the Grecians had determined to come and destroy them;
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C8V10">&nbsp;</a>And that they, having knowledge thereof sent against them a certain captain, and fighting with them slew
many of them, and carried away captives their wives and their children, and spoiled them, and took possession
of their lands, and pulled down their strong holds, and brought them to be their servants unto this day:
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C8V11">&nbsp;</a>It was told him besides, how they destroyed and brought under their dominion all other kingdoms and isles
that at any time resisted them;
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C8V12">&nbsp;</a>But with their friends and such as relied upon them they kept amity: and that they had conquered kingdoms
both far and nigh, insomuch as all that heard of their name were afraid of them:
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C8V13">&nbsp;</a>Also that, whom they would help to a kingdom, those reign; and whom again they would, they displace:
finally, that they were greatly exalted:
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C8V14">&nbsp;</a>Yet for all this none of them wore a crown or was clothed in purple, to be magnified thereby:
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C8V15">&nbsp;</a>Moreover how they had made for themselves a senate house, wherein three hundred and twenty men sat in
council daily, consulting alway for the people, to the end they might be well ordered:
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C8V16">&nbsp;</a>And that they committed their government to one man every year, who ruled over all their country, and
that all were obedient to that one, and that there was neither envy nor emmulation among them.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C8V17">&nbsp;</a>In consideration of these things, Judas chose Eupolemus the son of John, the son of Accos, and Jason
the son of Eleazar, and sent them to Rome, to make a league of amity and confederacy with them,
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C8V18">&nbsp;</a>And to intreat them that they would take the yoke from them; for they saw that the kingdom of the Grecians
did oppress Israel with servitude.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C8V19">&nbsp;</a>They went therefore to Rome, which was a very great journey, and came into the senate, where they spake
and said.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C8V20">&nbsp;</a>Judas Maccabeus with his brethren, and the people of the Jews, have sent us unto you, to make a confederacy
and peace with you, and that we might be registered your confederates and friends.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C8V21">&nbsp;</a>So that matter pleased the Romans well.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C8V22">&nbsp;</a>And this is the copy of the epistle which the senate wrote back again in tables of brass, and sent to
Jerusalem, that there they might have by them a memorial of peace and confederacy:
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C8V23">&nbsp;</a>Good success be to the Romans, and to the people of the Jews, by sea and by land for ever: the sword
also and enemy be far from them,
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C8V24">&nbsp;</a>If there come first any war upon the Romans or any of their confederates throughout all their dominion,
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C8V25">&nbsp;</a>The people of the Jews shall help them, as the time shall be appointed, with all their heart:
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C8V26">&nbsp;</a>Neither shall they give any thing unto them that make war upon them, or aid them with victuals, weapons,
money, or ships, as it hath seemed good unto the Romans; but they shall keep their covenants without
taking any thing therefore.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C8V27">&nbsp;</a>In the same manner also, if war come first upon the nation of the Jews, the Romans shall help them with
all their heart, according as the time shall be appointed them:
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C8V28">&nbsp;</a>Neither shall victuals be given to them that take part against them, or weapons, or money, or ships,
as it hath seemed good to the Romans; but they shall keep their covenants, and that without deceit.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C8V29">&nbsp;</a>According to these articles did the Romans make a covenant with the people of the Jews.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 30</span><a name="C8V30">&nbsp;</a>Howbeit if hereafter the one party or the other shall think to meet to add or diminish any thing, they
may do it at their pleasures, and whatsoever they shall add or take away shall be ratified.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 31</span><a name="C8V31">&nbsp;</a>And as touching the evils that Demetrius doeth to the Jews, we have written unto him, saying, Wherefore
thou made thy yoke heavy upon our friends and confederates the Jews?
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 32</span><a name="C8V32">&nbsp;</a>If therefore they complain any more against thee, we will do them justice, and fight with thee by sea
and by land.
