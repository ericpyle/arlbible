 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C4V1">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">When therefore the Lord knew how the Pharisees had heard that Jesus made and baptized more disciples
than John,
</span> <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C4V2">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">(Though Jesus himself baptized not, but his disciples,)
</span> <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C4V3">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">He left Judaea, and departed again into Galilee.
</span> <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C4V4">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And he must needs go through Samaria.
</span> <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C4V5">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Then cometh he to a city of Samaria, which is called Sychar, near to the parcel of ground that Jacob
gave to his son Joseph.
</span> <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C4V6">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Now Jacob’s well was there. Jesus therefore, being wearied with
</span><span class="add">his</span><span class="wj"> journey, sat thus on the well:
</span><span class="add">and</span><span class="wj"> it was about the sixth hour.
</span> <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C4V7">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">There cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water: Jesus saith unto her, Give me to drink.
</span> <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C4V8">&nbsp;</a>(For his disciples were gone away unto the city to buy meat.)
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C4V9">&nbsp;</a>Then saith the woman of Samaria unto him, How is it that thou, being a Jew, askest drink of me, which
am a woman of Samaria? for the Jews have no dealings with the Samaritans.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C4V10">&nbsp;</a>Jesus answered and said unto her,
<span class="wj">If thou knewest the gift of God, and who it is that saith to thee, Give me to drink; thou wouldest have
asked of him, and he would have given thee living water.
</span> <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C4V11">&nbsp;</a>The woman saith unto him, Sir, thou hast nothing to draw with, and the well is deep: from whence then
hast thou that living water?
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C4V12">&nbsp;</a>Art thou greater than our father Jacob, which gave us the well, and drank thereof himself, and his children,
and his cattle?
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C4V13">&nbsp;</a>Jesus answered and said unto her,
<span class="wj">Whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again:
</span> <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C4V14">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">But whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall
give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life.
</span> <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C4V15">&nbsp;</a>The woman saith unto him, Sir, give me this water, that I thirst not, neither come hither to draw.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C4V16">&nbsp;</a>Jesus saith unto her,
<span class="wj">Go, call thy husband, and come hither.
</span> <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C4V17">&nbsp;</a>The woman answered and said, I have no husband. Jesus said unto her,
<span class="wj">Thou hast well said, I have no husband:
</span> <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C4V18">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">For thou hast had five husbands; and he whom thou now hast is not thy husband: in that saidst thou truly.
</span> <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C4V19">&nbsp;</a>The woman saith unto him, Sir, I perceive that thou art a prophet.
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C4V20">&nbsp;</a>Our fathers worshipped in this mountain; and ye say, that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to
worship.
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C4V21">&nbsp;</a>Jesus saith unto her,
<span class="wj">Woman, believe me, the hour cometh, when ye shall neither in this mountain, nor yet at Jerusalem, worship
the Father.
</span> <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C4V22">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Ye worship ye know not what: we know what we worship: for salvation is of the Jews.
</span> <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C4V23">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in
truth: for the Father seeketh such to worship him.
</span> <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C4V24">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">God
</span><span class="add">is</span><span class="wj"> a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship
</span><span class="add">him</span><span class="wj"> in spirit and in truth.
</span> <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C4V25">&nbsp;</a>The woman saith unto him, I know that Messias cometh, which is called Christ: when he is come, he will
tell us all things.
 <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C4V26">&nbsp;</a>Jesus saith unto her,
<span class="wj">I that speak unto thee am
</span><span class="add">he.</span></div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C4V27">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And upon this came his disciples, and marvelled that he talked with the woman: yet no man said, What
seekest thou? or, Why talkest thou with her?
</span> <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C4V28">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">The woman then left her waterpot, and went her way into the city, and saith to the men,
</span> <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C4V29">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Come, see a man, which told me all things that ever I did: is not this the Christ?
</span> <span class="verse"> 30</span><a name="C4V30">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Then they went out of the city, and came unto him.</span></div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 31</span><a name="C4V31">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">In the mean while his disciples prayed him, saying, Master, eat.
</span> <span class="verse"> 32</span><a name="C4V32">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">But he said unto them, I have meat to eat that ye know not of.
</span> <span class="verse"> 33</span><a name="C4V33">&nbsp;</a>Therefore said the disciples one to another, Hath any man brought him
<span class="add">ought</span> to eat?
 <span class="verse"> 34</span><a name="C4V34">&nbsp;</a>Jesus saith unto them,
<span class="wj">My meat is to do the will of him that sent me, and to finish his work.
</span> <span class="verse"> 35</span><a name="C4V35">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Say not ye, There are yet four months, and
</span><span class="add">then</span><span class="wj"> cometh harvest? behold, I say unto you, Lift up your eyes, and look on the fields; for they are white
already to harvest.
</span> <span class="verse"> 36</span><a name="C4V36">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And he that reapeth receiveth wages, and gathereth fruit unto life eternal: that both he that soweth
and he that reapeth may rejoice together.
</span> <span class="verse"> 37</span><a name="C4V37">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And herein is that saying true, One soweth, and another reapeth.
</span> <span class="verse"> 38</span><a name="C4V38">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">I sent you to reap that whereon ye bestowed no labour: other men laboured, and ye are entered into their
labours.</span></div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 39</span><a name="C4V39">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And many of the Samaritans of that city believed on him for the saying of the woman, which testified,
He told me all that ever I did.
</span> <span class="verse"> 40</span><a name="C4V40">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">So when the Samaritans were come unto him, they besought him that he would tarry with them: and he abode
there two days.
</span> <span class="verse"> 41</span><a name="C4V41">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And many more believed because of his own word;
</span> <span class="verse"> 42</span><a name="C4V42">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And said unto the woman, Now we believe, not because of thy saying: for we have heard
</span><span class="add">him</span><span class="wj"> ourselves, and know that this is indeed the Christ, the Saviour of the world.</span></div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 43</span><a name="C4V43">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Now after two days he departed thence, and went into Galilee.
</span> <span class="verse"> 44</span><a name="C4V44">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">For Jesus himself testified, that a prophet hath no honour in his own country.
</span> <span class="verse"> 45</span><a name="C4V45">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Then when he was come into Galilee, the Galilaeans received him, having seen all the things that he did
at Jerusalem at the feast: for they also went unto the feast.
</span> <span class="verse"> 46</span><a name="C4V46">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">So Jesus came again into Cana of Galilee, where he made the water wine. And there was a certain nobleman,
whose son was sick at Capernaum.
</span> <span class="verse"> 47</span><a name="C4V47">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">When he heard that Jesus was come out of Judaea into Galilee, he went unto him, and besought him that
he would come down, and heal his son: for he was at the point of death.
</span> <span class="verse"> 48</span><a name="C4V48">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Then said Jesus unto him, Except ye see signs and wonders, ye will not believe.
</span> <span class="verse"> 49</span><a name="C4V49">&nbsp;</a>The nobleman saith unto him, Sir, come down ere my child die.
 <span class="verse"> 50</span><a name="C4V50">&nbsp;</a>Jesus saith unto him,
<span class="wj">Go thy way; thy son liveth.</span> And the man believed the word that Jesus had spoken unto him, and he went his way.
 <span class="verse"> 51</span><a name="C4V51">&nbsp;</a>And as he was now going down, his servants met him, and told
<span class="add">him,
</span> saying, Thy son liveth.
 <span class="verse"> 52</span><a name="C4V52">&nbsp;</a>Then enquired he of them the hour when he began to amend. And they said unto him, Yesterday at the seventh
hour the fever left him.
 <span class="verse"> 53</span><a name="C4V53">&nbsp;</a>So the father knew that
<span class="add">it was</span> at the same hour, in the which Jesus said unto him,
<span class="wj">Thy son liveth:</span> and himself believed, and his whole house.
 <span class="verse"> 54</span><a name="C4V54">&nbsp;</a>This
<span class="add">is</span> again the second miracle
<span class="add">that</span> Jesus did, when he was come out of Judaea into Galilee.
