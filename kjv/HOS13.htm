 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C13V1">&nbsp;</a>When Ephraim spake trembling, he exalted himself in Israel; but when he offended in Baal, he died.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C13V2">&nbsp;</a>And now they sin more and more, and have made them molten images of their silver,
<span class="add">and</span> idols according to their own understanding, all of it the work of the craftsmen: they say of them, Let
the men that sacrifice kiss the calves.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C13V3">&nbsp;</a>Therefore they shall be as the morning cloud, and as the early dew that passeth away, as the chaff
<span class="add">that</span> is driven with the whirlwind out of the floor, and as the smoke out of the chimney.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C13V4">&nbsp;</a>Yet I
<span class="add">am</span> the LORD thy God from the land of Egypt, and thou shalt know no god but me: for
<span class="add">there is</span> no saviour beside me.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C13V5">&nbsp;</a>I did know thee in the wilderness, in the land of great drought.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C13V6">&nbsp;</a>According to their pasture, so were they filled; they were filled, and their heart was exalted; therefore
have they forgotten me.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C13V7">&nbsp;</a>Therefore I will be unto them as a lion: as a leopard by the way will I observe
<span class="add">them:
</span> <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C13V8">&nbsp;</a>I will meet them as a bear
<span class="add">that is</span> bereaved
<span class="add">of her whelps,</span> and will rend the caul of their heart, and there will I devour them like a lion: the wild beast shall
tear them.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C13V9">&nbsp;</a>O Israel, thou hast destroyed thyself; but in me
<span class="add">is</span> thine help.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C13V10">&nbsp;</a>I will be thy king: where
<span class="add">is any other</span> that may save thee in all thy cities? and thy judges of whom thou saidst, Give me a king and princes?
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C13V11">&nbsp;</a>I gave thee a king in mine anger, and took
<span class="add">him</span> away in my wrath.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C13V12">&nbsp;</a>The iniquity of Ephraim
<span class="add">is</span> bound up; his sin
<span class="add">is</span> hid.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C13V13">&nbsp;</a>The sorrows of a travailing woman shall come upon him: he
<span class="add">is</span> an unwise son; for he should not stay long in
<span class="add">the place of</span> the breaking forth of children.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C13V14">&nbsp;</a>I will ransom them from the power of the grave; I will redeem them from death: O death, I will be thy
plagues; O grave, I will be thy destruction: repentance shall be hid from mine eyes.

<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C13V15">&nbsp;</a>Though he be fruitful among
<span class="add">his</span> brethren, an east wind shall come, the wind of the LORD shall come up from the wilderness, and his spring
shall become dry, and his fountain shall be dried up: he shall spoil the treasure of all pleasant vessels.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C13V16">&nbsp;</a>Samaria shall become desolate; for she hath rebelled against her God: they shall fall by the sword: their
infants shall be dashed in pieces, and their women with child shall be ripped up.
