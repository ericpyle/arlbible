<div class="chapterlabel"> 9</div><div class="p">
 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C9V1">&nbsp;</a>Then Esdras rising from the court of the temple went to the chamber of Joanan the son of Eliasib,
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C9V2">&nbsp;</a>And remained there, and did eat no meat nor drink water, mourning for the great iniquities of the multitude.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C9V3">&nbsp;</a>And there was a proclamation in all Jewry and Jerusalem to all them that were of the captivity, that
they should be gathered together at Jerusalem:
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C9V4">&nbsp;</a>And that whosoever met not there within two or three days according as the elders that bare rule appointed,
their cattle should be seized to the use of the temple, and himself cast out from them that were of the
captivity.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C9V5">&nbsp;</a>And in three days were all they of the tribe of Judah and Benjamin gathered together at Jerusalem the
twentieth day of the ninth month.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C9V6">&nbsp;</a>And all the multitude sat trembling in the broad court of the temple because of the present foul weather.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C9V7">&nbsp;</a>So Esdras arose up, and said unto them, Ye have transgressed the law in marrying strange wives, thereby
to increase the sins of Israel.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C9V8">&nbsp;</a>And now by confessing give glory unto the Lord God of our fathers,
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C9V9">&nbsp;</a>And do his will, and separate yourselves from the heathen of the land, and from the strange women.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C9V10">&nbsp;</a>Then cried the whole multitude, and said with a loud voice, Like as thou hast spoken, so will we do.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C9V11">&nbsp;</a>But forasmuch as the people are many, and it is foul weather, so that we cannot stand without, and this
is not a work of a day or two, seeing our sin in these things is spread far:
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C9V12">&nbsp;</a>Therefore let the rulers of the multitude stay, and let all them of our habitations that have strange
wives come at the time appointed,
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C9V13">&nbsp;</a>And with them the rulers and judges of every place, till we turn away the wrath of the Lord from us for
this matter.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C9V14">&nbsp;</a>Then Jonathan the son of Azael and Ezechias the son of Theocanus accordingly took this matter upon them:
and Mosollam and Levis and Sabbatheus helped them.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C9V15">&nbsp;</a>And they that were of the captivity did according to all these things.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C9V16">&nbsp;</a>And Esdras the priest chose unto him the principal men of their families, all by name: and in the first
day of the tenth month they sat together to examine the matter.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C9V17">&nbsp;</a>So their cause that held strange wives was brought to an end in the first day of the first month.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C9V18">&nbsp;</a>And of the priests that were come together, and had strange wives, there were found:
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C9V19">&nbsp;</a>Of the sons of Jesus the son of Josedec, and his brethren; Matthelas and Eleazar, and Joribus and Joadanus.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C9V20">&nbsp;</a>And they gave their hands to put away their wives and to offer rams to make reconcilement for their errors.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C9V21">&nbsp;</a>And of the sons of Emmer; Ananias, and Zabdeus, and Eanes, and Sameius, and Hiereel, and Azarias.
</div>

and Manasseas.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 32</span><a name="C9V32">&nbsp;</a>And of the sons of Annas; Elionas and Aseas, and Melchias, and Sabbeus, and Simon Chosameus.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 33</span><a name="C9V33">&nbsp;</a>And of the sons of Asom; Altaneus, and Matthias, and Baanaia, Eliphalet, and Manasses, and Semei.

</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 36</span><a name="C9V36">&nbsp;</a>All these had taken strange wives, and they put them away with their children.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 37</span><a name="C9V37">&nbsp;</a>And the priests and Levites, and they that were of Israel, dwelt in Jerusalem, and in the country, in
the first day of the seventh month: so the children of Israel were in their habitations.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 38</span><a name="C9V38">&nbsp;</a>And the whole multitude came together with one accord into the broad place of the holy porch toward the
east:
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 39</span><a name="C9V39">&nbsp;</a>And they spake unto Esdras the priest and reader, that he would bring the law of Moses, that was given
of the Lord God of Israel.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 40</span><a name="C9V40">&nbsp;</a>So Esdras the chief priest brought the law unto the whole multitude from man to woman, and to all the
priests, to hear law in the first day of the seventh month.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 41</span><a name="C9V41">&nbsp;</a>And he read in the broad court before the holy porch from morning unto midday, before both men and women;
and the multitude gave heed unto the law.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 42</span><a name="C9V42">&nbsp;</a>And Esdras the priest and reader of the law stood up upon a pulpit of wood, which was made for that purpose.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 43</span><a name="C9V43">&nbsp;</a>And there stood up by him Mattathias, Sammus, Ananias, Azarias, Urias, Ezecias, Balasamus, upon the right
hand:
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 44</span><a name="C9V44">&nbsp;</a>And upon his left hand stood Phaldaius, Misael, Melchias, Lothasubus, and Nabarias.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 45</span><a name="C9V45">&nbsp;</a>Then took Esdras the book of the law before the multitude: for he sat honourably in the first place in
the sight of them all.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 46</span><a name="C9V46">&nbsp;</a>And when he opened the law, they stood all straight up. So Esdras blessed the Lord God most High, the
God of hosts, Almighty.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 47</span><a name="C9V47">&nbsp;</a>And all the people answered, Amen; and lifting up their hands they fell to the ground, and worshipped
the Lord.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 48</span><a name="C9V48">&nbsp;</a>Also Jesus, Anus, Sarabias, Adinus, Jacubus, Sabateas, Auteas, Maianeas, and Calitas, Asrias, and Joazabdus,
and Ananias, Biatas, the Levites, taught the law of the Lord, making them withal to understand it.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 49</span><a name="C9V49">&nbsp;</a>Then spake Attharates unto Esdras the chief priest. and reader, and to the Levites that taught the multitude,
even to all, saying,
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 50</span><a name="C9V50">&nbsp;</a>This day is holy unto the Lord; (for they all wept when they heard the law:)
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 51</span><a name="C9V51">&nbsp;</a>Go then, and eat the fat, and drink the sweet, and send part to them that have nothing;
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 52</span><a name="C9V52">&nbsp;</a>For this day is holy unto the Lord: and be not sorrowful; for the Lord will bring you to honour.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 53</span><a name="C9V53">&nbsp;</a>So the Levites published all things to the people, saying, This day is holy to the Lord; be not sorrowful.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 54</span><a name="C9V54">&nbsp;</a>Then went they their way, every one to eat and drink, and make merry, and to give part to them that had
nothing, and to make great cheer;
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 55</span><a name="C9V55">&nbsp;</a>Because they understood the words wherein they were instructed, and for the which they had been assembled.
