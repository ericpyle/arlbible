 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C19V1">&nbsp;</a>And it came to pass, when king Hezekiah heard
<span class="add">it,</span> that he rent his clothes, and covered himself with sackcloth, and went into the house of the LORD.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C19V2">&nbsp;</a>And he sent Eliakim, which
<span class="add">was</span> over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and the elders of the priests, covered with sackcloth, to
Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C19V3">&nbsp;</a>And they said unto him, Thus saith Hezekiah, This day
<span class="add">is</span> a day of trouble, and of rebuke, and blasphemy: for the children are come to the birth, and
<span class="add">there is</span> not strength to bring forth.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C19V4">&nbsp;</a>It may be the LORD thy God will hear all the words of Rab-shakeh, whom the king of Assyria his master
hath sent to reproach the living God; and will reprove the words which the LORD thy God hath heard: wherefore
lift up
<span class="add">thy</span> prayer for the remnant that are left.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C19V5">&nbsp;</a>So the servants of king Hezekiah came to Isaiah.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C19V6">&nbsp;</a>And Isaiah said unto them, Thus shall ye say to your master, Thus saith the LORD, Be not afraid of the
words which thou hast heard, with which the servants of the king of Assyria have blasphemed me.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C19V7">&nbsp;</a>Behold, I will send a blast upon him, and he shall hear a rumour, and shall return to his own land; and
I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C19V8">&nbsp;</a>So Rab-shakeh returned, and found the king of Assyria warring against Libnah: for he had heard that he
was departed from Lachish.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C19V9">&nbsp;</a>And when he heard say of Tirhakah king of Ethiopia, Behold, he is come out to fight against thee: he
sent messengers again unto Hezekiah, saying,
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C19V10">&nbsp;</a>Thus shall ye speak to Hezekiah king of Judah, saying, Let not thy God in whom thou trustest deceive
thee, saying, Jerusalem shall not be delivered into the hand of the king of Assyria.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C19V11">&nbsp;</a>Behold, thou hast heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all lands, by destroying them utterly:
and shalt thou be delivered?
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C19V12">&nbsp;</a>Have the gods of the nations delivered them which my fathers have destroyed;
<span class="add">as</span> Gozan, and Haran, and Rezeph, and the children of Eden which
<span class="add">were</span> in Thelasar?
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C19V13">&nbsp;</a>Where
<span class="add">is</span> the king of Hamath, and the king of Arpad, and the king of the city of Sepharvaim, of Hena, and Ivah?
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C19V14">&nbsp;</a>And Hezekiah received the letter of the hand of the messengers, and read it: and Hezekiah went up into
the house of the LORD, and spread it before the LORD.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C19V15">&nbsp;</a>And Hezekiah prayed before the LORD, and said, O LORD God of Israel, which dwellest
<span class="add">between</span> the cherubims, thou art the God,
<span class="add">even</span> thou alone, of all the kingdoms of the earth: thou hast made heaven and earth.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C19V16">&nbsp;</a>LORD, bow down thine ear, and hear: open, LORD, thine eyes, and see: and hear the words of Sennacherib,
which hath sent him to reproach the living God.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C19V17">&nbsp;</a>Of a truth, LORD, the kings of Assyria have destroyed the nations and their lands,
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C19V18">&nbsp;</a>And have cast their gods into the fire: for they
<span class="add">were</span> no gods, but the work of men’s hands, wood and stone: therefore they have destroyed them.
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C19V19">&nbsp;</a>Now therefore, O LORD our God, I beseech thee, save thou us out of his hand, that all the kingdoms of
the earth may know that thou
<span class="add">art</span> the LORD God,
<span class="add">even</span> thou only.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C19V20">&nbsp;</a>Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent to Hezekiah, saying, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel,
<span class="add">That</span> which thou hast prayed to me against Sennacherib king of Assyria I have heard.
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C19V21">&nbsp;</a>This
<span class="add">is</span> the word that the LORD hath spoken concerning him; The virgin the daughter of Zion hath despised thee,
<span class="add">and</span> laughed thee to scorn; the daughter of Jerusalem hath shaken her head at thee.
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C19V22">&nbsp;</a>Whom hast thou reproached and blasphemed? and against whom hast thou exalted
<span class="add">thy</span> voice, and lifted up thine eyes on high?
<span class="add">even</span> against the Holy
<span class="add">One</span> of Israel.
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C19V23">&nbsp;</a>By the messengers thou hast reproached the Lord, and hast said, With the multitude of my chariots I am
come up to the height of the mountains, to the sides of Lebanon, and will cut down the tall cedar trees
thereof,
<span class="add">and</span> the choice fir trees thereof: and I will enter into the lodgings of his borders,
<span class="add">and into</span> the forest of his Carmel.
 <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C19V24">&nbsp;</a>I have digged and drunk strange waters, and with the sole of my feet have I dried up all the rivers of
besieged places.
 <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C19V25">&nbsp;</a>Hast thou not heard long ago
<span class="add">how</span> I have done it,
<span class="add">and</span> of ancient times that I have formed it? now have I brought it to pass, that thou shouldest be to lay
waste fenced cities
<span class="add">into</span> ruinous heaps.
 <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C19V26">&nbsp;</a>Therefore their inhabitants were of small power, they were dismayed and confounded; they were
<span class="add">as</span> the grass of the field, and
<span class="add">as</span> the green herb,
<span class="add">as</span> the grass on the house tops, and
<span class="add">as corn</span> blasted before it be grown up.
 <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C19V27">&nbsp;</a>But I know thy abode, and thy going out, and thy coming in, and thy rage against me.
 <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C19V28">&nbsp;</a>Because thy rage against me and thy tumult is come up into mine ears, therefore I will put my hook in
thy nose, and my bridle in thy lips, and I will turn thee back by the way by which thou camest.
 <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C19V29">&nbsp;</a>And this
<span class="add">shall be</span> a sign unto thee, Ye shall eat this year such things as grow of themselves, and in the second year that
which springeth of the same; and in the third year sow ye, and reap, and plant vineyards, and eat the
fruits thereof.
 <span class="verse"> 30</span><a name="C19V30">&nbsp;</a>And the remnant that is escaped of the house of Judah shall yet again take root downward, and bear fruit
upward.
 <span class="verse"> 31</span><a name="C19V31">&nbsp;</a>For out of Jerusalem shall go forth a remnant, and they that escape out of mount Zion: the zeal of the
LORD
<span class="add">of hosts</span> shall do this.
 <span class="verse"> 32</span><a name="C19V32">&nbsp;</a>Therefore thus saith the LORD concerning the king of Assyria, He shall not come into this city, nor shoot
an arrow there, nor come before it with shield, nor cast a bank against it.
 <span class="verse"> 33</span><a name="C19V33">&nbsp;</a>By the way that he came, by the same shall he return, and shall not come into this city, saith the LORD.
 <span class="verse"> 34</span><a name="C19V34">&nbsp;</a>For I will defend this city, to save it, for mine own sake, and for my servant David’s sake.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 35</span><a name="C19V35">&nbsp;</a>And it came to pass that night, that the angel of the LORD went out, and smote in the camp of the Assyrians
an hundred fourscore and five thousand: and when they arose early in the morning, behold, they
<span class="add">were</span> all dead corpses.
 <span class="verse"> 36</span><a name="C19V36">&nbsp;</a>So Sennacherib king of Assyria departed, and went and returned, and dwelt at Nineveh.
 <span class="verse"> 37</span><a name="C19V37">&nbsp;</a>And it came to pass, as he was worshipping in the house of Nisroch his god, that Adrammelech and Sharezer
his sons smote him with the sword: and they escaped into the land of Armenia. And Esar-haddon his son
reigned in his stead.
