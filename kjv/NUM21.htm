 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C21V1">&nbsp;</a>And
<span class="add">when</span> king Arad the Canaanite, which dwelt in the south, heard tell that Israel came by the way of the spies;
then he fought against Israel, and took
<span class="add">some</span> of them prisoners.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C21V2">&nbsp;</a>And Israel vowed a vow unto the LORD, and said, If thou wilt indeed deliver this people into my hand,
then I will utterly destroy their cities.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C21V3">&nbsp;</a>And the LORD hearkened to the voice of Israel, and delivered up the Canaanites; and they utterly destroyed
them and their cities: and he called the name of the place Hormah.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C21V4">&nbsp;</a>And they journeyed from mount Hor by the way of the Red sea, to compass the land of Edom: and the soul
of the people was much discouraged because of the way.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C21V5">&nbsp;</a>And the people spake against God, and against Moses, Wherefore have ye brought us up out of Egypt to
die in the wilderness? for
<span class="add">there is</span> no bread, neither
<span class="add">is there any</span> water; and our soul loatheth this light bread.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C21V6">&nbsp;</a>And the LORD sent fiery serpents among the people, and they bit the people; and much people of Israel
died.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C21V7">&nbsp;</a>Therefore the people came to Moses, and said, We have sinned, for we have spoken against the LORD, and
against thee; pray unto the LORD, that he take away the serpents from us. And Moses prayed for the people.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C21V8">&nbsp;</a>And the LORD said unto Moses, Make thee a fiery serpent, and set it upon a pole: and it shall come to
pass, that every one that is bitten, when he looketh upon it, shall live.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C21V9">&nbsp;</a>And Moses made a serpent of brass, and put it upon a pole, and it came to pass, that if a serpent had
bitten any man, when he beheld the serpent of brass, he lived.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C21V10">&nbsp;</a>And the children of Israel set forward, and pitched in Oboth.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C21V11">&nbsp;</a>And they journeyed from Oboth, and pitched at Ije-abarim, in the wilderness which
<span class="add">is</span> before Moab, toward the sunrising.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C21V12">&nbsp;</a>From thence they removed, and pitched in the valley of Zared.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C21V13">&nbsp;</a>From thence they removed, and pitched on the other side of Arnon, which
<span class="add">is</span> in the wilderness that cometh out of the coasts of the Amorites: for Arnon
<span class="add">is</span> the border of Moab, between Moab and the Amorites.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C21V14">&nbsp;</a>Wherefore it is said in the book of the wars of the LORD, What he did in the Red sea, and in the brooks
of Arnon,
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C21V15">&nbsp;</a>And at the stream of the brooks that goeth down to the dwelling of Ar, and lieth upon the border of Moab.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C21V16">&nbsp;</a>And from thence
<span class="add">they went</span> to Beer: that
<span class="add">is</span> the well whereof the LORD spake unto Moses, Gather the people together, and I will give them water.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C21V17">&nbsp;</a>Then Israel sang this song, Spring up, O well; sing ye unto it:
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C21V18">&nbsp;</a>The princes digged the well, the nobles of the people digged it, by
<span class="add">the direction of</span> the lawgiver, with their staves. And from the wilderness
<span class="add">they went</span> to Mattanah:
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C21V19">&nbsp;</a>And from Mattanah to Nahaliel: and from Nahaliel to Bamoth:
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C21V20">&nbsp;</a>And from Bamoth
<span class="add">in</span> the valley, that
<span class="add">is</span> in the country of Moab, to the top of Pisgah, which looketh toward Jeshimon.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C21V21">&nbsp;</a>And Israel sent messengers unto Sihon king of the Amorites, saying,
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C21V22">&nbsp;</a>Let me pass through thy land: we will not turn into the fields, or into the vineyards; we will not drink
<span class="add">of</span> the waters of the well:
<span class="add">but</span> we will go along by the king’s
<span class="add">high</span> way, until we be past thy borders.
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C21V23">&nbsp;</a>And Sihon would not suffer Israel to pass through his border: but Sihon gathered all his people together,
and went out against Israel into the wilderness: and he came to Jahaz, and fought against Israel.
 <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C21V24">&nbsp;</a>And Israel smote him with the edge of the sword, and possessed his land from Arnon unto Jabbok, even
unto the children of Ammon: for the border of the children of Ammon
<span class="add">was</span> strong.
 <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C21V25">&nbsp;</a>And Israel took all these cities: and Israel dwelt in all the cities of the Amorites, in Heshbon, and
in all the villages thereof.
 <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C21V26">&nbsp;</a>For Heshbon
<span class="add">was</span> the city of Sihon the king of the Amorites, who had fought against the former king of Moab, and taken
all his land out of his hand, even unto Arnon.
 <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C21V27">&nbsp;</a>Wherefore they that speak in proverbs say, Come into Heshbon, let the city of Sihon be built and prepared:
 <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C21V28">&nbsp;</a>For there is a fire gone out of Heshbon, a flame from the city of Sihon: it hath consumed Ar of Moab,
<span class="add">and</span> the lords of the high places of Arnon.
 <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C21V29">&nbsp;</a>Woe to thee, Moab! thou art undone, O people of Chemosh: he hath given his sons that escaped, and his
daughters, into captivity unto Sihon king of the Amorites.
 <span class="verse"> 30</span><a name="C21V30">&nbsp;</a>We have shot at them; Heshbon is perished even unto Dibon, and we have laid them waste even unto Nophah,
which
<span class="add">reacheth</span> unto Medeba.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 31</span><a name="C21V31">&nbsp;</a>Thus Israel dwelt in the land of the Amorites.
 <span class="verse"> 32</span><a name="C21V32">&nbsp;</a>And Moses sent to spy out Jaazer, and they took the villages thereof, and drove out the Amorites that
<span class="add">were</span> there.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 33</span><a name="C21V33">&nbsp;</a>And they turned and went up by the way of Bashan: and Og the king of Bashan went out against them, he,
and all his people, to the battle at Edrei.
 <span class="verse"> 34</span><a name="C21V34">&nbsp;</a>And the LORD said unto Moses, Fear him not: for I have delivered him into thy hand, and all his people,
and his land; and thou shalt do to him as thou didst unto Sihon king of the Amorites, which dwelt at
Heshbon.
 <span class="verse"> 35</span><a name="C21V35">&nbsp;</a>So they smote him, and his sons, and all his people, until there was none left him alive: and they possessed
his land.
