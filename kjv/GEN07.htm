 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C7V1">&nbsp;</a>And the LORD said unto Noah, Come thou and all thy house into the ark; for thee have I seen righteous
before me in this generation.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C7V2">&nbsp;</a>Of every clean beast thou shalt take to thee by sevens, the male and his female: and of beasts that
<span class="add">are</span> not clean by two, the male and his female.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C7V3">&nbsp;</a>Of fowls also of the air by sevens, the male and the female; to keep seed alive upon the face of all
the earth.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C7V4">&nbsp;</a>For yet seven days, and I will cause it to rain upon the earth forty days and forty nights; and every
living substance that I have made will I destroy from off the face of the earth.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C7V5">&nbsp;</a>And Noah did according unto all that the LORD commanded him.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C7V6">&nbsp;</a>And Noah
<span class="add">was</span> six hundred years old when the flood of waters was upon the earth.

 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C7V12">&nbsp;</a>And the rain was upon the earth forty days and forty nights.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C7V13">&nbsp;</a>In the selfsame day entered Noah, and Shem, and Ham, and Japheth, the sons of Noah, and Noah’s wife,
and the three wives of his sons with them, into the ark;
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C7V14">&nbsp;</a>They, and every beast after his kind, and all the cattle after their kind, and every creeping thing that
creepeth upon the earth after his kind, and every fowl after his kind, every bird of every sort.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C7V15">&nbsp;</a>And they went in unto Noah into the ark, two and two of all flesh, wherein
<span class="add">is</span> the breath of life.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C7V16">&nbsp;</a>And they that went in, went in male and female of all flesh, as God had commanded him: and the LORD shut
him in.

lift up above the earth.

the waters.
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C7V19">&nbsp;</a>And the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth; and all the high hills, that
<span class="add">were</span> under the whole heaven, were covered.
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C7V20">&nbsp;</a>Fifteen cubits upward did the waters prevail; and the mountains were covered.

creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth, and every man:

<span class="add">was</span> the breath of life, of all that
<span class="add">was</span> in the dry
<span class="add">land,</span> died.
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C7V23">&nbsp;</a>And every living substance was destroyed which was upon the face of the ground, both man, and cattle,
and the creeping things, and the fowl of the heaven; and they were destroyed from the earth: and Noah
only remained
<span class="add">alive,</span> and they that
<span class="add">were</span> with him in the ark.
