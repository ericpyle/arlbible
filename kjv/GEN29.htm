 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C29V1">&nbsp;</a>Then Jacob went on his journey, and came into the land of the people of the east.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C29V2">&nbsp;</a>And he looked, and behold a well in the field, and, lo, there
<span class="add">were
</span> three flocks of sheep lying by it; for out of that well they watered the flocks: and a great stone
<span class="add">was</span> upon the well’s mouth.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C29V3">&nbsp;</a>And thither were all the flocks gathered: and they rolled the stone from the well’s mouth, and watered
the sheep, and put the stone again upon the well’s mouth in his place.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C29V4">&nbsp;</a>And Jacob said unto them, My brethren, whence
<span class="add">be</span> ye? And they said, Of Haran
<span class="add">are</span> we.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C29V5">&nbsp;</a>And he said unto them, Know ye Laban the son of Nahor? And they said, We know
<span class="add">him.
</span> <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C29V6">&nbsp;</a>And he said unto them,
<span class="add">Is</span> he well? And they said,
<span class="add">He is
</span> well: and, behold, Rachel his daughter cometh with the sheep.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C29V7">&nbsp;</a>And he said, Lo,
<span class="add">it is</span> yet high day, neither
<span class="add">is it
</span> time that the cattle should be gathered together: water ye the sheep, and go
<span class="add">and</span> feed
<span class="add">them.
</span> <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C29V8">&nbsp;</a>And they said, We cannot, until all the flocks be gathered together, and
<span class="add">till</span> they roll the stone from the well’s mouth; then we water the sheep.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C29V9">&nbsp;</a>And while he yet spake with them, Rachel came with her father’s sheep: for she kept them.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C29V10">&nbsp;</a>And it came to pass, when Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of Laban his mother’s brother, and the sheep
of Laban his mother’s brother, that Jacob went near, and rolled the stone from the well’s mouth, and
watered the flock of Laban his mother’s brother.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C29V11">&nbsp;</a>And Jacob kissed Rachel, and lifted up his voice, and wept.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C29V12">&nbsp;</a>And Jacob told Rachel that he
<span class="add">was</span> her father’s brother, and that he
<span class="add">was</span> Rebekah’s son: and she ran and told her father.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C29V13">&nbsp;</a>And it came to pass, when Laban heard the tidings of Jacob his sister’s son, that he ran to meet him,
and embraced him, and kissed him, and brought him to his house. And he told Laban all these things.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C29V14">&nbsp;</a>And Laban said to him, Surely thou
<span class="add">art</span> my bone and my flesh. And he abode with him the space of a month.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C29V15">&nbsp;</a>And Laban said unto Jacob, Because thou
<span class="add">art</span> my brother, shouldest thou therefore serve me for nought? tell me, what
<span class="add">shall
</span> thy wages
<span class="add">be?
</span> <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C29V16">&nbsp;</a>And Laban had two daughters: the name of the elder
<span class="add">was</span> Leah, and the name of the younger
<span class="add">was</span> Rachel.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C29V17">&nbsp;</a>Leah
<span class="add">was</span> tender eyed; but Rachel was beautiful and well favoured.
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C29V18">&nbsp;</a>And Jacob loved Rachel; and said, I will serve thee seven years for Rachel thy younger daughter.
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C29V19">&nbsp;</a>And Laban said,
<span class="add">It is</span> better that I give her to thee, than that I should give her to another man: abide with me.
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C29V20">&nbsp;</a>And Jacob served seven years for Rachel; and they seemed unto him
<span class="add">but</span> a few days, for the love he had to her.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C29V21">&nbsp;</a>And Jacob said unto Laban, Give
<span class="add">me</span> my wife, for my days are fulfilled, that I may go in unto her.
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C29V22">&nbsp;</a>And Laban gathered together all the men of the place, and made a feast.
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C29V23">&nbsp;</a>And it came to pass in the evening, that he took Leah his daughter, and brought her to him; and he went
in unto her.
 <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C29V24">&nbsp;</a>And Laban gave unto his daughter Leah Zilpah his maid
<span class="add">for
</span> an handmaid.
 <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C29V25">&nbsp;</a>And it came to pass, that in the morning, behold, it
<span class="add">was
</span> Leah: and he said to Laban, What
<span class="add">is</span> this thou hast done unto me? did not I serve with thee for Rachel? wherefore then hast thou beguiled
me?
 <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C29V26">&nbsp;</a>And Laban said, It must not be so done in our country, to give the younger before the firstborn.
 <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C29V27">&nbsp;</a>Fulfil her week, and we will give thee this also for the service which thou shalt serve with me yet seven
other years.
 <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C29V28">&nbsp;</a>And Jacob did so, and fulfilled her week: and he gave him Rachel his daughter to wife also.
 <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C29V29">&nbsp;</a>And Laban gave to Rachel his daughter Bilhah his handmaid to be her maid.
 <span class="verse"> 30</span><a name="C29V30">&nbsp;</a>And he went in also unto Rachel, and he loved also Rachel more than Leah, and served with him yet seven
other years.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 31</span><a name="C29V31">&nbsp;</a>And when the LORD saw that Leah
<span class="add">was</span> hated, he opened her womb: but Rachel
<span class="add">was</span> barren.
 <span class="verse"> 32</span><a name="C29V32">&nbsp;</a>And Leah conceived, and bare a son, and she called his name Reuben: for she said, Surely the LORD hath
looked upon my affliction; now therefore my husband will love me.
 <span class="verse"> 33</span><a name="C29V33">&nbsp;</a>And she conceived again, and bare a son; and said, Because the LORD hath heard that I
<span class="add">was</span> hated, he hath therefore given me this
<span class="add">son
</span> also: and she called his name Simeon.
 <span class="verse"> 34</span><a name="C29V34">&nbsp;</a>And she conceived again, and bare a son; and said, Now this time will my husband be joined unto me, because
I have born him three sons: therefore was his name called Levi.
 <span class="verse"> 35</span><a name="C29V35">&nbsp;</a>And she conceived again, and bare a son: and she said, Now will I praise the LORD: therefore she called
his name Judah; and left bearing.
