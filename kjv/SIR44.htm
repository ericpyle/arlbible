 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C44V1">&nbsp;</a>Let us now praise famous men, and our fathers that begat us.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C44V2">&nbsp;</a>The Lord hath wrought great glory by them through his great power from the beginning.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C44V3">&nbsp;</a>Such as did bear rule in their kingdoms, men renowned for their power, giving counsel by their understanding,
and declaring prophecies:
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C44V4">&nbsp;</a>Leaders of the people by their counsels, and by their knowledge of learning meet for the people, wise
and eloquent are their instructions:
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C44V5">&nbsp;</a>Such as found out musical tunes, and recited verses in writing:
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C44V6">&nbsp;</a>Rich men furnished with ability, living peaceably in their habitations:
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C44V7">&nbsp;</a>All these were honoured in their generations, and were the glory of their times.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C44V8">&nbsp;</a>There be of them, that have left a name behind them, that their praises might be reported.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C44V9">&nbsp;</a>And some there be, which have no memorial; who are perished, as though they had never been; and are become
as though they had never been born; and their children after them.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C44V10">&nbsp;</a>But these were merciful men, whose righteousness hath not been forgotten.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C44V11">&nbsp;</a>With their seed shall continually remain a good inheritance, and their children are within the covenant.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C44V12">&nbsp;</a>Their seed standeth fast, and their children for their sakes.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C44V13">&nbsp;</a>Their seed shall remain for ever, and their glory shall not be blotted out.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C44V14">&nbsp;</a>Their bodies are buried in peace; but their name liveth for evermore.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C44V15">&nbsp;</a>The people will tell of their wisdom, and the congregation will shew forth their praise.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C44V16">&nbsp;</a>Enoch pleased the Lord, and was translated, being an example of repentance to all generations.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C44V17">&nbsp;</a>Noah was found perfect and righteous; in the time of wrath he was taken in exchange
<span class="add">for the world;</span> therefore was he left as a remnant unto the earth, when the flood came.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C44V18">&nbsp;</a>An everlasting covenant was made with him, that all flesh should perish no more by the flood.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C44V19">&nbsp;</a>Abraham was a great father of many people: in glory was there none like unto him;
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C44V20">&nbsp;</a>Who kept the law of the most High, and was in covenant with him: he established the covenant in his flesh;
and when he was proved, he was found faithful.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C44V21">&nbsp;</a>Therefore he assured him by an oath, that he would bless the nations in his seed, and that he would multiply
him as the dust of the earth, and exalt his seed as the stars, and cause them to inherit from sea to
sea, and from the river unto the utmost part of the land.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C44V22">&nbsp;</a>With Isaac did he establish likewise
<span class="add">for Abraham his father’s sake
</span> the blessing of all men, and the covenant, And made it rest upon the head of Jacob. He acknowledged
him in his blessing, and gave him an heritage, and divided his portions; among the twelve tribes did
he part them.
