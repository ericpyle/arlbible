 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C18V1">&nbsp;</a>Now it came to pass in the third year of Hoshea son of Elah king of Israel,
<span class="add">that</span> Hezekiah the son of Ahaz king of Judah began to reign.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C18V2">&nbsp;</a>Twenty and five years old was he when he began to reign; and he reigned twenty and nine years in Jerusalem.
His mother’s name also
<span class="add">was
</span> Abi, the daughter of Zachariah.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C18V3">&nbsp;</a>And he did
<span class="add">that which was</span> right in the sight of the LORD, according to all that David his father did.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C18V4">&nbsp;</a>He removed the high places, and brake the images, and cut down the groves, and brake in pieces the brasen
serpent that Moses had made: for unto those days the children of Israel did burn incense to it: and he
called it Nehushtan.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C18V5">&nbsp;</a>He trusted in the LORD God of Israel; so that after him was none like him among all the kings of Judah,
nor
<span class="add">any</span> that were before him.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C18V6">&nbsp;</a>For he clave to the LORD,
<span class="add">and</span> departed not from following him, but kept his commandments, which the LORD commanded Moses.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C18V7">&nbsp;</a>And the LORD was with him;
<span class="add">and</span> he prospered whithersoever he went forth: and he rebelled against the king of Assyria, and served him
not.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C18V8">&nbsp;</a>He smote the Philistines,
<span class="add">even</span> unto Gaza, and the borders thereof, from the tower of the watchmen to the fenced city.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C18V9">&nbsp;</a>And it came to pass in the fourth year of king Hezekiah, which
<span class="add">was</span> the seventh year of Hoshea son of Elah king of Israel,
<span class="add">that</span> Shalmaneser king of Assyria came up against Samaria, and besieged it.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C18V10">&nbsp;</a>And at the end of three years they took it:
<span class="add">even</span> in the sixth year of Hezekiah, that
<span class="add">is</span> the ninth year of Hoshea king of Israel, Samaria was taken.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C18V11">&nbsp;</a>And the king of Assyria did carry away Israel unto Assyria, and put them in Halah and in Habor
<span class="add">by</span> the river of Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes:
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C18V12">&nbsp;</a>Because they obeyed not the voice of the LORD their God, but transgressed his covenant,
<span class="add">and</span> all that Moses the servant of the LORD commanded, and would not hear
<span class="add">them,</span> nor do
<span class="add">them.
</span> <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C18V13">&nbsp;</a>Now in the fourteenth year of king Hezekiah did Sennacherib king of Assyria come up against all the fenced
cities of Judah, and took them.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C18V14">&nbsp;</a>And Hezekiah king of Judah sent to the king of Assyria to Lachish, saying, I have offended; return from
me: that which thou puttest on me will I bear. And the king of Assyria appointed unto Hezekiah king of
Judah three hundred talents of silver and thirty talents of gold.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C18V15">&nbsp;</a>And Hezekiah gave
<span class="add">him</span> all the silver that was found in the house of the LORD, and in the treasures of the king’s house.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C18V16">&nbsp;</a>At that time did Hezekiah cut off
<span class="add">the gold from</span> the doors of the temple of the LORD, and
<span class="add">from</span> the pillars which Hezekiah king of Judah had overlaid, and gave it to the king of Assyria.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C18V17">&nbsp;</a>And the king of Assyria sent Tartan and Rabsaris and Rab-shakeh from Lachish to king Hezekiah with a
great host against Jerusalem. And they went up and came to Jerusalem. And when they were come up, they
came and stood by the conduit of the upper pool, which is in the highway of the fuller’s field.
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C18V18">&nbsp;</a>And when they had called to the king, there came out to them Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, which
<span class="add">was</span> over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah the son of Asaph the recorder.
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C18V19">&nbsp;</a>And Rab- shakeh said unto them, Speak ye now to Hezekiah, Thus saith the great king, the king of Assyria,
What confidence is this wherein thou trustest?
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C18V20">&nbsp;</a>Thou sayest, (but
<span class="add">they are but</span> vain words,)
<span class="add">I have
</span> counsel and strength for the war. Now on whom dost thou trust, that thou rebellest against me?
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C18V21">&nbsp;</a>Now, behold, thou trustest upon the staff of this bruised reed,
<span class="add">even</span> upon Egypt, on which if a man lean, it will go into his hand, and pierce it: so is Pharaoh king of Egypt
unto all that trust on him.
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C18V22">&nbsp;</a>But if ye say unto me, We trust in the LORD our God:
<span class="add">is</span> not that he, whose high places and whose altars Hezekiah hath taken away, and hath said to Judah and
Jerusalem, Ye shall worship before this altar in Jerusalem?
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C18V23">&nbsp;</a>Now therefore, I pray thee, give pledges to my lord the king of Assyria, and I will deliver thee two
thousand horses, if thou be able on thy part to set riders upon them.
 <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C18V24">&nbsp;</a>How then wilt thou turn away the face of one captain of the least of my master’s servants, and put thy
trust on Egypt for chariots and for horsemen?
 <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C18V25">&nbsp;</a>Am I now come up without the LORD against this place to destroy it? The LORD said to me, Go up against
this land, and destroy it.
 <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C18V26">&nbsp;</a>Then said Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, and Shebna, and Joah, unto Rab-shakeh, Speak, I pray thee, to thy
servants in the Syrian language; for we understand
<span class="add">it:</span> and talk not with us in the Jews’ language in the ears of the people that
<span class="add">are</span> on the wall.
 <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C18V27">&nbsp;</a>But Rab-shakeh said unto them, Hath my master sent me to thy master, and to thee, to speak these words?
<span class="add">hath he</span> not
<span class="add">sent me</span> to the men which sit on the wall, that they may eat their own dung, and drink their own piss with you.
 <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C18V28">&nbsp;</a>Then Rab-shakeh stood and cried with a loud voice in the Jews language, and spake, saying, Hear the word
of the great king, the king of Assyria:
 <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C18V29">&nbsp;</a>Thus saith the king, Let not Hezekiah deceive you: for he shall not be able to deliver you out of his
hand:
 <span class="verse"> 30</span><a name="C18V30">&nbsp;</a>Neither let Hezekiah make you trust in the LORD, saying, The LORD will surely deliver us, and this city
shall not be delivered into the hand of the king of Assyria.
 <span class="verse"> 31</span><a name="C18V31">&nbsp;</a>Hearken not to Hezekiah: for thus saith the king of Assyria, Make
<span class="add">an agreement</span> with me by a present, and come out to me, and
<span class="add">then</span> eat ye every man of his own vine, and every one of his fig tree, and drink ye every one the waters of
his cistern:
 <span class="verse"> 32</span><a name="C18V32">&nbsp;</a>Until I come and take you away to a land like your own land, a land of corn and wine, a land of bread
and vineyards, a land of oil olive and of honey, that ye may live, and not die: and hearken not unto
Hezekiah, when he persuadeth you, saying, The LORD will deliver us.
 <span class="verse"> 33</span><a name="C18V33">&nbsp;</a>Hath any of the gods of the nations delivered at all his land out of the hand of the king of Assyria?
 <span class="verse"> 34</span><a name="C18V34">&nbsp;</a>Where
<span class="add">are</span> the gods of Hamath, and of Arpad? where
<span class="add">are
</span> the gods of Sepharvaim, Hena, and Ivah? have they delivered Samaria out of mine hand?
 <span class="verse"> 35</span><a name="C18V35">&nbsp;</a>Who
<span class="add">are</span> they among all the gods of the countries, that have delivered their country out of mine hand, that the
LORD should deliver Jerusalem out of mine hand?
 <span class="verse"> 36</span><a name="C18V36">&nbsp;</a>But the people held their peace, and answered him not a word: for the king’s commandment was, saying,
Answer him not.
 <span class="verse"> 37</span><a name="C18V37">&nbsp;</a>Then came Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, which
<span class="add">was</span> over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah the son of Asaph the recorder, to Hezekiah with
<span class="add">their</span> clothes rent, and told him the words of Rab-shakeh.
