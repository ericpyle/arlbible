<div class="chapterlabel"> 5</div><div class="p">
 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C5V1">&nbsp;</a>Now when the nations round about heard that the altar was built and the sanctuary renewed as before,
it displeased them very much.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C5V2">&nbsp;</a>Wherefore they thought to destroy the generation of Jacob that was among them, and thereupon they began
to slay and destroy the people.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C5V3">&nbsp;</a>Then Judas fought against the children of Esau in Idumea at Arabattine, because they besieged Gael: and
he gave them a great overthrow, and abated their courage, and took their spoils.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C5V4">&nbsp;</a>Also he remembered the injury of the children of Bean, who had been a snare and an offence unto the people,
in that they lay in wait for them in the ways.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C5V5">&nbsp;</a>He shut them up therefore in the towers, and encamped against them, and destroyed them utterly, and burned
the towers of that place with fire, and all that were therein.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C5V6">&nbsp;</a>Afterward he passed over to the children of Ammon, where he found a mighty power, and much people, with
Timotheus their captain.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C5V7">&nbsp;</a>So he fought many battles with them, till at length they were discomfited before him; and he smote them.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C5V8">&nbsp;</a>And when he had taken Jazar, with the towns belonging thereto, he returned into Judea.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C5V9">&nbsp;</a>Then the heathen that were at Galaad assembled themselves together against the Israelites that were in
their quarters, to destroy them; but they fled to the fortress of Dathema.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C5V10">&nbsp;</a>And sent letters unto Judas and his brethren, The heathen that are round about us are assembled together
against us to destroy us:
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C5V11">&nbsp;</a>And they are preparing to come and take the fortress whereunto we are fled, Timotheus being captain of
their host.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C5V12">&nbsp;</a>Come now therefore, and deliver us from their hands, for many of us are slain:
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C5V13">&nbsp;</a>Yea, all our brethren that were in the places of Tobie are put to death: their wives and their children
also they have carried away captives, and borne away their stuff; and they have destroyed there about
a thousand men.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C5V14">&nbsp;</a>While these letters were yet reading, behold, there came other messengers from Galilee with their clothes
rent, who reported on this wise,
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C5V15">&nbsp;</a>And said, They of Ptolemais, and of Tyrus, and Sidon, and all Galilee of the Gentiles, are assembled
together against us to consume us.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C5V16">&nbsp;</a>Now when Judas and the people heard these words, there assembled a great congregation together, to consult
what they should do for their brethren, that were in trouble, and assaulted of them.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C5V17">&nbsp;</a>Then said Judas unto Simon his brother, Choose thee out men, and go and deliver thy brethren that are
in Galilee, for I and Jonathan my brother will go into the country of Galaad.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C5V18">&nbsp;</a>So he left Joseph the son of Zacharias, and Azarias, captains of the people, with the remnant of the
host in Judea to keep it.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C5V19">&nbsp;</a>Unto whom he gave commandment, saying, Take ye the charge of this people, and see that ye make not war
against the heathen until the time that we come again.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C5V20">&nbsp;</a>Now unto Simon were given three thousand men to go into Galilee, and unto Judas eight thousand men for
the country of Galaad.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C5V21">&nbsp;</a>Then went Simon into Galilee, where he fought many battles with the heathen, so that the heathen were
discomfited by him.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C5V22">&nbsp;</a>And he pursued them unto the gate of Ptolemais; and there were slain of the heathen about three thousand
men, whose spoils he took.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C5V23">&nbsp;</a>And those that were in Galilee, and in Arbattis, with their wives and their children, and all that they
had, took he away with him, and brought them into Judea with great joy.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C5V24">&nbsp;</a>Judas Maccabeus also and his brother Jonathan went over Jordan, and travelled three days’ journey in
the wilderness,
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C5V25">&nbsp;</a>Where they met with the Nabathites, who came unto them in a peaceable manner, and told them every thing
that had happened to their brethren in the land of Galaad:
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C5V26">&nbsp;</a>And how that many of them were shut up in Bosora, and Bosor, and Alema, Casphor, Maked, and Carnaim;
all these cities are strong and great:
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C5V27">&nbsp;</a>And that they were shut up in the rest of the cities of the country of Galaad, and that against to morrow
they had appointed to bring their host against the forts, and to take them, and to destroy them all in
one day.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C5V28">&nbsp;</a>Hereupon Judas and his host turned suddenly by the way of the wilderness unto Bosora; and when he had
won the city, he slew all the males with the edge of the sword, and took all their spoils, and burned
the city with fire,
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C5V29">&nbsp;</a>From whence he removed by night, and went till he came to the fortress.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 30</span><a name="C5V30">&nbsp;</a>And betimes in the morning they looked up, and, behold, there was an innumerable people bearing ladders
and other engines of war, to take the fortress: for they assaulted them.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 31</span><a name="C5V31">&nbsp;</a>When Judas therefore saw that the battle was begun, and that the cry of the city went up to heaven, with
trumpets, and a great sound,
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 32</span><a name="C5V32">&nbsp;</a>He said unto his host, Fight this day for your brethren.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 33</span><a name="C5V33">&nbsp;</a>So he went forth behind them in three companies, who sounded their trumpets, and cried with prayer.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 34</span><a name="C5V34">&nbsp;</a>Then the host of Timotheus, knowing that it was Maccabeus, fled from him: wherefore he smote them with
a great slaughter; so that there were killed of them that day about eight thousand men.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 35</span><a name="C5V35">&nbsp;</a>This done, Judas turned aside to Maspha; and after he had assaulted it he took and slew all the males
therein, and received the spoils thereof and and burnt it with fire.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 36</span><a name="C5V36">&nbsp;</a>From thence went he, and took Casphon, Maged, Bosor, and the other cities of the country of Galaad.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 37</span><a name="C5V37">&nbsp;</a>After these things gathered Timotheus another host and encamped against Raphon beyond the brook.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 38</span><a name="C5V38">&nbsp;</a>So Judas sent men to espy the host, who brought him word, saying, All the heathen that be round about
us are assembled unto them, even a very great host.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 39</span><a name="C5V39">&nbsp;</a>He hath also hired the Arabians to help them and they have pitched their tents beyond the brook, ready
to come and fight against thee. Upon this Judas went to meet them.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 40</span><a name="C5V40">&nbsp;</a>Then Timotheus said unto the captains of his host, When Judas and his host come near the brook, if he
pass over first unto us, we shall not be able to withstand him; for he will mightily prevail against
us:
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 41</span><a name="C5V41">&nbsp;</a>But if he be afraid, and camp beyond the river, we shall go over unto him, and prevail against him.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 42</span><a name="C5V42">&nbsp;</a>Now when Judas came near the brook, he caused the scribes of the people to remain by the brook: unto
whom he gave commandment, saying, Suffer no man to remain in the camp, but let all come to the battle.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 43</span><a name="C5V43">&nbsp;</a>So he went first over unto them, and all the people after him: then all the heathen, being discomfited
before him, cast away their weapons, and fled unto the temple that was at Carnaim.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 44</span><a name="C5V44">&nbsp;</a>But they took the city, and burned the temple with all that were therein. Thus was Carnaim subdued, neither
could they stand any longer before Judas.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 45</span><a name="C5V45">&nbsp;</a>Then Judas gathered together all the Israelites that were in the country of Galaad, from the least unto
the greatest, even their wives, and their children, and their stuff, a very great host, to the end they
might come into the land of Judea.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 46</span><a name="C5V46">&nbsp;</a>Now when they came unto Ephron, (this was a great city in the way as they should go, very well fortified)
they could not turn from it, either on the right hand or the left, but must needs pass through the midst
of it.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 47</span><a name="C5V47">&nbsp;</a>Then they of the city shut them out, and stopped up the gates with stones.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 48</span><a name="C5V48">&nbsp;</a>Whereupon Judas sent unto them in peaceable manner, saying, Let us pass through your land to go into
our own country, and none shall do you any hurt; we will only pass through on foot: howbeit they would
not open unto him.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 49</span><a name="C5V49">&nbsp;</a>Wherefore Judas commanded a proclamation to be made throughout the host, that every man should pitch
his tent in the place where he was.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 50</span><a name="C5V50">&nbsp;</a>So the soldiers pitched, and assaulted the city all that day and all that night, till at the length the
city was delivered into his hands:
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 51</span><a name="C5V51">&nbsp;</a>Who then slew all the males with the edge of the sword, and rased the city, and took the spoils thereof,
and passed through the city over them that were slain.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 52</span><a name="C5V52">&nbsp;</a>After this went they over Jordan into the great plain before Bethsan.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 53</span><a name="C5V53">&nbsp;</a>And Judas gathered together those that came behind, and exhorted the people all the way through, till
they came into the land of Judea.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 54</span><a name="C5V54">&nbsp;</a>So they went up to mount Sion with joy and gladness, where they offered burnt offerings, because not
one of them were slain until they had returned in peace.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 55</span><a name="C5V55">&nbsp;</a>Now what time as Judas and Jonathan were in the land of Galaad, and Simon his brother in Galilee before
Ptolemais,
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 56</span><a name="C5V56">&nbsp;</a>Joseph the son of Zacharias, and Azarias, captains of the garrisons, heard of the valiant acts and warlike
deeds which they had done.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 57</span><a name="C5V57">&nbsp;</a>Wherefore they said, Let us also get us a name, and go fight against the heathen that are round about
us.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 58</span><a name="C5V58">&nbsp;</a>So when they had given charge unto the garrison that was with them, they went toward Jamnia.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 59</span><a name="C5V59">&nbsp;</a>Then came Gorgias and his men out of the city to fight against them.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 60</span><a name="C5V60">&nbsp;</a>And so it was, that Joseph and Azaras were put to flight, and pursued unto the borders of Judea: and
there were slain that day of the people of Israel about two thousand men.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 61</span><a name="C5V61">&nbsp;</a>Thus was there a great overthrow among the children of Israel, because they were not obedient unto Judas
and his brethren, but thought to do some valiant act.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 62</span><a name="C5V62">&nbsp;</a>Moreover these men came not of the seed of those, by whose hand deliverance was given unto Israel.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 63</span><a name="C5V63">&nbsp;</a>Howbeit the man Judas and his brethren were greatly renowned in the sight of all Israel, and of all the
heathen, wheresoever their name was heard of;
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 64</span><a name="C5V64">&nbsp;</a>Insomuch as the the people assembled unto them with joyful acclamations.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 65</span><a name="C5V65">&nbsp;</a>Afterward went Judas forth with his brethren, and fought against the children of Esau in the land toward
the south, where he smote Hebron, and the towns thereof, and pulled down the fortress of it, and burned
the towers thereof round about.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 66</span><a name="C5V66">&nbsp;</a>From thence he removed to go into the land of the Philistines, and passed through Samaria.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 67</span><a name="C5V67">&nbsp;</a>At that time certain priests, desirous to shew their valour, were slain in battle, for that they went
out to fight unadvisedly.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 68</span><a name="C5V68">&nbsp;</a>So Judas turned to Azotus in the land of the Philistines, and when he had pulled down their altars, and
burned their carved images with fire, and spoiled their cities, he returned into the land of Judea.
