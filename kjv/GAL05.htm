 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C5V1">&nbsp;</a>Stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free, and be not entangled again with
the yoke of bondage.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C5V2">&nbsp;</a>Behold, I Paul say unto you, that if ye be circumcised, Christ shall profit you nothing.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C5V3">&nbsp;</a>For I testify again to every man that is circumcised, that he is a debtor to do the whole law.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C5V4">&nbsp;</a>Christ is become of no effect unto you, whosoever of you are justified by the law; ye are fallen from
grace.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C5V5">&nbsp;</a>For we through the Spirit wait for the hope of righteousness by faith.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C5V6">&nbsp;</a>For in Jesus Christ neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision; but faith which worketh
by love.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C5V7">&nbsp;</a>Ye did run well; who did hinder you that ye should not obey the truth?
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C5V8">&nbsp;</a>This persuasion
<span class="add">cometh</span> not of him that calleth you.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C5V9">&nbsp;</a>A little leaven leaveneth the whole lump.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C5V10">&nbsp;</a>I have confidence in you through the Lord, that ye will be none otherwise minded: but he that troubleth
you shall bear his judgment, whosoever he be.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C5V11">&nbsp;</a>And I, brethren, if I yet preach circumcision, why do I yet suffer persecution? then is the offence of
the cross ceased.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C5V12">&nbsp;</a>I would they were even cut off which trouble you.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C5V13">&nbsp;</a>For, brethren, ye have been called unto liberty; only
<span class="add">use</span> not liberty for an occasion to the flesh, but by love serve one another.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C5V14">&nbsp;</a>For all the law is fulfilled in one word,
<span class="add">even</span> in this; Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C5V15">&nbsp;</a>But if ye bite and devour one another, take heed that ye be not consumed one of another.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C5V16">&nbsp;</a><span class="add">This</span> I say then, Walk in the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfil the lust of the flesh.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C5V17">&nbsp;</a>For the flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh: and these are contrary the
one to the other: so that ye cannot do the things that ye would.
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C5V18">&nbsp;</a>But if ye be led of the Spirit, ye are not under the law.
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C5V19">&nbsp;</a>Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are
<span class="add">these;</span> Adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness,
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C5V20">&nbsp;</a>Idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance, emulations, wrath, strife, seditions, heresies,
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C5V21">&nbsp;</a>Envyings, murders, drunkenness, revellings, and such like: of the which I tell you before, as I have
also told
<span class="add">you</span> in time past, that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God.
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C5V22">&nbsp;</a>But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith,
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C5V23">&nbsp;</a>Meekness, temperance: against such there is no law.
 <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C5V24">&nbsp;</a>And they that are Christ’s have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts.
 <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C5V25">&nbsp;</a>If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit.
 <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C5V26">&nbsp;</a>Let us not be desirous of vain glory, provoking one another, envying one another.
