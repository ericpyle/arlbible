 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C8V1">&nbsp;</a>And God remembered Noah, and every living thing, and all the cattle that
<span class="add">was</span> with him in the ark: and God made a wind to pass over the earth, and the waters asswaged;
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C8V2">&nbsp;</a>The fountains also of the deep and the windows of heaven were stopped, and the rain from heaven was restrained;
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C8V3">&nbsp;</a>And the waters returned from off the earth continually: and after the end of the hundred and fifty days
the waters were abated.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C8V4">&nbsp;</a>And the ark rested in the seventh month, on the seventeenth day of the month, upon the mountains of Ararat.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C8V5">&nbsp;</a>And the waters decreased continually until the tenth month: in the tenth
<span class="add">month,</span> on the first
<span class="add">day</span> of the month, were the tops of the mountains seen.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C8V6">&nbsp;</a>And it came to pass at the end of forty days, that Noah opened the window of the ark which he had made:
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C8V7">&nbsp;</a>And he sent forth a raven, which went forth to and fro, until the waters were dried up from off the earth.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C8V8">&nbsp;</a>Also he sent forth a dove from him, to see if the waters were abated from off the face of the ground;
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C8V9">&nbsp;</a>But the dove found no rest for the sole of her foot, and she returned unto him into the ark, for the
waters
<span class="add">were</span> on the face of the whole earth: then he put forth his hand, and took her, and pulled her in unto him
into the ark.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C8V10">&nbsp;</a>And he stayed yet other seven days; and again he sent forth the dove out of the ark;
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C8V11">&nbsp;</a>And the dove came in to him in the evening; and, lo, in her mouth
<span class="add">was</span> an olive leaf pluckt off: so Noah knew that the waters were abated from off the earth.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C8V12">&nbsp;</a>And he stayed yet other seven days; and sent forth the dove; which returned not again unto him any more.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C8V13">&nbsp;</a>And it came to pass in the six hundredth and first year, in the first
<span class="add">month,</span> the first
<span class="add">day</span> of the month, the waters were dried up from off the earth: and Noah removed the covering of the ark,
and looked, and, behold, the face of the ground was dry.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C8V14">&nbsp;</a>And in the second month, on the seven and twentieth day of the month, was the earth dried.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C8V15">&nbsp;</a>And God spake unto Noah, saying,
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C8V16">&nbsp;</a>Go forth of the ark, thou, and thy wife, and thy sons, and thy sons’ wives with thee.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C8V17">&nbsp;</a>Bring forth with thee every living thing that
<span class="add">is</span> with thee, of all flesh,
<span class="add">both</span> of fowl, and of cattle, and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth; that they may breed
abundantly in the earth, and be fruitful, and multiply upon the earth.
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C8V18">&nbsp;</a>And Noah went forth, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons’ wives with him:
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C8V19">&nbsp;</a>Every beast, every creeping thing, and every fowl,
<span class="add">and</span> whatsoever creepeth upon the earth, after their kinds, went forth out of the ark.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C8V20">&nbsp;</a>And Noah builded an altar unto the LORD; and took of every clean beast, and of every clean fowl, and
offered burnt offerings on the altar.
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C8V21">&nbsp;</a>And the LORD smelled a sweet savour; and the LORD said in his heart, I will not again curse the ground
any more for man’s sake; for the imagination of man’s heart
<span class="add">is</span> evil from his youth; neither will I again smite any more every thing living, as I have done.
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C8V22">&nbsp;</a>While the earth remaineth, seedtime and harvest, and cold and heat, and summer and winter, and day and
night shall not cease.
