 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C24V1">&nbsp;</a>Now upon the first
<span class="add">day</span> of the week, very early in the morning, they came unto the sepulchre, bringing the spices which they
had prepared, and certain
<span class="add">others</span> with them.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C24V2">&nbsp;</a>And they found the stone rolled away from the sepulchre.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C24V3">&nbsp;</a>And they entered in, and found not the body of the Lord Jesus.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C24V4">&nbsp;</a>And it came to pass, as they were much perplexed thereabout, behold, two men stood by them in shining
garments:
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C24V5">&nbsp;</a>And as they were afraid, and bowed down
<span class="add">their</span> faces to the earth, they said unto them, Why seek ye the living among the dead?
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C24V6">&nbsp;</a>He is not here, but is risen: remember how he spake unto you when he was yet in Galilee,
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C24V7">&nbsp;</a>Saying,
<span class="wj">The Son of man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men, and be crucified, and the third day rise
again.
</span> <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C24V8">&nbsp;</a>And they remembered his words,
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C24V9">&nbsp;</a>And returned from the sepulchre, and told all these things unto the eleven, and to all the rest.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C24V10">&nbsp;</a>It was Mary Magdalene, and Joanna, and Mary
<span class="add">the mother</span> of James, and other
<span class="add">women that were</span> with them, which told these things unto the apostles.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C24V11">&nbsp;</a>And their words seemed to them as idle tales, and they believed them not.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C24V12">&nbsp;</a>Then arose Peter, and ran unto the sepulchre; and stooping down, he beheld the linen clothes laid by
themselves, and departed, wondering in himself at that which was come to pass.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C24V13">&nbsp;</a>And, behold, two of them went that same day to a village called Emmaus, which was from Jerusalem
<span class="add">about</span> threescore furlongs.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C24V14">&nbsp;</a>And they talked together of all these things which had happened.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C24V15">&nbsp;</a>And it came to pass, that, while they communed
<span class="add">together</span> and reasoned, Jesus himself drew near, and went with them.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C24V16">&nbsp;</a>But their eyes were holden that they should not know him.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C24V17">&nbsp;</a>And he said unto them,
<span class="wj">What manner of communications
</span><span class="add">are
</span><span class="wj"> these that ye have one to another, as ye walk, and are sad?
</span> <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C24V18">&nbsp;</a>And the one of them, whose name was Cleopas, answering said unto him, Art thou only a stranger in Jerusalem,
and hast not known the things which are come to pass there in these days?
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C24V19">&nbsp;</a>And he said unto them,
<span class="wj">What things?</span> And they said unto him, Concerning Jesus of Nazareth, which was a prophet mighty in deed and word before
God and all the people:
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C24V20">&nbsp;</a>And how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him to be condemned to death, and have crucified him.
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C24V21">&nbsp;</a>But we trusted that it had been he which should have redeemed Israel: and beside all this, to day is
the third day since these things were done.
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C24V22">&nbsp;</a>Yea, and certain women also of our company made us astonished, which were early at the sepulchre;
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C24V23">&nbsp;</a>And when they found not his body, they came, saying, that they had also seen a vision of angels, which
said that he was alive.
 <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C24V24">&nbsp;</a>And certain of them which were with us went to the sepulchre, and found
<span class="add">it</span> even so as the women had said: but him they saw not.
 <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C24V25">&nbsp;</a>Then he said unto them,
<span class="wj">O fools, and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken:
</span> <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C24V26">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Ought not Christ to have suffered these things, and to enter into his glory?
</span> <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C24V27">&nbsp;</a>And beginning at Moses and all the prophets, he expounded unto them in all the scriptures the things
concerning himself.
 <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C24V28">&nbsp;</a>And they drew nigh unto the village, whither they went: and he made as though he would have gone further.
 <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C24V29">&nbsp;</a>But they constrained him, saying, Abide with us: for it is toward evening, and the day is far spent.
And he went in to tarry with them.
 <span class="verse"> 30</span><a name="C24V30">&nbsp;</a>And it came to pass, as he sat at meat with them, he took bread, and blessed
<span class="add">it,</span> and brake, and gave to them.
 <span class="verse"> 31</span><a name="C24V31">&nbsp;</a>And their eyes were opened, and they knew him; and he vanished out of their sight.
 <span class="verse"> 32</span><a name="C24V32">&nbsp;</a>And they said one to another, Did not our heart burn within us, while he talked with us by the way, and
while he opened to us the scriptures?
 <span class="verse"> 33</span><a name="C24V33">&nbsp;</a>And they rose up the same hour, and returned to Jerusalem, and found the eleven gathered together, and
them that were with them,
 <span class="verse"> 34</span><a name="C24V34">&nbsp;</a>Saying, The Lord is risen indeed, and hath appeared to Simon.
 <span class="verse"> 35</span><a name="C24V35">&nbsp;</a>And they told what things
<span class="add">were done</span> in the way, and how he was known of them in breaking of bread.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 36</span><a name="C24V36">&nbsp;</a>And as they thus spake, Jesus himself stood in the midst of them, and saith unto them,
<span class="wj">Peace
</span><span class="add">be</span><span class="wj"> unto you.
</span> <span class="verse"> 37</span><a name="C24V37">&nbsp;</a>But they were terrified and affrighted, and supposed that they had seen a spirit.
 <span class="verse"> 38</span><a name="C24V38">&nbsp;</a>And he said unto them,
<span class="wj">Why are ye troubled? and why do thoughts arise in your hearts?
</span> <span class="verse"> 39</span><a name="C24V39">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Behold my hands and my feet, that it is I myself: handle me, and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and
bones, as ye see me have.
</span> <span class="verse"> 40</span><a name="C24V40">&nbsp;</a>And when he had thus spoken, he shewed them
<span class="add">his</span> hands and
<span class="add">his</span> feet.
 <span class="verse"> 41</span><a name="C24V41">&nbsp;</a>And while they yet believed not for joy, and wondered, he said unto them,
<span class="wj">Have ye here any meat?
</span> <span class="verse"> 42</span><a name="C24V42">&nbsp;</a>And they gave him a piece of a broiled fish, and of an honeycomb.
 <span class="verse"> 43</span><a name="C24V43">&nbsp;</a>And he took
<span class="add">it,</span> and did eat before them.
 <span class="verse"> 44</span><a name="C24V44">&nbsp;</a>And he said unto them,
<span class="wj">These
</span><span class="add">are</span><span class="wj"> the words which I spake unto you, while I was yet with you, that all things must be fulfilled, which
were written in the law of Moses, and
</span><span class="add">in</span><span class="wj"> the prophets, and
</span><span class="add">in</span><span class="wj"> the psalms, concerning me.
</span> <span class="verse"> 45</span><a name="C24V45">&nbsp;</a>Then opened he their understanding, that they might understand the scriptures,
 <span class="verse"> 46</span><a name="C24V46">&nbsp;</a>And said unto them,
<span class="wj">Thus it is written, and thus it behoved Christ to suffer, and to rise from the dead the third day:
</span> <span class="verse"> 47</span><a name="C24V47">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations, beginning
at Jerusalem.
</span> <span class="verse"> 48</span><a name="C24V48">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And ye are witnesses of these things.</span></div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 49</span><a name="C24V49">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And, behold, I send the promise of my Father upon you: but tarry ye in the city of Jerusalem, until ye
be endued with power from on high.
</span></div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 50</span><a name="C24V50">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And he led them out as far as to Bethany, and he lifted up his hands, and blessed them.
</span> <span class="verse"> 51</span><a name="C24V51">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And it came to pass, while he blessed them, he was parted from them, and carried up into heaven.
</span> <span class="verse"> 52</span><a name="C24V52">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And they worshipped him, and returned to Jerusalem with great joy:
</span> <span class="verse"> 53</span><a name="C24V53">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And were continually in the temple, praising and blessing God. Amen.
