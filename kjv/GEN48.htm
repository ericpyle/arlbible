 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C48V1">&nbsp;</a>And it came to pass after these things, that
<span class="add">one</span> told Joseph, Behold, thy father
<span class="add">is</span> sick: and he took with him his two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C48V2">&nbsp;</a>And
<span class="add">one</span> told Jacob, and said, Behold, thy son Joseph cometh unto thee: and Israel strengthened himself, and
sat upon the bed.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C48V3">&nbsp;</a>And Jacob said unto Joseph, God Almighty appeared unto me at Luz in the land of Canaan, and blessed me,
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C48V4">&nbsp;</a>And said unto me, Behold, I will make thee fruitful, and multiply thee, and I will make of thee a multitude
of people; and will give this land to thy seed after thee
<span class="add">for</span> an everlasting possession.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C48V5">&nbsp;</a>And now thy two sons, Ephraim and Manasseh, which were born unto thee in the land of Egypt before I came
unto thee into Egypt,
<span class="add">are</span> mine; as Reuben and Simeon, they shall be mine.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C48V6">&nbsp;</a>And thy issue, which thou begettest after them, shall be thine,
<span class="add">and</span> shall be called after the name of their brethren in their inheritance.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C48V7">&nbsp;</a>And as for me, when I came from Padan, Rachel died by me in the land of Canaan in the way, when yet
<span class="add">there was</span> but a little way to come unto Ephrath: and I buried her there in the way of Ephrath; the same is Bethlehem.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C48V8">&nbsp;</a>And Israel beheld Joseph’s sons, and said, Who
<span class="add">are</span> these?
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C48V9">&nbsp;</a>And Joseph said unto his father, They
<span class="add">are</span> my sons, whom God hath given me in this
<span class="add">place.</span> And he said, Bring them, I pray thee, unto me, and I will bless them.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C48V10">&nbsp;</a>Now the eyes of Israel were dim for age,
<span class="add">so that</span> he could not see. And he brought them near unto him; and he kissed them, and embraced them.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C48V11">&nbsp;</a>And Israel said unto Joseph, I had not thought to see thy face: and, lo, God hath shewed me also thy
seed.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C48V12">&nbsp;</a>And Joseph brought them out from between his knees, and he bowed himself with his face to the earth.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C48V13">&nbsp;</a>And Joseph took them both, Ephraim in his right hand toward Israel’s left hand, and Manasseh in his left
hand toward Israel’s right hand, and brought
<span class="add">them</span> near unto him.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C48V14">&nbsp;</a>And Israel stretched out his right hand, and laid it upon Ephraim’s head, who
<span class="add">was</span> the younger, and his left hand upon Manasseh’s head, guiding his hands wittingly; for Manasseh
<span class="add">was</span> the firstborn.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C48V15">&nbsp;</a>And he blessed Joseph, and said, God, before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac did walk, the God which
fed me all my life long unto this day,
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C48V16">&nbsp;</a>The Angel which redeemed me from all evil, bless the lads; and let my name be named on them, and the
name of my fathers Abraham and Isaac; and let them grow into a multitude in the midst of the earth.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C48V17">&nbsp;</a>And when Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand upon the head of Ephraim, it displeased him:
and he held up his father’s hand, to remove it from Ephraim’s head unto Manasseh’s head.
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C48V18">&nbsp;</a>And Joseph said unto his father, Not so, my father: for this
<span class="add">is
</span> the firstborn; put thy right hand upon his head.
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C48V19">&nbsp;</a>And his father refused, and said, I know
<span class="add">it,</span> my son, I know
<span class="add">it:</span> he also shall become a people, and he also shall be great: but truly his younger brother shall be greater
than he, and his seed shall become a multitude of nations.
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C48V20">&nbsp;</a>And he blessed them that day, saying, In thee shall Israel bless, saying, God make thee as Ephraim and
as Manasseh: and he set Ephraim before Manasseh.
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C48V21">&nbsp;</a>And Israel said unto Joseph, Behold, I die: but God shall be with you, and bring you again unto the land
of your fathers.
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C48V22">&nbsp;</a>Moreover I have given to thee one portion above thy brethren, which I took out of the hand of the Amorite
with my sword and with my bow.
