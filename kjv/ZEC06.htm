 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C6V1">&nbsp;</a>And I turned, and lifted up mine eyes, and looked, and, behold, there came four chariots out from between
two mountains; and the mountains
<span class="add">were</span> mountains of brass.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C6V2">&nbsp;</a>In the first chariot
<span class="add">were</span> red horses; and in the second chariot black horses;
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C6V3">&nbsp;</a>And in the third chariot white horses; and in the fourth chariot grisled and bay horses.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C6V4">&nbsp;</a>Then I answered and said unto the angel that talked with me, What
<span class="add">are</span> these, my lord?
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C6V5">&nbsp;</a>And the angel answered and said unto me, These
<span class="add">are</span> the four spirits of the heavens, which go forth from standing before the Lord of all the earth.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C6V6">&nbsp;</a>The black horses which
<span class="add">are</span> therein go forth into the north country; and the white go forth after them; and the grisled go forth
toward the south country.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C6V7">&nbsp;</a>And the bay went forth, and sought to go that they might walk to and fro through the earth: and he said,
Get you hence, walk to and fro through the earth. So they walked to and fro through the earth.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C6V8">&nbsp;</a>Then cried he upon me, and spake unto me, saying, Behold, these that go toward the north country have
quieted my spirit in the north country.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C6V9">&nbsp;</a>And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C6V10">&nbsp;</a>Take of
<span class="add">them of</span> the captivity,
<span class="add">even</span> of Heldai, of Tobijah, and of Jedaiah, which are come from Babylon, and come thou the same day, and
go into the house of Josiah the son of Zephaniah;
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C6V11">&nbsp;</a>Then take silver and gold, and make crowns, and set
<span class="add">them</span> upon the head of Joshua the son of Josedech, the high priest;
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C6V12">&nbsp;</a>And speak unto him, saying, Thus speaketh the LORD of hosts, saying, Behold the man whose name
<span class="add">is</span> The BRANCH; and he shall grow up out of his place, and he shall build the temple of the LORD:
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C6V13">&nbsp;</a>Even he shall build the temple of the LORD; and he shall bear the glory, and shall sit and rule upon
his throne; and he shall be a priest upon his throne: and the counsel of peace shall be between them
both.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C6V14">&nbsp;</a>And the crowns shall be to Helem, and to Tobijah, and to Jedaiah, and to Hen the son of Zephaniah, for
a memorial in the temple of the LORD.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C6V15">&nbsp;</a>And they
<span class="add">that are</span> far off shall come and build in the temple of the LORD, and ye shall know that the LORD of hosts hath
sent me unto you. And
<span class="add">this</span> shall come to pass, if ye will diligently obey the voice of the LORD your God.
