 <span class="verse" id="V1">1&nbsp;</span>And I turned, and lifted up mine eyes, and looked, and, behold, there came four chariots out from between two mountains; and the mountains <span class='add'>were</span> mountains of brass.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span>In the first chariot <span class='add'>were</span> red horses; and in the second chariot black horses;  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>And in the third chariot white horses; and in the fourth chariot grisled and bay horses.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>Then I answered and said unto the angel that talked with me, What <span class='add'>are</span> these, my lord?  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>And the angel answered and said unto me, These <span class='add'>are</span> the four spirits of the heavens, which go forth from standing before the Lord of all the earth.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>The black horses which <span class='add'>are</span> therein go forth into the north country; and the white go forth after them; and the grisled go forth toward the south country.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>And the bay went forth, and sought to go that they might walk to and fro through the earth: and he said, Get you hence, walk to and fro through the earth. So they walked to and fro through the earth.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>Then cried he upon me, and spake unto me, saying, Behold, these that go toward the north country have quieted my spirit in the north country. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>Take of <span class='add'>them of</span> the captivity, <span class='add'>even</span> of Heldai, of Tobijah, and of Jedaiah, which are come from Babylon, and come thou the same day, and go into the house of Josiah the son of Zephaniah;  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>Then take silver and gold, and make crowns, and set <span class='add'>them</span> upon the head of Joshua the son of Josedech, the high priest;  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>And speak unto him, saying, Thus speaketh the LORD of hosts, saying, Behold the man whose name <span class='add'>is</span> The BRANCH; and he shall grow up out of his place, and he shall build the temple of the LORD:  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>Even he shall build the temple of the LORD; and he shall bear the glory, and shall sit and rule upon his throne; and he shall be a priest upon his throne: and the counsel of peace shall be between them both.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>And the crowns shall be to Helem, and to Tobijah, and to Jedaiah, and to Hen the son of Zephaniah, for a memorial in the temple of the LORD.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>And they <span class='add'>that are</span> far off shall come and build in the temple of the LORD, and ye shall know that the LORD of hosts hath sent me unto you. And <span class='add'>this</span> shall come to pass, if ye will diligently obey the voice of the LORD your God. </div><ul class='tnav'>
