because thou hearkenedst not unto the voice of the LORD thy God, to keep his commandments and his statutes which he commanded thee:  <span class="verse" id="V46">46&nbsp;</span>And they shall be upon thee for a sign and for a wonder, and upon thy seed for ever.  <span class="verse" id="V47">47&nbsp;</span>Because thou servedst not the LORD thy God with joyfulness, and with gladness of heart, for the abundance of all <span class='add'>things;</span>  <span class="verse" id="V48">48&nbsp;</span>Therefore shalt thou serve thine enemies which the LORD shall send against thee, in hunger, and in thirst, and in nakedness, and in want of all <span class='add'>things:</span> and he shall put a yoke of iron upon thy neck, until he have destroyed thee.  <span class="verse" id="V49">49&nbsp;</span>The LORD shall bring a nation against thee from far, from the end of the earth, <span class='add'>as swift</span> as the eagle flieth;

 <span class="verse" id="V59">59&nbsp;</span>Then the LORD will make thy plagues wonderful, and the plagues of thy seed, <span class='add'>even</span> great plagues, and of long continuance, and sore sicknesses, and of long continuance.  <span class="verse" id="V60">60&nbsp;</span>Moreover he will bring upon thee all the diseases of Egypt, which thou wast afraid of; and they shall cleave unto thee.  <span class="verse" id="V61">61&nbsp;</span>Also every sickness, and every plague, which <span class='add'>is</span> not written in the book of this law, them will the LORD bring upon thee, until thou be destroyed.  <span class="verse" id="V62">62&nbsp;</span>And ye shall be left few in number, whereas ye were as the stars of heaven for multitude; because thou wouldest not obey the voice of the LORD thy God.  <span class="verse" id="V63">63&nbsp;</span>And it shall come to pass, <span class='add'>that</span> as the LORD rejoiced over you to do you good, and to multiply you; so the LORD will rejoice over you to destroy you, and to bring you to nought; and ye shall be plucked from off the land whither thou goest to possess it.  <span class="verse" id="V64">64&nbsp;</span>And the LORD shall scatter thee among all people, from the one end of the earth even unto the other; and there thou shalt serve other gods, which neither thou nor thy fathers have known, <span class='add'>even</span> wood and stone.  <span class="verse" id="V65">65&nbsp;</span>And among these nations shalt thou find no ease, neither shall the sole of thy foot have rest: but the LORD shall give thee there a trembling heart, and failing of eyes, and sorrow of mind:  <span class="verse" id="V66">66&nbsp;</span>And thy life shall hang in doubt before thee; and thou shalt fear day and night, and shalt have none assurance of thy life:  <span class="verse" id="V67">67&nbsp;</span>In the morning thou shalt say, Would God it were even! and at even thou shalt say, Would God it were morning! for the fear of thine heart wherewith thou shalt fear, and for the sight of thine eyes which thou shalt see.  <span class="verse" id="V68">68&nbsp;</span>And the LORD shall bring thee into Egypt again with ships, by the way whereof I spake unto thee, Thou shalt see it no more again: and there ye shall be sold unto your enemies for bondmen and bondwomen, and no man shall buy <span class='add'>you</span>. </div><ul class='tnav'>
