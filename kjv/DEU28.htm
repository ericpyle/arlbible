ways: and thou shalt be only oppressed and spoiled evermore, and no man shall save

</span> <span class="verse"> 30</span><a name="C28V30">&nbsp;</a>Thou shalt betroth a wife, and another man shall lie with her: thou shalt build an house, and thou shalt
not dwell therein: thou shalt plant a vineyard, and shalt not gather the grapes thereof.

the sole of thy foot unto the top of thy head.
 <span class="verse"> 36</span><a name="C28V36">&nbsp;</a>The LORD shall bring thee, and thy king which thou shalt set over thee, unto a nation which neither thou
nor thy fathers have known; and there shalt thou serve other gods, wood and stone.

lead thee.

 <span class="verse"> 40</span><a name="C28V40">&nbsp;</a>Thou shalt have olive trees throughout all thy coasts, but thou shalt not anoint
<span class="add">thyself</span> with the oil; for thine olive shall cast
<span class="add">his fruit.

 <span class="verse"> 45</span><a name="C28V45">&nbsp;</a>Moreover all these curses shall come upon thee, and shall pursue thee, and overtake thee, till thou be
destroyed; because thou hearkenedst not unto the voice of the LORD thy God, to keep his commandments
and his statutes which he commanded thee:
 <span class="verse"> 46</span><a name="C28V46">&nbsp;</a>And they shall be upon thee for a sign and for a wonder, and upon thy seed for ever.
 <span class="verse"> 47</span><a name="C28V47">&nbsp;</a>Because thou servedst not the LORD thy God with joyfulness, and with gladness of heart, for the abundance
of all
<span class="add">things;
</span> <span class="verse"> 48</span><a name="C28V48">&nbsp;</a>Therefore shalt thou serve thine enemies which the LORD shall send against thee, in hunger, and in thirst,
and in nakedness, and in want of all
<span class="add">things:</span> and he shall put a yoke of iron upon thy neck, until he have destroyed thee.
 <span class="verse"> 49</span><a name="C28V49">&nbsp;</a>The LORD shall bring a nation against thee from far, from the end of the earth,
<span class="add">as swift</span> as the eagle flieth; a nation whose tongue thou shalt not understand;
 <span class="verse"> 50</span><a name="C28V50">&nbsp;</a>A nation of fierce countenance, which shall not regard the person of the old, nor shew favour to the
young:
 <span class="verse"> 51</span><a name="C28V51">&nbsp;</a>And he shall eat the fruit of thy cattle, and the fruit of thy land, until thou be destroyed: which
<span class="add">also</span> shall not leave thee
<span class="add">either</span> corn, wine, or oil,
<span class="add">or</span> the increase of thy kine, or flocks of thy sheep, until he have destroyed thee.
 <span class="verse"> 52</span><a name="C28V52">&nbsp;</a>And he shall besiege thee in all thy gates, until thy high and fenced walls come down, wherein thou trustedst,
throughout all thy land: and he shall besiege thee in all thy gates throughout all thy land, which the
LORD thy God hath given thee.
 <span class="verse"> 53</span><a name="C28V53">&nbsp;</a>And thou shalt eat the fruit of thine own body, the flesh of thy sons and of thy daughters, which the
LORD thy God hath given thee, in the siege, and in the straitness, wherewith thine enemies shall distress
thee:
 <span class="verse"> 54</span><a name="C28V54">&nbsp;</a><span class="add">So that</span> the man
<span class="add">that is</span> tender among you, and very delicate, his eye shall be evil toward his brother, and toward the wife of
his bosom, and toward the remnant of his children which he shall leave:
 <span class="verse"> 55</span><a name="C28V55">&nbsp;</a>So that he will not give to any of them of the flesh of his children whom he shall eat: because he hath
nothing left him in the siege, and in the straitness, wherewith thine enemies shall distress thee in
all thy gates.
 <span class="verse"> 56</span><a name="C28V56">&nbsp;</a>The tender and delicate woman among you, which would not adventure to set the sole of her foot upon the
ground for delicateness and tenderness, her eye shall be evil toward the husband of her bosom, and toward
her son, and toward her daughter,
 <span class="verse"> 57</span><a name="C28V57">&nbsp;</a>And toward her young one that cometh out from between her feet, and toward her children which she shall
bear: for she shall eat them for want of all
<span class="add">things</span> secretly in the siege and straitness, wherewith thine enemy shall distress thee in thy gates.
 <span class="verse"> 58</span><a name="C28V58">&nbsp;</a>If thou wilt not observe to do all the words of this law that are written in this book, that thou mayest
fear this glorious and fearful name, THE LORD THY GOD;
 <span class="verse"> 59</span><a name="C28V59">&nbsp;</a>Then the LORD will make thy plagues wonderful, and the plagues of thy seed,
<span class="add">even</span> great plagues, and of long continuance, and sore sicknesses, and of long continuance.
 <span class="verse"> 60</span><a name="C28V60">&nbsp;</a>Moreover he will bring upon thee all the diseases of Egypt, which thou wast afraid of; and they shall
cleave unto thee.
 <span class="verse"> 61</span><a name="C28V61">&nbsp;</a>Also every sickness, and every plague, which
<span class="add">is</span> not written in the book of this law, them will the LORD bring upon thee, until thou be destroyed.
 <span class="verse"> 62</span><a name="C28V62">&nbsp;</a>And ye shall be left few in number, whereas ye were as the stars of heaven for multitude; because thou
wouldest not obey the voice of the LORD thy God.
 <span class="verse"> 63</span><a name="C28V63">&nbsp;</a>And it shall come to pass,
<span class="add">that</span> as the LORD rejoiced over you to do you good, and to multiply you; so the LORD will rejoice over you
to destroy you, and to bring you to nought; and ye shall be plucked from off the land whither thou goest
to possess it.
 <span class="verse"> 64</span><a name="C28V64">&nbsp;</a>And the LORD shall scatter thee among all people, from the one end of the earth even unto the other;
and there thou shalt serve other gods, which neither thou nor thy fathers have known,
<span class="add">even</span> wood and stone.
 <span class="verse"> 65</span><a name="C28V65">&nbsp;</a>And among these nations shalt thou find no ease, neither shall the sole of thy foot have rest: but the
LORD shall give thee there a trembling heart, and failing of eyes, and sorrow of mind:
 <span class="verse"> 66</span><a name="C28V66">&nbsp;</a>And thy life shall hang in doubt before thee; and thou shalt fear day and night, and shalt have none
assurance of thy life:
 <span class="verse"> 67</span><a name="C28V67">&nbsp;</a>In the morning thou shalt say, Would God it were even! and at even thou shalt say, Would God it were
morning! for the fear of thine heart wherewith thou shalt fear, and for the sight of thine eyes which
thou shalt see.
 <span class="verse"> 68</span><a name="C28V68">&nbsp;</a>And the LORD shall bring thee into Egypt again with ships, by the way whereof I spake unto thee, Thou
shalt see it no more again: and there ye shall be sold unto your enemies for bondmen and bondwomen, and
no man shall buy
<span class="add">you.</span></div>
