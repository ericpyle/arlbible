 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C2V1">&nbsp;</a>Thus saith the Lord, I brought this people out of bondage, and I gave them my commandments by menservants
the prophets; whom they would not hear, but despised my counsels.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C2V2">&nbsp;</a>The mother that bare them saith unto them, Go your way, ye children; for I am a widow and forsaken.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C2V3">&nbsp;</a>I brought you up with gladness; but with sorrow and heaviness have I lost you: for ye have sinned before
the Lord your God, and done that thing that is evil before him.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C2V4">&nbsp;</a>But what shall I now do unto you? I am a widow and forsaken: go your way, O my children, and ask mercy
of the Lord.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C2V5">&nbsp;</a>As for me, O father, I call upon thee for a witness over the mother of these children, which would not
keep my covenant,
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C2V6">&nbsp;</a>That thou bring them to confusion, and their mother to a spoil, that there may be no offspring of them.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C2V7">&nbsp;</a>Let them be scattered abroad among the heathen, let their names be put out of the earth: for they have
despised my covenant.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C2V8">&nbsp;</a>Woe be unto thee, Assur, thou that hidest the unrighteous in thee! O thou wicked people, remember what
I did unto Sodom and Gomorrha;
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C2V9">&nbsp;</a>Whose land lieth in clods of pitch and heaps of ashes: even so also will I do unto them that hear me
not, saith the Almighty Lord.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C2V10">&nbsp;</a>Thus saith the Lord unto Esdras, Tell my people that I will give them the kingdom of Jerusalem, which
I would have given unto Israel.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C2V11">&nbsp;</a>Their glory also will I take unto me, and give these the everlasting tabernacles, which I had prepared
for them.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C2V12">&nbsp;</a>They shall have the tree of life for an ointment of sweet savour; they shall neither labour, nor be weary.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C2V13">&nbsp;</a>Go, and ye shall receive: pray for few days unto you, that they may be shortened: the kingdom is already
prepared for you: watch.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C2V14">&nbsp;</a>Take heaven and earth to witness; for I have broken the evil in pieces, and created the good: for I live,
saith the Lord.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C2V15">&nbsp;</a>Mother, embrace thy children, and bring them up with gladness, make their feet as fast as a pillar: for
I have chosen thee, saith the Lord.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C2V16">&nbsp;</a>And those that be dead will I raise up again from their places, and bring them out of the graves: for
I have known my name in Israel.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C2V17">&nbsp;</a>Fear not, thou mother of the children: for I have chosen thee, saith the Lord.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C2V18">&nbsp;</a>For thy help will I send my servants Esau and Jeremy, after whose counsel I have sanctified and prepared
for thee twelve trees laden with divers fruits,
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C2V19">&nbsp;</a>And as many fountains flowing with milk and honey, and seven mighty mountains, whereupon there grow roses
and lilies, whereby I will fill thy children with joy.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C2V20">&nbsp;</a>Do right to the widow, judge for the fatherless, give to the poor, defend the orphan, clothe the naked,
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C2V21">&nbsp;</a>Heal the broken and the weak, laugh not a lame man to scorn, defend the maimed, and let the blind man
come into the sight of my clearness.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C2V22">&nbsp;</a>Keep the old and young within thy walls.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C2V23">&nbsp;</a>Wheresoever thou findest the dead, take them and bury them, and I will give thee the first place in my
resurrection.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C2V24">&nbsp;</a>Abide still, O my people, and take thy rest, for thy quietness still come.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C2V25">&nbsp;</a>Nourish thy children, O thou good nurse; stablish their feet.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C2V26">&nbsp;</a>As for the servants whom I have given thee, there shall not one of them perish; for I will require them
from among thy number.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C2V27">&nbsp;</a>Be not weary: for when the day of trouble and heaviness cometh, others shall weep and be sorrowful, but
thou shalt be merry and have abundance.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C2V28">&nbsp;</a>The heathen shall envy thee, but they shall be able to do nothing against thee, saith the Lord.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C2V29">&nbsp;</a>My hands shall cover thee, so that thy children shall not see hell.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 30</span><a name="C2V30">&nbsp;</a>Be joyful, O thou mother, with thy children; for I will deliver thee, saith the Lord.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 31</span><a name="C2V31">&nbsp;</a>Remember thy children that sleep, for I shall bring them out of the sides of the earth, and shew mercy
unto them: for I am merciful, saith the Lord Almighty.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 32</span><a name="C2V32">&nbsp;</a>Embrace thy children until I come and shew mercy unto them: for my wells run over, and my grace shall
not fail.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 33</span><a name="C2V33">&nbsp;</a>I Esdras received a charge of the Lord upon the mount Oreb, that I should go unto Israel; but when I
came unto them, they set me at nought, and despised the commandment of the Lord.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 34</span><a name="C2V34">&nbsp;</a>And therefore I say unto you, O ye heathen, that hear and understand, look for your Shepherd, he shall
give you everlasting rest; for he is nigh at hand, that shall come in the end of the world.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 35</span><a name="C2V35">&nbsp;</a>Be ready to the reward of the kingdom, for the everlasting light shall shine upon you for evermore.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 36</span><a name="C2V36">&nbsp;</a>Flee the shadow of this world, receive the joyfulness of your glory: I testify my Saviour openly.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 37</span><a name="C2V37">&nbsp;</a>O receive the gift that is given you, and be glad, giving thanks unto him that hath led you to the heavenly
kingdom.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 38</span><a name="C2V38">&nbsp;</a>Arise up and stand, behold the number of those that be sealed in the feast of the Lord;
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 39</span><a name="C2V39">&nbsp;</a>Which are departed from the shadow of the world, and have received glorious garments of the Lord.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 40</span><a name="C2V40">&nbsp;</a>Take thy number, O Sion, and shut up those of thine that are clothed in white, which have fulfilled the
law of the Lord.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 41</span><a name="C2V41">&nbsp;</a>The number of thy children, whom thou longedst for, is fulfilled: beseech the power of the Lord, that
thy people, which have been called from the beginning, may be hallowed.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 42</span><a name="C2V42">&nbsp;</a>I Esdras saw upon the mount Sion a great people, whom I could not number, and they all praised the Lord
with songs.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 43</span><a name="C2V43">&nbsp;</a>And in the midst of them there was a young man of a high stature, taller than all the rest, and upon
every one of their heads he set crowns, and was more exalted; which I marvelled at greatly.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 44</span><a name="C2V44">&nbsp;</a>So I asked the angel, and said, Sir, what are these?
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 45</span><a name="C2V45">&nbsp;</a>He answered and said unto me, These be they that have put off the mortal clothing, and put on the immortal,
and have confessed the name of God: now are they crowned, and receive palms.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 46</span><a name="C2V46">&nbsp;</a>Then said I unto the angel, What young person is it that crowneth them, and giveth them palms in their
hands?
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 47</span><a name="C2V47">&nbsp;</a>So he answered and said unto me, It is the Son of God, whom they have confessed in the world. Then began
I greatly to commend them that stood so stiffly for the name of the Lord.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 48</span><a name="C2V48">&nbsp;</a>Then the angel said unto me, Go thy way, and tell my people what manner of things, and how great wonders
of the Lord thy God, thou hast seen.
