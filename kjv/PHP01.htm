<div class="mt1">The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians
</div>
<div class="chapterlabel"> 1</div><div class="p">
 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C1V1">&nbsp;</a>Paul and Timotheus, the servants of Jesus Christ, to all the saints in Christ Jesus which are at Philippi,
with the bishops and deacons:
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C1V2">&nbsp;</a>Grace
<span class="add">be</span> unto you, and peace, from God our Father, and
<span class="add">from</span> the Lord Jesus Christ.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C1V3">&nbsp;</a>I thank my God upon every remembrance of you,
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C1V4">&nbsp;</a>Always in every prayer of mine for you all making request with joy,
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C1V5">&nbsp;</a>For your fellowship in the gospel from the first day until now;
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C1V6">&nbsp;</a>Being confident of this very thing, that he which hath begun a good work in you will perform
<span class="add">it</span> until the day of Jesus Christ:
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C1V7">&nbsp;</a>Even as it is meet for me to think this of you all, because I have you in my heart; inasmuch as both
in my bonds, and in the defence and confirmation of the gospel, ye all are partakers of my grace.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C1V8">&nbsp;</a>For God is my record, how greatly I long after you all in the bowels of Jesus Christ.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C1V9">&nbsp;</a>And this I pray, that your love may abound yet more and more in knowledge and
<span class="add">in</span> all judgment;
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C1V10">&nbsp;</a>That ye may approve things that are excellent; that ye may be sincere and without offence till the day
of Christ;
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C1V11">&nbsp;</a>Being filled with the fruits of righteousness, which are by Jesus Christ, unto the glory and praise of
God.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C1V12">&nbsp;</a>But I would ye should understand, brethren, that the things
<span class="add">which happened</span> unto me have fallen out rather unto the furtherance of the gospel;
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C1V13">&nbsp;</a>So that my bonds in Christ are manifest in all the palace, and in all other
<span class="add">places;
</span> <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C1V14">&nbsp;</a>And many of the brethren in the Lord, waxing confident by my bonds, are much more bold to speak the word
without fear.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C1V15">&nbsp;</a>Some indeed preach Christ even of envy and strife; and some also of good will:
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C1V16">&nbsp;</a>The one preach Christ of contention, not sincerely, supposing to add affliction to my bonds:
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C1V17">&nbsp;</a>But the other of love, knowing that I am set for the defence of the gospel.
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C1V18">&nbsp;</a>What then? notwithstanding, every way, whether in pretence, or in truth, Christ is preached; and I therein
do rejoice, yea, and will rejoice.
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C1V19">&nbsp;</a>For I know that this shall turn to my salvation through your prayer, and the supply of the Spirit of
Jesus Christ,
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C1V20">&nbsp;</a>According to my earnest expectation and
<span class="add">my</span> hope, that in nothing I shall be ashamed, but
<span class="add">that</span> with all boldness, as always,
<span class="add">so</span> now also Christ shall be magnified in my body, whether
<span class="add">it be</span> by life, or by death.
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C1V21">&nbsp;</a>For to me to live
<span class="add">is</span> Christ, and to die
<span class="add">is</span> gain.
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C1V22">&nbsp;</a>But if I live in the flesh, this
<span class="add">is</span> the fruit of my labour: yet what I shall choose I wot not.
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C1V23">&nbsp;</a>For I am in a strait betwixt two, having a desire to depart, and to be with Christ; which is far better:
 <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C1V24">&nbsp;</a>Nevertheless to abide in the flesh
<span class="add">is</span> more needful for you.
 <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C1V25">&nbsp;</a>And having this confidence, I know that I shall abide and continue with you all for your furtherance
and joy of faith;
 <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C1V26">&nbsp;</a>That your rejoicing may be more abundant in Jesus Christ for me by my coming to you again.
 <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C1V27">&nbsp;</a>Only let your conversation be as it becometh the gospel of Christ: that whether I come and see you, or
else be absent, I may hear of your affairs, that ye stand fast in one spirit, with one mind striving
together for the faith of the gospel;
 <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C1V28">&nbsp;</a>And in nothing terrified by your adversaries: which is to them an evident token of perdition, but to
you of salvation, and that of God.
 <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C1V29">&nbsp;</a>For unto you it is given in the behalf of Christ, not only to believe on him, but also to suffer for
his sake;
 <span class="verse"> 30</span><a name="C1V30">&nbsp;</a>Having the same conflict which ye saw in me, and now hear
<span class="add">to be
</span> in me.
