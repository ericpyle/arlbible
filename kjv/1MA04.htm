<div class="chapterlabel"> 4</div><div class="p">
 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C4V1">&nbsp;</a>Then took Gorgias five thousand footmen, and a thousand of the best horsemen, and removed out of the
camp by night;
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C4V2">&nbsp;</a>To the end he might rush in upon the camp of the Jews, and smite them suddenly. And the men of the fortress
were his guides.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C4V3">&nbsp;</a>Now when Judas heard thereof he himself removed, and the valiant men with him, that he might smite the
king’s army which was at Emmaus,
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C4V4">&nbsp;</a>While as yet the forces were dispersed from the camp.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C4V5">&nbsp;</a>In the mean season came Gorgias by night into the camp of Judas: and when he found no man there, he sought
them in the mountains: for said he, These fellows flee from us
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C4V6">&nbsp;</a>But as soon as it was day, Judas shewed himself in the plain with three thousand men, who nevertheless
had neither armour nor swords to their minds.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C4V7">&nbsp;</a>And they saw the camp of the heathen, that it was strong and well harnessed, and compassed round about
with horsemen; and these were expert of war.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C4V8">&nbsp;</a>Then said Judas to the men that were with him, Fear ye not their multitude, neither be ye afraid of their
assault.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C4V9">&nbsp;</a>Remember how our fathers were delivered in the Red sea, when Pharaoh pursued them with an army.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C4V10">&nbsp;</a>Now therefore let us cry unto heaven, if peradventure the Lord will have mercy upon us, and remember
the covenant of our fathers, and destroy this host before our face this day:
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C4V11">&nbsp;</a>That so all the heathen may know that there is one who delivereth and saveth Israel.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C4V12">&nbsp;</a>Then the strangers lifted up their eyes, and saw them coming over against them.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C4V13">&nbsp;</a>Wherefore they went out of the camp to battle; but they that were with Judas sounded their trumpets.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C4V14">&nbsp;</a>So they joined battle, and the heathen being discomfited fled into the plain.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C4V15">&nbsp;</a>Howbeit all the hindmost of them were slain with the sword: for they pursued them unto Gazera, and unto
the plains of Idumea, and Azotus, and Jamnia, so that there were slain of them upon a three thousand
men.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C4V16">&nbsp;</a>This done, Judas returned again with his host from pursuing them,
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C4V17">&nbsp;</a>And said to the people, Be not greedy of the spoil inasmuch as there is a battle before us,
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C4V18">&nbsp;</a>And Gorgias and his host are here by us in the mountain: but stand ye now against our enemies, and overcome
them, and after this ye may boldly take the spoils.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C4V19">&nbsp;</a>As Judas was yet speaking these words, there appeared a part of them looking out of the mountain:
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C4V20">&nbsp;</a>Who when they perceived that the Jews had put their host to flight and were burning the tents; for the
smoke that was seen declared what was done:
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C4V21">&nbsp;</a>When therefore they perceived these things, they were sore afraid, and seeing also the host of Judas
in the plain ready to fight,
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C4V22">&nbsp;</a>They fled every one into the land of strangers.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C4V23">&nbsp;</a>Then Judas returned to spoil the tents, where they got much gold, and silver, and blue silk, and purple
of the sea, and great riches.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C4V24">&nbsp;</a>After this they went home, and sung a song of thanksgiving, and praised the Lord in heaven: because it
is good, because his mercy endureth forever.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C4V25">&nbsp;</a>Thus Israel had a great deliverance that day.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C4V26">&nbsp;</a>Now all the strangers that had escaped came and told Lysias what had happened:
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C4V27">&nbsp;</a>Who, when he heard thereof, was confounded and discouraged, because neither such things as he would were
done unto Israel, nor such things as the king commanded him were come to pass.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C4V28">&nbsp;</a>The next year therefore following Lysias gathered together threescore thousand choice men of foot, and
five thousand horsemen, that he might subdue them.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C4V29">&nbsp;</a>So they came into Idumea, and pitched their tents at Bethsura, and Judas met them with ten thousand men.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 30</span><a name="C4V30">&nbsp;</a>And when he saw that mighty army, he prayed and said, Blessed art thou, O Saviour of Israel, who didst
quell the violence of the mighty man by the hand of thy servant David, and gavest the host of strangers
into the hands of Jonathan the son of Saul, and his armourbearer;
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 31</span><a name="C4V31">&nbsp;</a>Shut up this army in the hand of thy people Israel, and let them be confounded in their power and horsemen:
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 32</span><a name="C4V32">&nbsp;</a>Make them to be of no courage, and cause the boldness of their strength to fall away, and let them quake
at their destruction:
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 33</span><a name="C4V33">&nbsp;</a>Cast them down with the sword of them that love thee, and let all those that know thy name praise thee
with thanksgiving.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 34</span><a name="C4V34">&nbsp;</a>So they joined battle; and there were slain of the host of Lysias about five thousand men, even before
them were they slain.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 35</span><a name="C4V35">&nbsp;</a>Now when Lysias saw his army put to flight, and the manliness of Judas’ soldiers, and how they were ready
either to live or die valiantly, he went into Antiochia, and gathered together a company of strangers,
and having made his army greater than it was, he purposed to come again into Judea.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 36</span><a name="C4V36">&nbsp;</a>Then said Judas and his brethren, Behold, our enemies are discomfited: let us go up to cleanse and dedicate
the sanctuary.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 37</span><a name="C4V37">&nbsp;</a>Upon this all the host assembled themselves together, and went up into mount Sion.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 38</span><a name="C4V38">&nbsp;</a>And when they saw the sanctuary desolate, and the altar profaned, and the gates burned up, and shrubs
growing in the courts as in a forest, or in one of the mountains, yea, and the priests’ chambers pulled
down;
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 39</span><a name="C4V39">&nbsp;</a>They rent their clothes, and made great lamentation, and cast ashes upon their heads,
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 40</span><a name="C4V40">&nbsp;</a>And fell down flat to the ground upon their faces, and blew an alarm with the trumpets, and cried toward
heaven.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 41</span><a name="C4V41">&nbsp;</a>Then Judas appointed certain men to fight against those that were in the fortress, until he had cleansed
the sanctuary.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 42</span><a name="C4V42">&nbsp;</a>So he chose priests of blameless conversation, such as had pleasure in the law:
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 43</span><a name="C4V43">&nbsp;</a>Who cleansed the sanctuary, and bare out the defiled stones into an unclean place.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 44</span><a name="C4V44">&nbsp;</a>And when as they consulted what to do with the altar of burnt offerings, which was profaned;
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 45</span><a name="C4V45">&nbsp;</a>They thought it best to pull it down, lest it should be a reproach to them, because the heathen had defiled
it: wherefore they pulled it down,
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 46</span><a name="C4V46">&nbsp;</a>And laid up the stones in the mountain of the temple in a convenient place, until there should come a
prophet to shew what should be done with them.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 47</span><a name="C4V47">&nbsp;</a>Then they took whole stones according to the law, and built a new altar according to the former;
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 48</span><a name="C4V48">&nbsp;</a>And made up the sanctuary, and the things that were within the temple, and hallowed the courts.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 49</span><a name="C4V49">&nbsp;</a>They made also new holy vessels, and into the temple they brought the candlestick, and the altar of burnt
offerings, and of incense, and the table.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 50</span><a name="C4V50">&nbsp;</a>And upon the altar they burned incense, and the lamps that were upon the candlestick they lighted, that
they might give light in the temple.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 51</span><a name="C4V51">&nbsp;</a>Furthermore they set the loaves upon the table, and spread out the veils, and finished all the works
which they had begun to make.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 52</span><a name="C4V52">&nbsp;</a>Now on the five and twentieth day of the ninth month, which is called the month Casleu, in the hundred
forty and eighth year, they rose up betimes in the morning,
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 53</span><a name="C4V53">&nbsp;</a>And offered sacrifice according to the law upon the new altar of burnt offerings, which they had made.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 54</span><a name="C4V54">&nbsp;</a>Look, at what time and what day the heathen had profaned it, even in that was it dedicated with songs,
and citherns, and harps, and cymbals.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 55</span><a name="C4V55">&nbsp;</a>Then all the people fell upon their faces, worshipping and praising the God of heaven, who had given
them good success.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 56</span><a name="C4V56">&nbsp;</a>And so they kept the dedication of the altar eight days and offered burnt offerings with gladness, and
sacrificed the sacrifice of deliverance and praise.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 57</span><a name="C4V57">&nbsp;</a>They decked also the forefront of the temple with crowns of gold, and with shields; and the gates and
the chambers they renewed, and hanged doors upon them.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 58</span><a name="C4V58">&nbsp;</a>Thus was there very great gladness among the people, for that the reproach of the heathen was put away.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 59</span><a name="C4V59">&nbsp;</a>Moreover Judas and his brethren with the whole congregation of Israel ordained, that the days of the
dedication of the altar should be kept in their season from year to year by the space of eight days,
from the five and twentieth day of the month Casleu, with mirth and gladness.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 60</span><a name="C4V60">&nbsp;</a>At that time also they builded up the mount Sion with high walls and strong towers round about, lest
the Gentiles should come and tread it down as they had done before.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 61</span><a name="C4V61">&nbsp;</a>And they set there a garrison to keep it, and fortified Bethsura to preserve it; that the people might
have a defence against Idumea.
