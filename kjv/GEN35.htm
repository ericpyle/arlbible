 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C35V1">&nbsp;</a>And God said unto Jacob, Arise, go up to Bethel, and dwell there: and make there an altar unto God, that
appeared unto thee when thou fleddest from the face of Esau thy brother.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C35V2">&nbsp;</a>Then Jacob said unto his household, and to all that
<span class="add">were</span> with him, Put away the strange gods that
<span class="add">are</span> among you, and be clean, and change your garments:
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C35V3">&nbsp;</a>And let us arise, and go up to Bethel; and I will make there an altar unto God, who answered me in the
day of my distress, and was with me in the way which I went.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C35V4">&nbsp;</a>And they gave unto Jacob all the strange gods which
<span class="add">were</span> in their hand, and
<span class="add">all their</span> earrings which
<span class="add">were</span> in their ears; and Jacob hid them under the oak which
<span class="add">was</span> by Shechem.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C35V5">&nbsp;</a>And they journeyed: and the terror of God was upon the cities that
<span class="add">were</span> round about them, and they did not pursue after the sons of Jacob.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C35V6">&nbsp;</a>So Jacob came to Luz, which
<span class="add">is</span> in the land of Canaan, that
<span class="add">is,</span> Bethel, he and all the people that
<span class="add">were</span> with him.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C35V7">&nbsp;</a>And he built there an altar, and called the place El-beth-el: because there God appeared unto him, when
he fled from the face of his brother.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C35V8">&nbsp;</a>But Deborah Rebekah’s nurse died, and she was buried beneath Bethel under an oak: and the name of it
was called Allon-bachuth.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C35V9">&nbsp;</a>And God appeared unto Jacob again, when he came out of Padan-aram, and blessed him.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C35V10">&nbsp;</a>And God said unto him, Thy name
<span class="add">is</span> Jacob: thy name shall not be called any more Jacob, but Israel shall be thy name: and he called his
name Israel.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C35V11">&nbsp;</a>And God said unto him, I
<span class="add">am</span> God Almighty: be fruitful and multiply; a nation and a company of nations shall be of thee, and kings
shall come out of thy loins;
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C35V12">&nbsp;</a>And the land which I gave Abraham and Isaac, to thee I will give it, and to thy seed after thee will
I give the land.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C35V13">&nbsp;</a>And God went up from him in the place where he talked with him.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C35V14">&nbsp;</a>And Jacob set up a pillar in the place where he talked with him,
<span class="add">even</span> a pillar of stone: and he poured a drink offering thereon, and he poured oil thereon.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C35V15">&nbsp;</a>And Jacob called the name of the place where God spake with him, Bethel.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C35V16">&nbsp;</a>And they journeyed from Bethel; and there was but a little way to come to Ephrath: and Rachel travailed,
and she had hard labour.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C35V17">&nbsp;</a>And it came to pass, when she was in hard labour, that the midwife said unto her, Fear not; thou shalt
have this son also.
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C35V18">&nbsp;</a>And it came to pass, as her soul was in departing, (for she died) that she called his name Ben-oni: but
his father called him Benjamin.
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C35V19">&nbsp;</a>And Rachel died, and was buried in the way to Ephrath, which
<span class="add">is</span> Bethlehem.
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C35V20">&nbsp;</a>And Jacob set a pillar upon her grave: that
<span class="add">is</span> the pillar of Rachel’s grave unto this day.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C35V21">&nbsp;</a>And Israel journeyed, and spread his tent beyond the tower of Edar.
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C35V22">&nbsp;</a>And it came to pass, when Israel dwelt in that land, that Reuben went and lay with Bilhah his father’s
concubine: and Israel heard
<span class="add">it.</span> Now the sons of Jacob were twelve:
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C35V23">&nbsp;</a>The sons of Leah; Reuben, Jacob’s firstborn, and Simeon, and Levi, and Judah, and Issachar, and Zebulun:
 <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C35V24">&nbsp;</a>The sons of Rachel; Joseph, and Benjamin:
 <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C35V25">&nbsp;</a>And the sons of Bilhah, Rachel’s handmaid; Dan, and Naphtali:
 <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C35V26">&nbsp;</a>And the sons of Zilpah, Leah’s handmaid; Gad, and Asher: these
<span class="add">are</span> the sons of Jacob, which were born to him in Padan-aram.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C35V27">&nbsp;</a>And Jacob came unto Isaac his father unto Mamre, unto the city of Arbah, which
<span class="add">is</span> Hebron, where Abraham and Isaac sojourned.
 <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C35V28">&nbsp;</a>And the days of Isaac were an hundred and fourscore years.
 <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C35V29">&nbsp;</a>And Isaac gave up the ghost, and died, and was gathered unto his people,
<span class="add">being</span> old and full of days: and his sons Esau and Jacob buried him.
