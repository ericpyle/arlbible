 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C4V1">&nbsp;</a>I charge
<span class="add">thee</span> therefore before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, who shall judge the quick and the dead at his appearing
and his kingdom;
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C4V2">&nbsp;</a>Preach the word; be instant in season, out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort with all longsuffering
and doctrine.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C4V3">&nbsp;</a>For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine; but after their own lusts shall they
heap to themselves teachers, having itching ears;
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C4V4">&nbsp;</a>And they shall turn away
<span class="add">their</span> ears from the truth, and shall be turned unto fables.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C4V5">&nbsp;</a>But watch thou in all things, endure afflictions, do the work of an evangelist, make full proof of thy
ministry.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C4V6">&nbsp;</a>For I am now ready to be offered, and the time of my departure is at hand.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C4V7">&nbsp;</a>I have fought a good fight, I have finished
<span class="add">my</span> course, I have kept the faith:
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C4V8">&nbsp;</a>Henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, shall
give me at that day: and not to me only, but unto all them also that love his appearing.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C4V9">&nbsp;</a>Do thy diligence to come shortly unto me:
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C4V10">&nbsp;</a>For Demas hath forsaken me, having loved this present world, and is departed unto Thessalonica; Crescens
to Galatia, Titus unto Dalmatia.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C4V11">&nbsp;</a>Only Luke is with me. Take Mark, and bring him with thee: for he is profitable to me for the ministry.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C4V12">&nbsp;</a>And Tychicus have I sent to Ephesus.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C4V13">&nbsp;</a>The cloke that I left at Troas with Carpus, when thou comest, bring
<span class="add">with thee,</span> and the books,
<span class="add">but</span> especially the parchments.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C4V14">&nbsp;</a>Alexander the coppersmith did me much evil: the Lord reward him according to his works:
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C4V15">&nbsp;</a>Of whom be thou ware also; for he hath greatly withstood our words.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C4V16">&nbsp;</a>At my first answer no man stood with me, but all
<span class="add">men</span> forsook me:
<span class="add">I pray God</span> that it may not be laid to their charge.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C4V17">&nbsp;</a>Notwithstanding the Lord stood with me, and strengthened me; that by me the preaching might be fully
known, and
<span class="add">that</span> all the Gentiles might hear: and I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion.
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C4V18">&nbsp;</a>And the Lord shall deliver me from every evil work, and will preserve
<span class="add">me</span> unto his heavenly kingdom: to whom
<span class="add">be</span> glory for ever and ever. Amen.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C4V19">&nbsp;</a>Salute Prisca and Aquila, and the household of Onesiphorus.
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C4V20">&nbsp;</a>Erastus abode at Corinth: but Trophimus have I left at Miletum sick.
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C4V21">&nbsp;</a>Do thy diligence to come before winter. Eubulus greeteth thee, and Pudens, and Linus, and Claudia, and
all the brethren.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C4V22">&nbsp;</a>The Lord Jesus Christ
<span class="add">be</span> with thy spirit. Grace
<span class="add">be
</span> with you. Amen.
