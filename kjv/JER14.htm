 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C14V1">&nbsp;</a>The word of the LORD that came to Jeremiah concerning the dearth.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C14V2">&nbsp;</a>Judah mourneth, and the gates thereof languish; they are black unto the ground; and the cry of Jerusalem
is gone up.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C14V3">&nbsp;</a>And their nobles have sent their little ones to the waters: they came to the pits,
<span class="add">and</span> found no water; they returned with their vessels empty; they were ashamed and confounded, and covered
their heads.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C14V4">&nbsp;</a>Because the ground is chapt, for there was no rain in the earth, the plowmen were ashamed, they covered
their heads.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C14V5">&nbsp;</a>Yea, the hind also calved in the field, and forsook
<span class="add">it,</span> because there was no grass.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C14V6">&nbsp;</a>And the wild asses did stand in the high places, they snuffed up the wind like dragons; their eyes did
fail, because
<span class="add">there was</span> no grass.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C14V7">&nbsp;</a>O LORD, though our iniquities testify against us, do thou
<span class="add">it
</span> for thy name’s sake: for our backslidings are many; we have sinned against thee.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C14V8">&nbsp;</a>O the hope of Israel, the saviour thereof in time of trouble, why shouldest thou be as a stranger in
the land, and as a wayfaring man
<span class="add">that</span> turneth aside to tarry for a night?
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C14V9">&nbsp;</a>Why shouldest thou be as a man astonied, as a mighty man
<span class="add">that
</span> cannot save? yet thou, O LORD,
<span class="add">art</span> in the midst of us, and we are called by thy name; leave us not.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C14V10">&nbsp;</a>Thus saith the LORD unto this people, Thus have they loved to wander, they have not refrained their feet,
therefore the LORD doth not accept them; he will now remember their iniquity, and visit their sins.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C14V11">&nbsp;</a>Then said the LORD unto me, Pray not for this people for
<span class="add">their
</span> good.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C14V12">&nbsp;</a>When they fast, I will not hear their cry; and when they offer burnt offering and an oblation, I will
not accept them: but I will consume them by the sword, and by the famine, and by the pestilence.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C14V13">&nbsp;</a>Then said I, Ah, Lord GOD! behold, the prophets say unto them, Ye shall not see the sword, neither shall
ye have famine; but I will give you assured peace in this place.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C14V14">&nbsp;</a>Then the LORD said unto me, The prophets prophesy lies in my name: I sent them not, neither have I commanded
them, neither spake unto them: they prophesy unto you a false vision and divination, and a thing of nought,
and the deceit of their heart.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C14V15">&nbsp;</a>Therefore thus saith the LORD concerning the prophets that prophesy in my name, and I sent them not,
yet they say, Sword and famine shall not be in this land; By sword and famine shall those prophets be
consumed.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C14V16">&nbsp;</a>And the people to whom they prophesy shall be cast out in the streets of Jerusalem because of the famine
and the sword; and they shall have none to bury them, them, their wives, nor their sons, nor their daughters:
for I will pour their wickedness upon them.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C14V17">&nbsp;</a>Therefore thou shalt say this word unto them; Let mine eyes run down with tears night and day, and let
them not cease: for the virgin daughter of my people is broken with a great breach, with a very grievous
blow.
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C14V18">&nbsp;</a>If I go forth into the field, then behold the slain with the sword! and if I enter into the city, then
behold them that are sick with famine! yea, both the prophet and the priest go about into a land that
they know not.
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C14V19">&nbsp;</a>Hast thou utterly rejected Judah? hath thy soul lothed Zion? why hast thou smitten us, and
<span class="add">there is</span> no healing for us? we looked for peace, and
<span class="add">there is</span> no good; and for the time of healing, and behold trouble!
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C14V20">&nbsp;</a>We acknowledge, O LORD, our wickedness,
<span class="add">and</span> the iniquity of our fathers: for we have sinned against thee.
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C14V21">&nbsp;</a>Do not abhor
<span class="add">us,</span> for thy name’s sake, do not disgrace the throne of thy glory: remember, break not thy covenant with
us.
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C14V22">&nbsp;</a>Are there
<span class="add">any</span> among the vanities of the Gentiles that can cause rain? or can the heavens give showers?
<span class="add">art</span> not thou he, O LORD our God? therefore we will wait upon thee: for thou hast made all these
<span class="add">things.</span></div>
