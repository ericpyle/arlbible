 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C9V1">&nbsp;</a>Am I not an apostle? am I not free? have I not seen Jesus Christ our Lord? are not ye my work in the
Lord?
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C9V2">&nbsp;</a>If I be not an apostle unto others, yet doubtless I am to you: for the seal of mine apostleship are ye
in the Lord.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C9V3">&nbsp;</a>Mine answer to them that do examine me is this,
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C9V4">&nbsp;</a>Have we not power to eat and to drink?
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C9V5">&nbsp;</a>Have we not power to lead about a sister, a wife, as well as other apostles, and
<span class="add">as</span> the brethren of the Lord, and Cephas?
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C9V6">&nbsp;</a>Or I only and Barnabas, have not we power to forbear working?
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C9V7">&nbsp;</a>Who goeth a warfare any time at his own charges? who planteth a vineyard, and eateth not of the fruit
thereof? or who feedeth a flock, and eateth not of the milk of the flock?
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C9V8">&nbsp;</a>Say I these things as a man? or saith not the law the same also?
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C9V9">&nbsp;</a>For it is written in the law of Moses, Thou shalt not muzzle the mouth of the ox that treadeth out the
corn. Doth God take care for oxen?
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C9V10">&nbsp;</a>Or saith he
<span class="add">it</span> altogether for our sakes? For our sakes, no doubt,
<span class="add">this</span> is written: that he that ploweth should plow in hope; and that he that thresheth in hope should be partaker
of his hope.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C9V11">&nbsp;</a>If we have sown unto you spiritual things,
<span class="add">is it</span> a great thing if we shall reap your carnal things?
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C9V12">&nbsp;</a>If others be partakers of
<span class="add">this</span> power over you,
<span class="add">are</span> not we rather? Nevertheless we have not used this power; but suffer all things, lest we should hinder
the gospel of Christ.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C9V13">&nbsp;</a>Do ye not know that they which minister about holy things live
<span class="add">of the things</span> of the temple? and they which wait at the altar are partakers with the altar?
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C9V14">&nbsp;</a>Even so hath the Lord ordained that they which preach the gospel should live of the gospel.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C9V15">&nbsp;</a>But I have used none of these things: neither have I written these things, that it should be so done
unto me: for
<span class="add">it were</span> better for me to die, than that any man should make my glorying void.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C9V16">&nbsp;</a>For though I preach the gospel, I have nothing to glory of: for necessity is laid upon me; yea, woe is
unto me, if I preach not the gospel!
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C9V17">&nbsp;</a>For if I do this thing willingly, I have a reward: but if against my will, a dispensation
<span class="add">of the gospel</span> is committed unto me.
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C9V18">&nbsp;</a>What is my reward then?
<span class="add">Verily</span> that, when I preach the gospel, I may make the gospel of Christ without charge, that I abuse not my
power in the gospel.
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C9V19">&nbsp;</a>For though I be free from all
<span class="add">men,</span> yet have I made myself servant unto all, that I might gain the more.
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C9V20">&nbsp;</a>And unto the Jews I became as a Jew, that I might gain the Jews; to them that are under the law, as under
the law, that I might gain them that are under the law;
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C9V21">&nbsp;</a>To them that are without law, as without law, (being not without law to God, but under the law to Christ,)
that I might gain them that are without law.
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C9V22">&nbsp;</a>To the weak became I as weak, that I might gain the weak: I am made all things to all
<span class="add">men,</span> that I might by all means save some.
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C9V23">&nbsp;</a>And this I do for the gospel’s sake, that I might be partaker thereof with
<span class="add">you.
</span> <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C9V24">&nbsp;</a>Know ye not that they which run in a race run all, but one receiveth the prize? So run, that ye may obtain.
 <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C9V25">&nbsp;</a>And every man that striveth for the mastery is temperate in all things. Now they
<span class="add">do it</span> to obtain a corruptible crown; but we an incorruptible.
 <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C9V26">&nbsp;</a>I therefore so run, not as uncertainly; so fight I, not as one that beateth the air:
 <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C9V27">&nbsp;</a>But I keep under my body, and bring
<span class="add">it</span> into subjection: lest that by any means, when I have preached to others, I myself should be a castaway.
