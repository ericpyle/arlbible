 <span class="verse" id="V1">1&nbsp;</span>Again the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span>Son of man, cause Jerusalem to know her abominations,  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>And say, Thus saith the Lord GOD unto Jerusalem; Thy birth and thy nativity <span class='add'>is</span> of the land of Canaan; thy father <span class='add'>was</span> an Amorite, and thy mother an Hittite.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>And <span class='add'>as for</span> thy nativity, in the day thou wast born thy navel was not cut, neither wast thou washed in water to supple <span class='add'>thee;</span> thou wast not salted at all, nor swaddled at all.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>None eye pitied thee, to do any of these unto thee, to have compassion upon thee; but thou wast cast out in the open field, to the lothing of thy person, in the day that thou wast born. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>And when I passed by thee, and saw thee polluted in thine own blood, I said unto thee <span class='add'>when thou wast</span> in thy blood, Live; yea, I said unto thee <span class='add'>when thou wast</span> in thy blood, Live.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>I have caused thee to multiply as the bud of the field, and thou hast increased and waxen great, and thou art come to excellent ornaments: <span class='add'>thy</span> breasts are fashioned, and thine hair is grown, whereas thou <span class='add'>wast</span> naked and bare.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>Now when I passed by thee, and looked upon thee, behold, thy time <span class='add'>was</span> the time of love; and I spread my skirt over thee, and covered thy nakedness: yea, I sware unto thee, and entered into a covenant with thee, saith the Lord GOD, and thou becamest mine.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>Then washed I thee with water; yea, I throughly washed away thy blood from thee, and I anointed thee with oil.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>I clothed thee also with broidered work, and shod thee with badgers’ skin, and I girded thee about with fine linen, and I covered thee with silk.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>I decked thee also with ornaments, and I put bracelets upon thy hands, and a chain on thy neck.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>And I put a jewel on thy forehead, and earrings in thine ears, and a beautiful crown upon thine head.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>Thus wast thou decked with gold and silver; and thy raiment <span class='add'>was of</span> fine linen, and silk, and broidered work; thou didst eat fine flour, and honey, and oil: and thou wast exceeding beautiful, and thou didst prosper into a kingdom.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>And thy renown went forth among the heathen for thy beauty: for it <span class='add'>was</span> perfect through my comeliness, which I had put upon thee, saith the Lord GOD.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>But thou didst trust in thine own beauty, and playedst the harlot because of thy renown, and pouredst out thy fornications on every one that passed by; his it was.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>And of thy garments thou didst take, and deckedst thy high places with divers colours, and playedst the harlot thereupon: <span class='add'>the like things</span> shall not come, neither shall it be so.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>Thou hast also taken thy fair jewels of my gold and of my silver, which I had given thee, and madest to thyself images of men, and didst commit whoredom with them,  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>And tookest thy broidered garments, and coveredst them: and thou hast set mine oil and mine incense before them.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>My meat also which I gave thee, fine flour, and oil, and honey, <span class='add'>wherewith</span> I fed thee, thou hast even set it before them for a sweet savour: and <span class='add'>thus</span> it was, saith the Lord GOD.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>Moreover thou hast taken thy sons and thy daughters, whom thou hast borne unto me, and these hast thou sacrificed unto them to be devoured. <span class='add'>Is this</span> of thy whoredoms a small matter,  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>That thou hast slain my children, and delivered them to cause them to pass through <span class='add'>the fire</span> for them?  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>And in all thine abominations and thy whoredoms thou hast not remembered the days of thy youth, when thou wast naked and bare, <span class='add'>and</span> wast polluted in thy blood.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>And it came to pass after all thy wickedness, (woe, woe unto thee! saith the Lord GOD;)  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span> <span class='add'>That</span> thou hast also built unto thee an eminent place, and hast made thee an high place in every street.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>Thou hast built thy high place at every head of the way, and hast made thy beauty to be abhorred, and hast opened thy feet to every one that passed by, and multiplied thy whoredoms.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>Thou hast also committed fornication with the Egyptians thy neighbours, great of flesh; and hast increased thy whoredoms, to provoke me to anger.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>Behold, therefore I have stretched out my hand over thee, and have diminished thine ordinary <span class='add'>food</span>, and delivered thee unto the will of them that hate thee, the daughters of the Philistines, which are ashamed of thy lewd way.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&nbsp;</span>Thou hast played the whore also with the Assyrians, because thou wast unsatiable; yea, thou hast played the harlot with them, and yet couldest not be satisfied.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&nbsp;</span>Thou hast moreover multiplied thy fornication in the land of Canaan unto Chaldea; and yet thou wast not satisfied herewith.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&nbsp;</span>How weak is thine heart, saith the Lord GOD, seeing thou doest all these <span class='add'>things</span>, the work of an imperious whorish woman;  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&nbsp;</span>In that thou buildest thine eminent place in the head of every way, and makest thine high place in every street; and hast not been as an harlot, in that thou scornest hire;  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&nbsp;</span> <span class='add'>But as</span> a wife that committeth adultery, <span class='add'>which</span> taketh strangers instead of her husband!  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&nbsp;</span>They give gifts to all whores: but thou givest thy gifts to all thy lovers, and hirest them, that they may come unto thee on every side for thy whoredom.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&nbsp;</span>And the contrary is in thee from <span class='add'>other</span> women in thy whoredoms, whereas none followeth thee to commit whoredoms: and in that thou givest a reward, and no reward is given unto thee, therefore thou art contrary. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V35">35&nbsp;</span>Wherefore, O harlot, hear the word of the LORD:  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&nbsp;</span>Thus saith the Lord GOD; Because thy filthiness was poured out, and thy nakedness discovered through thy whoredoms with thy lovers, and with all the idols of thy abominations, and by the blood of thy children, which thou didst give unto them;  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&nbsp;</span>Behold, therefore I will gather all thy lovers, with whom thou hast taken pleasure, and all <span class='add'>them</span> that thou hast loved, with all <span class='add'>them</span> that thou hast hated; I will even gather them round about against thee, and will discover thy nakedness unto them, that they may see all thy nakedness.  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&nbsp;</span>And I will judge thee, as women that break wedlock and shed blood are judged; and I will give thee blood in fury and jealousy.  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&nbsp;</span>And I will also give thee into their hand, and they shall throw down thine eminent place, and shall break down thy high places: they shall strip thee also of thy clothes, and shall take thy fair jewels, and leave thee naked and bare.  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&nbsp;</span>They shall also bring up a company against thee, and they shall stone thee with stones, and thrust thee through with their swords.  <span class="verse" id="V41">41&nbsp;</span>And they shall burn thine houses with fire, and execute judgments upon thee in the sight of many women: and I will cause thee to cease from playing the harlot, and thou also shalt give no hire any more.  <span class="verse" id="V42">42&nbsp;</span>So will I make my fury toward thee to rest, and my jealousy shall depart from thee, and I will be quiet, and will be no more angry.  <span class="verse" id="V43">43&nbsp;</span>Because thou hast not remembered the days of thy youth, but hast fretted me in all these <span class='add'>things;</span> behold, therefore I also will recompense thy way upon <span class='add'>thine</span> head, saith the Lord GOD: and thou shalt not commit this lewdness above all thine abominations. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V44">44&nbsp;</span>Behold, every one that useth proverbs shall use <span class='add'>this</span> proverb against thee, saying, As is the mother, <span class='add'>so is</span> her daughter.  <span class="verse" id="V45">45&nbsp;</span>Thou <span class='add'>art</span> thy mother’s daughter, that lotheth her husband and her children; and thou <span class='add'>art</span> the sister of thy sisters, which lothed their husbands and their children: your mother <span class='add'>was</span> an Hittite, and your father an Amorite.  <span class="verse" id="V46">46&nbsp;</span>And thine elder sister <span class='add'>is</span> Samaria, she and her daughters that dwell at thy left hand: and thy younger sister, that dwelleth at thy right hand, <span class='add'>is</span> Sodom and her daughters.  <span class="verse" id="V47">47&nbsp;</span>Yet hast thou not walked after their ways, nor done after their abominations: but, as <span class='add'>if that were</span> a very little <span class='add'>thing</span>, thou wast corrupted more than they in all thy ways.  <span class="verse" id="V48">48&nbsp;</span> <span class='add'>As</span> I live, saith the Lord GOD, Sodom thy sister hath not done, she nor her daughters, as thou hast done, thou and thy daughters.  <span class="verse" id="V49">49&nbsp;</span>Behold, this was the iniquity of thy sister Sodom, pride, fulness of bread, and abundance of idleness was in her and in her daughters, neither did she strengthen the hand of the poor and needy.  <span class="verse" id="V50">50&nbsp;</span>And they were haughty, and committed abomination before me: therefore I took them away as I saw <span class='add'>good</span>.  <span class="verse" id="V51">51&nbsp;</span>Neither hath Samaria committed half of thy sins; but thou hast multiplied thine abominations more than they, and hast justified thy sisters in all thine abominations which thou hast done.  <span class="verse" id="V52">52&nbsp;</span>Thou also, which hast judged thy sisters, bear thine own shame for thy sins that thou hast committed more abominable than they: they are more righteous than thou: yea, be thou confounded also, and bear thy shame, in that thou hast justified thy sisters.  <span class="verse" id="V53">53&nbsp;</span>When I shall bring again their captivity, the captivity of Sodom and her daughters, and the captivity of Samaria and her daughters, then <span class='add'>will I bring again</span> the captivity of thy captives in the midst of them:  <span class="verse" id="V54">54&nbsp;</span>That thou mayest bear thine own shame, and mayest be confounded in all that thou hast done, in that thou art a comfort unto them.  <span class="verse" id="V55">55&nbsp;</span>When thy sisters, Sodom and her daughters, shall return to their former estate, and Samaria and her daughters shall return to their former estate, then thou and thy daughters shall return to your former estate.  <span class="verse" id="V56">56&nbsp;</span>For thy sister Sodom was not mentioned by thy mouth in the day of thy pride,  <span class="verse" id="V57">57&nbsp;</span>Before thy wickedness was discovered, as at the time of <span class='add'>thy</span> reproach of the daughters of Syria, and all <span class='add'>that are</span> round about her, the daughters of the Philistines, which despise thee round about.  <span class="verse" id="V58">58&nbsp;</span>Thou hast borne thy lewdness and thine abominations, saith the LORD.  <span class="verse" id="V59">59&nbsp;</span>For thus saith the Lord GOD;
