 <span class="verse" id="V1">1&nbsp;</span>And afterward Moses and Aaron went in, and told Pharaoh, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Let my people go, that they may hold a feast unto me in the wilderness.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span>And Pharaoh said, Who <span class='add'>is</span> the LORD, that I should obey his voice to let Israel go? I know not the LORD, neither will I let Israel go.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>And they said, The God of the Hebrews hath met with us: let us go, we pray thee, three days’ journey into the desert, and sacrifice unto the LORD our God; lest he fall upon us with pestilence, or with the sword.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>And the king of Egypt said unto them, Wherefore do ye, Moses and Aaron, let the people from their works? get you unto your burdens.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>And Pharaoh said, Behold, the people of the land now <span class='add'>are</span> many, and ye make them rest from their burdens.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>And Pharaoh commanded the same day the taskmasters of the people, and their officers, saying,  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>Ye shall no more give the people straw to make brick, as heretofore: let them go and gather straw for themselves.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>And the tale of the bricks, which they did make heretofore, ye shall lay upon them; ye shall not diminish <span class='add'>ought</span> thereof: for they <span class='add'>be</span> idle; therefore they cry, saying, Let us go <span class='add'>and</span> sacrifice to our God.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>Let there more work be laid upon the men, that they may labour therein; and let them not regard vain words. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>And the taskmasters of the people went out, and their officers, and they spake to the people, saying, Thus saith Pharaoh, I will not give you straw.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>Go ye, get you straw where ye can find it: yet not ought of your work shall be diminished.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>So the people were scattered abroad throughout all the land of Egypt to gather stubble instead of straw.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>And the taskmasters hasted <span class='add'>them</span>, saying, Fulfil your works, <span class='add'>your</span> daily tasks, as when there was straw.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>And the officers of the children of Israel, which Pharaoh’s taskmasters had set over them, were beaten, <span class='add'>and</span> demanded, Wherefore have ye not fulfilled your task in making brick both yesterday and to day, as heretofore? </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>Then the officers of the children of Israel came and cried unto Pharaoh, saying, Wherefore dealest thou thus with thy servants?  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>There is no straw given unto thy servants, and they say to us, Make brick: and, behold, thy servants <span class='add'>are</span> beaten; but the fault <span class='add'>is</span> in thine own people.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>But he said, Ye <span class='add'>are</span> idle, <span class='add'>ye are</span> idle: therefore ye say, Let us go <span class='add'>and</span> do sacrifice to the LORD.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>Go therefore now, <span class='add'>and</span> work; for there shall no straw be given you, yet shall ye deliver the tale of bricks.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>And the officers of the children of Israel did see <span class='add'>that</span> they <span class='add'>were</span> in evil <span class='add'>case</span>, after it was said, Ye shall not minish <span class='add'>ought</span> from your bricks of your daily task. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>And they met Moses and Aaron, who stood in the way, as they came forth from Pharaoh:  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>And they said unto them, The LORD look upon you, and judge; because ye have made our savour to be abhorred in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of his servants, to put a sword in their hand to slay us.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>And Moses returned unto the LORD, and said, Lord, wherefore hast thou <span class='add'>so</span> evil entreated this people? why <span class='add'>is</span> it <span class='add'>that</span> thou hast sent me?  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>For since I came to Pharaoh to speak in thy name, he hath done evil to this people; neither hast thou delivered thy people at all. </div><ul class='tnav'>
