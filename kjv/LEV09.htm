 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C9V1">&nbsp;</a>And it came to pass on the eighth day,
<span class="add">that</span> Moses called Aaron and his sons, and the elders of Israel;
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C9V2">&nbsp;</a>And he said unto Aaron, Take thee a young calf for a sin offering, and a ram for a burnt offering, without
blemish, and offer
<span class="add">them</span> before the LORD.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C9V3">&nbsp;</a>And unto the children of Israel thou shalt speak, saying, Take ye a kid of the goats for a sin offering;
and a calf and a lamb,
<span class="add">both</span> of the first year, without blemish, for a burnt offering;
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C9V4">&nbsp;</a>Also a bullock and a ram for peace offerings, to sacrifice before the LORD; and a meat offering mingled
with oil: for to day the LORD will appear unto you.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C9V5">&nbsp;</a>And they brought
<span class="add">that</span> which Moses commanded before the tabernacle of the congregation: and all the congregation drew near
and stood before the LORD.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C9V6">&nbsp;</a>And Moses said, This
<span class="add">is</span> the thing which the LORD commanded that ye should do: and the glory of the LORD shall appear unto you.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C9V7">&nbsp;</a>And Moses said unto Aaron, Go unto the altar, and offer thy sin offering, and thy burnt offering, and
make an atonement for thyself, and for the people: and offer the offering of the people, and make an
atonement for them; as the LORD commanded.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C9V8">&nbsp;</a>Aaron therefore went unto the altar, and slew the calf of the sin offering, which
<span class="add">was</span> for himself.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C9V9">&nbsp;</a>And the sons of Aaron brought the blood unto him: and he dipped his finger in the blood, and put
<span class="add">it</span> upon the horns of the altar, and poured out the blood at the bottom of the altar:
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C9V10">&nbsp;</a>But the fat, and the kidneys, and the caul above the liver of the sin offering, he burnt upon the altar;
as the LORD commanded Moses.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C9V11">&nbsp;</a>And the flesh and the hide he burnt with fire without the camp.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C9V12">&nbsp;</a>And he slew the burnt offering; and Aaron’s sons presented unto him the blood, which he sprinkled round
about upon the altar.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C9V13">&nbsp;</a>And they presented the burnt offering unto him, with the pieces thereof, and the head: and he burnt
<span class="add">them</span> upon the altar.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C9V14">&nbsp;</a>And he did wash the inwards and the legs, and burnt
<span class="add">them
</span> upon the burnt offering on the altar.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C9V15">&nbsp;</a>And he brought the people’s offering, and took the goat, which
<span class="add">was</span> the sin offering for the people, and slew it, and offered it for sin, as the first.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C9V16">&nbsp;</a>And he brought the burnt offering, and offered it according to the manner.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C9V17">&nbsp;</a>And he brought the meat offering, and took an handful thereof, and burnt
<span class="add">it</span> upon the altar, beside the burnt sacrifice of the morning.
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C9V18">&nbsp;</a>He slew also the bullock and the ram
<span class="add">for</span> a sacrifice of peace offerings, which
<span class="add">was</span> for the people: and Aaron’s sons presented unto him the blood, which he sprinkled upon the altar round
about,
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C9V19">&nbsp;</a>And the fat of the bullock and of the ram, the rump, and that which covereth
<span class="add">the inwards,</span> and the kidneys, and the caul
<span class="add">above
</span> the liver:
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C9V20">&nbsp;</a>And they put the fat upon the breasts, and he burnt the fat upon the altar:
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C9V21">&nbsp;</a>And the breasts and the right shoulder Aaron waved
<span class="add">for</span> a wave offering before the LORD; as Moses commanded.
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C9V22">&nbsp;</a>And Aaron lifted up his hand toward the people, and blessed them, and came down from offering of the
sin offering, and the burnt offering, and peace offerings.
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C9V23">&nbsp;</a>And Moses and Aaron went into the tabernacle of the congregation, and came out, and blessed the people:
and the glory of the LORD appeared unto all the people.
 <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C9V24">&nbsp;</a>And there came a fire out from before the LORD, and consumed upon the altar the burnt offering and the
fat:
<span class="add">which</span> when all the people saw, they shouted, and fell on their faces.
