 <span class="verse" id="V1">1&nbsp;</span> James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, to the twelve tribes which are scattered abroad, greeting. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span> My brethren, count it all joy when ye fall into divers temptations;  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span> Knowing <span class='add'>this</span>, that the trying of your faith worketh patience.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span> But let patience have <span class='add'>her</span> perfect work, that ye may be perfect and entire, wanting nothing.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span> If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all <span class='add'>men</span> liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span> But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering. For he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span> For let not that man think that he shall receive any thing of the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span> A double minded man <span class='add'>is</span> unstable in all his ways.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span> Let the brother of low degree rejoice in that he is exalted:  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span> But the rich, in that he is made low: because as the flower of the grass he shall pass away.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span> For the sun is no sooner risen with a burning heat, but it withereth the grass, and the flower thereof falleth, and the grace of the fashion of it perisheth: so also shall the rich man fade away in his ways.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span> Blessed <span class='add'>is</span> the man that endureth temptation: for when he is tried, he shall receive the crown of life, which the Lord hath promised to them that love him.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span> Let no man say when he is tempted, I am tempted of God: for God cannot be tempted with evil, neither tempteth he any man:  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span> But every man is tempted, when he is drawn away of his own lust, and enticed.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span> Then when lust hath conceived, it bringeth forth sin: and sin, when it is finished, bringeth forth death.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span> Do not err, my beloved brethren.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span> Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and cometh down from the Father of lights, with whom is no variableness, neither shadow of turning.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span> Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth, that we should be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span> Wherefore, my beloved brethren, let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath:  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span> For the wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of God.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span> Wherefore lay apart all filthiness and superfluity of naughtiness, and receive with meekness the engrafted word, which is able to save your souls.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span> But be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving your own selves.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span> For if any be a hearer of the word, and not a doer, he is like unto a man beholding his natural face in a glass:  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span> For he beholdeth himself, and goeth his way, and straightway forgetteth what manner of man he was.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span> But whoso looketh into the perfect law of liberty, and continueth <span class='add'>therein</span>, he being not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work, this man shall be blessed in his deed.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span> If any man among you seem to be religious, and bridleth not his tongue, but deceiveth his own heart, this man’s religion <span class='add'>is</span> vain.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span> Pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this, To visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, <span class='add'>and</span> to keep himself unspotted from the world. </div><ul class='tnav'>
