<div class="mt1">The General Epistle of James
</div>
<div class="chapterlabel"> 1</div><div class="p">
 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C1V1">&nbsp;</a>James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, to the twelve tribes which are scattered abroad,
greeting.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C1V2">&nbsp;</a>My brethren, count it all joy when ye fall into divers temptations;
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C1V3">&nbsp;</a>Knowing
<span class="add">this,</span> that the trying of your faith worketh patience.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C1V4">&nbsp;</a>But let patience have
<span class="add">her</span> perfect work, that ye may be perfect and entire, wanting nothing.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C1V5">&nbsp;</a>If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all
<span class="add">men</span> liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C1V6">&nbsp;</a>But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering. For he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with
the wind and tossed.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C1V7">&nbsp;</a>For let not that man think that he shall receive any thing of the Lord.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C1V8">&nbsp;</a>A double minded man
<span class="add">is</span> unstable in all his ways.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C1V9">&nbsp;</a>Let the brother of low degree rejoice in that he is exalted:
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C1V10">&nbsp;</a>But the rich, in that he is made low: because as the flower of the grass he shall pass away.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C1V11">&nbsp;</a>For the sun is no sooner risen with a burning heat, but it withereth the grass, and the flower thereof
falleth, and the grace of the fashion of it perisheth: so also shall the rich man fade away in his ways.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C1V12">&nbsp;</a>Blessed
<span class="add">is</span> the man that endureth temptation: for when he is tried, he shall receive the crown of life, which the
Lord hath promised to them that love him.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C1V13">&nbsp;</a>Let no man say when he is tempted, I am tempted of God: for God cannot be tempted with evil, neither
tempteth he any man:
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C1V14">&nbsp;</a>But every man is tempted, when he is drawn away of his own lust, and enticed.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C1V15">&nbsp;</a>Then when lust hath conceived, it bringeth forth sin: and sin, when it is finished, bringeth forth death.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C1V16">&nbsp;</a>Do not err, my beloved brethren.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C1V17">&nbsp;</a>Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and cometh down from the Father of lights, with
whom is no variableness, neither shadow of turning.
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C1V18">&nbsp;</a>Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth, that we should be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C1V19">&nbsp;</a>Wherefore, my beloved brethren, let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath:
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C1V20">&nbsp;</a>For the wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of God.
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C1V21">&nbsp;</a>Wherefore lay apart all filthiness and superfluity of naughtiness, and receive with meekness the engrafted
word, which is able to save your souls.
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C1V22">&nbsp;</a>But be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving your own selves.
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C1V23">&nbsp;</a>For if any be a hearer of the word, and not a doer, he is like unto a man beholding his natural face
in a glass:
 <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C1V24">&nbsp;</a>For he beholdeth himself, and goeth his way, and straightway forgetteth what manner of man he was.
 <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C1V25">&nbsp;</a>But whoso looketh into the perfect law of liberty, and continueth
<span class="add">therein,</span> he being not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work, this man shall be blessed in his deed.
 <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C1V26">&nbsp;</a>If any man among you seem to be religious, and bridleth not his tongue, but deceiveth his own heart,
this man’s religion
<span class="add">is</span> vain.
 <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C1V27">&nbsp;</a>Pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this, To visit the fatherless and widows in
their affliction,
<span class="add">and</span> to keep himself unspotted from the world.
