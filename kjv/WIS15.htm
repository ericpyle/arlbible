<div class="chapterlabel"> 15</div><div class="p">
 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C15V1">&nbsp;</a>But thou, O God, art gracious and true, longsuffering, and in mercy ordering all things,
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C15V2">&nbsp;</a>For if we sin, we are thine, knowing thy power: but we will not sin, knowing that we are counted thine.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C15V3">&nbsp;</a>For to know thee is perfect righteousness: yea, to know thy power is the root of immortality.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C15V4">&nbsp;</a>For neither did the mischievous invention of men deceive us, nor an image spotted with divers colours,
the painter’s fruitless labour;
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C15V5">&nbsp;</a>The sight whereof enticeth fools to lust after it, and so they desire the form of a dead image, that
hath no breath.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C15V6">&nbsp;</a>Both they that make them, they that desire them, and they that worship them, are lovers of evil things,
and are worthy to have such things to trust upon.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C15V7">&nbsp;</a>For the potter, tempering soft earth, fashioneth every vessel with much labour for our service: yea,
of the same clay he maketh both the vessels that serve for clean uses, and likewise also all such as
serve to the contrary: but what is the use of either sort, the potter himself is the judge.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C15V8">&nbsp;</a>And employing his labours lewdly, he maketh a vain god of the same clay, even he which a little before
was made of earth himself, and within a little while after returneth to the same, out when his life which
was lent him shall be demanded.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C15V9">&nbsp;</a>Notwithstanding his care is, not that he shall have much labour, nor that his life is short: but striveth
to excel goldsmiths and silversmiths, and endeavoureth to do like the workers in brass, and counteth
it his glory to make counterfeit things.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C15V10">&nbsp;</a>His heart is ashes, his hope is more vile than earth, and his life of less value than clay:
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C15V11">&nbsp;</a>Forasmuch as he knew not his Maker, and him that inspired into him an active soul, and breathed in a
living spirit.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C15V12">&nbsp;</a>But they counted our life a pastime, and our time here a market for gain: for, say they, we must be getting
every way, though it be by evil means.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C15V13">&nbsp;</a>For this man, that of earthly matter maketh brittle vessels and graven images, knoweth himself to offend
above all others.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C15V14">&nbsp;</a>And all the enemies of thy people, that hold them in subjection, are most foolish, and are more miserable
than very babes.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C15V15">&nbsp;</a>For they counted all the idols of the heathen to be gods: which neither have the use of eyes to see,
nor noses to draw breath, nor ears to hear, nor fingers of hands to handle; and as for their feet, they
are slow to go.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C15V16">&nbsp;</a>For man made them, and he that borrowed his own spirit fashioned them: but no man can make a god like
unto himself.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C15V17">&nbsp;</a>For being mortal, he worketh a dead thing with wicked hands: for he himself is better than the things
which he worshippeth: whereas he lived once, but they never.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C15V18">&nbsp;</a>Yea, they worshipped those beasts also that are most hateful: for being compared together, some are worse
than others.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C15V19">&nbsp;</a>Neither are they beautiful, so much as to be desired in respect of beasts: but they went without the
praise of God and his blessing.
