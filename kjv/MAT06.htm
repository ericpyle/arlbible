 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C6V1">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Take heed that ye do not your alms before men, to be seen of them: otherwise ye have no reward of your
Father which is in heaven.
</span> <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C6V2">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Therefore when thou doest
thine alms, do not sound a trumpet before thee, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets,
that they may have glory of men. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.
</span> <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C6V3">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">But when thou doest alms, let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth:
</span> <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C6V4">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">That thine alms may be in secret: and thy Father which seeth in secret himself shall reward thee openly.</span></div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C6V5">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And when thou prayest, thou shalt not be as the hypocrites
are: for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets, that they may be
seen of men. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.
</span> <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C6V6">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father
which is in secret; and thy Father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly.
</span> <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C6V7">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">But when ye pray, use not vain repetitions, as the heathen
do: for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking.
</span> <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C6V8">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Be not ye therefore like unto them: for your Father knoweth what things ye have need of, before ye ask
him.
</span> <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C6V9">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">After this manner therefore pray ye: Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name.
</span> <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C6V10">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, as
it is in heaven.
</span> <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C6V11">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Give us this day our daily bread.
</span> <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C6V12">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors.
</span> <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C6V13">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil: For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and
the glory, for ever. Amen.
</span> <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C6V14">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">For if ye forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you:
</span> <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C6V15">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">But if ye forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.</span></div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C6V16">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Moreover when ye fast, be not, as the hypocrites, of a sad countenance: for they disfigure their faces,
that they may appear unto men to fast. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.
</span> <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C6V17">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">But thou, when thou fastest, anoint thine head, and wash thy face;
</span> <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C6V18">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">That thou appear not unto men to fast, but unto thy Father which is in secret: and thy Father, which
seeth in secret, shall reward thee openly.
</span></div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C6V19">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and rust doth corrupt, and where thieves break
through and steal:
</span> <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C6V20">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">But lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt, and where thieves
do not break through nor steal:
</span> <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C6V21">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.
</span> <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C6V22">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">The light of the body is the eye: if therefore thine eye be single, thy whole body shall be full of light.
</span> <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C6V23">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">But if thine eye be evil, thy whole body shall be full of darkness. If therefore the light that is in
thee be darkness, how great
is that darkness!</span></div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C6V24">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">No man can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold
to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon.
</span> <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C6V25">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Therefore I say unto you, Take no thought for your life, what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink; nor
yet for your body, what ye shall put on. Is not the life more than meat, and the body than raiment?
</span> <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C6V26">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Behold the fowls of the air: for they sow not, neither do they reap, nor gather into barns; yet your
heavenly Father feedeth them. Are ye not much better than they?
</span> <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C6V27">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Which of you by taking thought can add one cubit unto his stature?
</span> <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C6V28">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And why take ye thought for raiment? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow; they toil not,
neither do they spin:
</span> <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C6V29">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And yet I say unto you, That even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.
</span> <span class="verse"> 30</span><a name="C6V30">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Wherefore, if God so clothe the grass of the field, which to day is, and to morrow is cast into the oven,
shall he not much more
clothe you, O ye of little faith?
</span> <span class="verse"> 31</span><a name="C6V31">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Therefore take no thought, saying, What shall we eat? or, What shall we drink? or, Wherewithal shall
we be clothed?
</span> <span class="verse"> 32</span><a name="C6V32">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">(For after all these things do the Gentiles seek:) for your heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need
of all these things.
</span> <span class="verse"> 33</span><a name="C6V33">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto
you.
</span> <span class="verse"> 34</span><a name="C6V34">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Take therefore no thought for the morrow: for the morrow shall take thought for the things of itself.
Sufficient unto the day
is the evil thereof.</span></div>
