 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C26V1">&nbsp;</a>Ye shall make you no idols nor graven image, neither rear you up a standing image, neither shall ye set
up
<span class="add">any</span> image of stone in your land, to bow down unto it: for I
<span class="add">am</span> the LORD your God.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C26V2">&nbsp;</a>Ye shall keep my sabbaths, and reverence my sanctuary: I
<span class="add">am</span> the LORD.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C26V3">&nbsp;</a>If ye walk in my statutes, and keep my commandments, and do them;
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C26V4">&nbsp;</a>Then I will give you rain in due season, and the land shall yield her increase, and the trees of the
field shall yield their fruit.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C26V5">&nbsp;</a>And your threshing shall reach unto the vintage, and the vintage shall reach unto the sowing time: and
ye shall eat your bread to the full, and dwell in your land safely.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C26V6">&nbsp;</a>And I will give peace in the land, and ye shall lie down, and none shall make
<span class="add">you</span> afraid: and I will rid evil beasts out of the land, neither shall the sword go through your land.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C26V7">&nbsp;</a>And ye shall chase your enemies, and they shall fall before you by the sword.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C26V8">&nbsp;</a>And five of you shall chase an hundred, and an hundred of you shall put ten thousand to flight: and your
enemies shall fall before you by the sword.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C26V9">&nbsp;</a>For I will have respect unto you, and make you fruitful, and multiply you, and establish my covenant
with you.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C26V10">&nbsp;</a>And ye shall eat old store, and bring forth the old because of the new.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C26V11">&nbsp;</a>And I will set my tabernacle among you: and my soul shall not abhor you.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C26V12">&nbsp;</a>And I will walk among you, and will be your God, and ye shall be my people.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C26V13">&nbsp;</a>I
<span class="add">am</span> the LORD your God, which brought you forth out of the land of Egypt, that ye should not be their bondmen;
and I have broken the bands of your yoke, and made you go upright.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C26V14">&nbsp;</a>But if ye will not hearken unto me, and will not do all these commandments;
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C26V15">&nbsp;</a>And if ye shall despise my statutes, or if your soul abhor my judgments, so that ye will not do all my
commandments,
<span class="add">but</span> that ye break my covenant:
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C26V16">&nbsp;</a>I also will do this unto you; I will even appoint over you terror, consumption, and the burning ague,
that shall consume the eyes, and cause sorrow of heart: and ye shall sow your seed in vain, for your
enemies shall eat it.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C26V17">&nbsp;</a>And I will set my face against you, and ye shall be slain before your enemies: they that hate you shall
reign over you; and ye shall flee when none pursueth you.
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C26V18">&nbsp;</a>And if ye will not yet for all this hearken unto me, then I will punish you seven times more for your
sins.
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C26V19">&nbsp;</a>And I will break the pride of your power; and I will make your heaven as iron, and your earth as brass:
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C26V20">&nbsp;</a>And your strength shall be spent in vain: for your land shall not yield her increase, neither shall the
trees of the land yield their fruits.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C26V21">&nbsp;</a>And if ye walk contrary unto me, and will not hearken unto me; I will bring seven times more plagues
upon you according to your sins.
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C26V22">&nbsp;</a>I will also send wild beasts among you, which shall rob you of your children, and destroy your cattle,
and make you few in number; and your
<span class="add">high</span> ways shall be desolate.
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C26V23">&nbsp;</a>And if ye will not be reformed by me by these things, but will walk contrary unto me;
 <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C26V24">&nbsp;</a>Then will I also walk contrary unto you, and will punish you yet seven times for your sins.
 <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C26V25">&nbsp;</a>And I will bring a sword upon you, that shall avenge the quarrel of
<span class="add">my</span> covenant: and when ye are gathered together within your cities, I will send the pestilence among you;
and ye shall be delivered into the hand of the enemy.
 <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C26V26">&nbsp;</a><span class="add">And</span> when I have broken the staff of your bread, ten women shall bake your bread in one oven, and they shall
deliver
<span class="add">you</span> your bread again by weight: and ye shall eat, and not be satisfied.
 <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C26V27">&nbsp;</a>And if ye will not for all this hearken unto me, but walk contrary unto me;
 <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C26V28">&nbsp;</a>Then I will walk contrary unto you also in fury; and I, even I, will chastise you seven times for your
sins.
 <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C26V29">&nbsp;</a>And ye shall eat the flesh of your sons, and the flesh of your daughters shall ye eat.
 <span class="verse"> 30</span><a name="C26V30">&nbsp;</a>And I will destroy your high places, and cut down your images, and cast your carcases upon the carcases
of your idols, and my soul shall abhor you.
 <span class="verse"> 31</span><a name="C26V31">&nbsp;</a>And I will make your cities waste, and bring your sanctuaries unto desolation, and I will not smell the
savour of your sweet odours.
 <span class="verse"> 32</span><a name="C26V32">&nbsp;</a>And I will bring the land into desolation: and your enemies which dwell therein shall be astonished at
it.
 <span class="verse"> 33</span><a name="C26V33">&nbsp;</a>And I will scatter you among the heathen, and will draw out a sword after you: and your land shall be
desolate, and your cities waste.
 <span class="verse"> 34</span><a name="C26V34">&nbsp;</a>Then shall the land enjoy her sabbaths, as long as it lieth desolate, and ye be in your enemies’ land;
<span class="add">even</span> then shall the land rest, and enjoy her sabbaths.
 <span class="verse"> 35</span><a name="C26V35">&nbsp;</a>As long as it lieth desolate it shall rest; because it did not rest in your sabbaths, when ye dwelt upon
it.
 <span class="verse"> 36</span><a name="C26V36">&nbsp;</a>And upon them that are left
<span class="add">alive</span> of you I will send a faintness into their hearts in the lands of their enemies; and the sound of a shaken
leaf shall chase them; and they shall flee, as fleeing from a sword; and they shall fall when none pursueth.
 <span class="verse"> 37</span><a name="C26V37">&nbsp;</a>And they shall fall one upon another, as it were before a sword, when none pursueth: and ye shall have
no power to stand before your enemies.
 <span class="verse"> 38</span><a name="C26V38">&nbsp;</a>And ye shall perish among the heathen, and the land of your enemies shall eat you up.
 <span class="verse"> 39</span><a name="C26V39">&nbsp;</a>And they that are left of you shall pine away in their iniquity in your enemies’ lands; and also in the
iniquities of their fathers shall they pine away with them.
 <span class="verse"> 40</span><a name="C26V40">&nbsp;</a>If they shall confess their iniquity, and the iniquity of their fathers, with their trespass which they
trespassed against me, and that also they have walked contrary unto me;
 <span class="verse"> 41</span><a name="C26V41">&nbsp;</a>And
<span class="add">that</span> I also have walked contrary unto them, and have brought them into the land of their enemies; if then
their uncircumcised hearts be humbled, and they then accept of the punishment of their iniquity:
 <span class="verse"> 42</span><a name="C26V42">&nbsp;</a>Then will I remember my covenant with Jacob, and also my covenant with Isaac, and also my covenant with
Abraham will I remember; and I will remember the land.
 <span class="verse"> 43</span><a name="C26V43">&nbsp;</a>The land also shall be left of them, and shall enjoy her sabbaths, while she lieth desolate without them:
and they shall accept of the punishment of their iniquity: because, even because they despised my judgments,
and because their soul abhorred my statutes.
 <span class="verse"> 44</span><a name="C26V44">&nbsp;</a>And yet for all that, when they be in the land of their enemies, I will not cast them away, neither will
I abhor them, to destroy them utterly, and to break my covenant with them: for I
<span class="add">am</span> the LORD their God.
 <span class="verse"> 45</span><a name="C26V45">&nbsp;</a>But I will for their sakes remember the covenant of their ancestors, whom I brought forth out of the
land of Egypt in the sight of the heathen, that I might be their God: I
<span class="add">am</span> the LORD.
 <span class="verse"> 46</span><a name="C26V46">&nbsp;</a>These
<span class="add">are</span> the statutes and judgments and laws, which the LORD made between him and the children of Israel in mount
Sinai by the hand of Moses.
