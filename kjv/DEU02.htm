 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C2V1">&nbsp;</a>Then we turned, and took our journey into the wilderness by the way of the Red sea, as the LORD spake
unto me: and we compassed mount Seir many days.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C2V2">&nbsp;</a>And the LORD spake unto me, saying,
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C2V3">&nbsp;</a>Ye have compassed this mountain long enough: turn you northward.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C2V4">&nbsp;</a>And command thou the people, saying, Ye
<span class="add">are</span> to pass through the coast of your brethren the children of Esau, which dwell in Seir; and they shall
be afraid of you: take ye good heed unto yourselves therefore:
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C2V5">&nbsp;</a>Meddle not with them; for I will not give you of their land, no, not so much as a footbreadth; because
I have given mount Seir unto Esau
<span class="add">for</span> a possession.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C2V6">&nbsp;</a>Ye shall buy meat of them for money, that ye may eat; and ye shall also buy water of them for money,
that ye may drink.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C2V7">&nbsp;</a>For the LORD thy God hath blessed thee in all the works of thy hand: he knoweth thy walking through this
great wilderness: these forty years the LORD thy God
<span class="add">hath been</span> with thee; thou hast lacked nothing.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C2V8">&nbsp;</a>And when we passed by from our brethren the children of Esau, which dwelt in Seir, through the way of
the plain from Elath, and from Ezion-gaber, we turned and passed by the way of the wilderness of Moab.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C2V9">&nbsp;</a>And the LORD said unto me, Distress not the Moabites, neither contend with them in battle: for I will
not give thee of their land
<span class="add">for</span> a possession; because I have given Ar unto the children of Lot
<span class="add">for</span> a possession.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C2V10">&nbsp;</a>The Emims dwelt therein in times past, a people great, and many, and tall, as the Anakims;
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C2V11">&nbsp;</a>Which also were accounted giants, as the Anakims; but the Moabites call them Emims.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C2V12">&nbsp;</a>The Horims also dwelt in Seir beforetime; but the children of Esau succeeded them, when they had destroyed
them from before them, and dwelt in their stead; as Israel did unto the land of his possession, which
the LORD gave unto them.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C2V13">&nbsp;</a>Now rise up,
<span class="add">said I,</span> and get you over the brook Zered. And we went over the brook Zered.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C2V14">&nbsp;</a>And the space in which we came from Kadesh-barnea, until we were come over the brook Zered,
<span class="add">was</span> thirty and eight years; until all the generation of the men of war were wasted out from among the host,
as the LORD sware unto them.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C2V15">&nbsp;</a>For indeed the hand of the LORD was against them, to destroy them from among the host, until they were
consumed.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C2V16">&nbsp;</a>So it came to pass, when all the men of war were consumed and dead from among the people,
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C2V17">&nbsp;</a>That the LORD spake unto me, saying,
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C2V18">&nbsp;</a>Thou art to pass over through Ar, the coast of Moab, this day:
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C2V19">&nbsp;</a>And
<span class="add">when</span> thou comest nigh over against the children of Ammon, distress them not, nor meddle with them: for I
will not give thee of the land of the children of Ammon
<span class="add">any</span> possession; because I have given it unto the children of Lot
<span class="add">for</span> a possession.
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C2V20">&nbsp;</a>(That also was accounted a land of giants: giants dwelt therein in old time; and the Ammonites call them
Zamzummims;
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C2V21">&nbsp;</a>A people great, and many, and tall, as the Anakims; but the LORD destroyed them before them; and they
succeeded them, and dwelt in their stead:
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C2V22">&nbsp;</a>As he did to the children of Esau, which dwelt in Seir, when he destroyed the Horims from before them;
and they succeeded them, and dwelt in their stead even unto this day:
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C2V23">&nbsp;</a>And the Avims which dwelt in Hazerim,
<span class="add">even</span> unto Azzah, the Caphtorims, which came forth out of Caphtor, destroyed them, and dwelt in their stead.)
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C2V24">&nbsp;</a>Rise ye up, take your journey, and pass over the river Arnon: behold, I have given into thine hand Sihon
the Amorite, king of Heshbon, and his land: begin to possess
<span class="add">it,</span> and contend with him in battle.
 <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C2V25">&nbsp;</a>This day will I begin to put the dread of thee and the fear of thee upon the nations
<span class="add">that are</span> under the whole heaven, who shall hear report of thee, and shall tremble, and be in anguish because
of thee.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C2V26">&nbsp;</a>And I sent messengers out of the wilderness of Kedemoth unto Sihon king of Heshbon with words of peace,
saying,
 <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C2V27">&nbsp;</a>Let me pass through thy land: I will go along by the high way, I will neither turn unto the right hand
nor to the left.
 <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C2V28">&nbsp;</a>Thou shalt sell me meat for money, that I may eat; and give me water for money, that I may drink: only
I will pass through on my feet;
 <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C2V29">&nbsp;</a>(As the children of Esau which dwell in Seir, and the Moabites which dwell in Ar, did unto me;) until
I shall pass over Jordan into the land which the LORD our God giveth us.
 <span class="verse"> 30</span><a name="C2V30">&nbsp;</a>But Sihon king of Heshbon would not let us pass by him: for the LORD thy God hardened his spirit, and
made his heart obstinate, that he might deliver him into thy hand, as
<span class="add">appeareth</span> this day.
 <span class="verse"> 31</span><a name="C2V31">&nbsp;</a>And the LORD said unto me, Behold, I have begun to give Sihon and his land before thee: begin to possess,
that thou mayest inherit his land.
 <span class="verse"> 32</span><a name="C2V32">&nbsp;</a>Then Sihon came out against us, he and all his people, to fight at Jahaz.
 <span class="verse"> 33</span><a name="C2V33">&nbsp;</a>And the LORD our God delivered him before us; and we smote him, and his sons, and all his people.
 <span class="verse"> 34</span><a name="C2V34">&nbsp;</a>And we took all his cities at that time, and utterly destroyed the men, and the women, and the little
ones, of every city, we left none to remain:
 <span class="verse"> 35</span><a name="C2V35">&nbsp;</a>Only the cattle we took for a prey unto ourselves, and the spoil of the cities which we took.
 <span class="verse"> 36</span><a name="C2V36">&nbsp;</a>From Aroer, which
<span class="add">is</span> by the brink of the river of Arnon, and
<span class="add">from</span> the city that
<span class="add">is</span> by the river, even unto Gilead, there was not one city too strong for us: the LORD our God delivered
all unto us:
 <span class="verse"> 37</span><a name="C2V37">&nbsp;</a>Only unto the land of the children of Ammon thou camest not, nor unto any place of the river Jabbok,
<span class="add">nor</span> unto the cities in the mountains, nor unto whatsoever the LORD our God forbad us.
