 <span class="verse" id="V1">1&nbsp;</span>Then we turned, and took our journey into the wilderness by the way of the Red sea, as the LORD spake unto me: and we compassed mount Seir many days.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span>And the LORD spake unto me, saying,  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>Ye have compassed this mountain long enough: turn you northward.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>And command thou the people, saying, Ye <span class='add'>are</span> to pass through the coast of your brethren the children of Esau, which dwell in Seir; and they shall be afraid of you: take ye good heed unto yourselves therefore:  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>Meddle not with them; for I will not give you of their land, no, not so much as a footbreadth; because I have given mount Seir unto Esau <span class='add'>for</span> a possession.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>Ye shall buy meat of them for money, that ye may eat; and ye shall also buy water of them for money, that ye may drink.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>For the LORD thy God hath blessed thee in all the works of thy hand: he knoweth thy walking through this great wilderness: these forty years the LORD thy God <span class='add'>hath been</span> with thee; thou hast lacked nothing.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>And when we passed by from our brethren the children of Esau, which dwelt in Seir, through the way of the plain from Elath, and from Ezion-gaber, we turned and passed by the way of the wilderness of Moab.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>And the LORD said unto me, Distress not the Moabites, neither contend with them in battle: for I will not give thee of their land <span class='add'>for</span> a possession; because I have given Ar unto the children of Lot <span class='add'>for</span> a possession.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>The Emims dwelt therein in times past, a people great, and many, and tall, as the Anakims;  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>Which also were accounted giants, as the Anakims; but the Moabites call them Emims.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>The Horims also dwelt in Seir beforetime; but the children of Esau succeeded them, when they had destroyed them from before them, and dwelt in their stead; as Israel did unto the land of his possession, which the LORD gave unto them.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>Now rise up, <span class='add'>said I</span>, and get you over the brook Zered. And we went over the brook Zered.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>And the space in which we came from Kadesh-barnea, until we were come over the brook Zered, <span class='add'>was</span> thirty and eight years; until all the generation of the men of war were wasted out from among the host, as the LORD sware unto them.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>For indeed the hand of the LORD was against them, to destroy them from among the host, until they were consumed. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>So it came to pass, when all the men of war were consumed and dead from among the people,  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>That the LORD spake unto me, saying,  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>Thou art to pass over through Ar, the coast of Moab, this day:  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>And <span class='add'>when</span> thou comest nigh over against the children of Ammon, distress them not, nor meddle with them: for I will not give thee of the land of the children of Ammon <span class='add'>any</span> possession; because I have given it unto the children of Lot <span class='add'>for</span> a possession.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>(That also was accounted a land of giants: giants dwelt therein in old time; and the Ammonites call them Zamzummims;  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>A people great, and many, and tall, as the Anakims; but the LORD destroyed them before them; and they succeeded them, and dwelt in their stead:  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>As he did to the children of Esau, which dwelt in Seir, when he destroyed the Horims from before them; and they succeeded them, and dwelt in their stead even unto this day:  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>And the Avims which dwelt in Hazerim, <span class='add'>even</span> unto Azzah, the Caphtorims, which came forth out of Caphtor, destroyed them, and dwelt in their stead.) </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>Rise ye up, take your journey, and pass over the river Arnon: behold, I have given into thine hand Sihon the Amorite, king of Heshbon, and his land: begin to possess <span class='add'>it</span>, and contend with him in battle.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>This day will I begin to put the dread of thee and the fear of thee upon the nations <span class='add'>that are</span> under the whole heaven, who shall hear report of thee, and shall tremble, and be in anguish because of thee. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>And I sent messengers out of the wilderness of Kedemoth unto Sihon king of Heshbon with words of peace, saying,  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>Let me pass through thy land: I will go along by the high way, I will neither turn unto the right hand nor to the left.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&nbsp;</span>Thou shalt sell me meat for money, that I may eat; and give me water for money, that I may drink: only I will pass through on my feet;  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&nbsp;</span>(As the children of Esau which dwell in Seir, and the Moabites which dwell in Ar, did unto me;) until I shall pass over Jordan into the land which the LORD our God giveth us.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&nbsp;</span>But Sihon king of Heshbon would not let us pass by him: for the LORD thy God hardened his spirit, and made his heart obstinate, that he might deliver him into thy hand, as <span class='add'>appeareth</span> this day.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&nbsp;</span>And the LORD said unto me, Behold, I have begun to give Sihon and his land before thee: begin to possess, that thou mayest inherit his land.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&nbsp;</span>Then Sihon came out against us, he and all his people, to fight at Jahaz.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&nbsp;</span>And the LORD our God delivered him before us; and we smote him, and his sons, and all his people.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&nbsp;</span>And we took all his cities at that time, and utterly destroyed the men, and the women, and the little ones, of every city, we left none to remain:  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&nbsp;</span>Only the cattle we took for a prey unto ourselves, and the spoil of the cities which we took.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&nbsp;</span>From Aroer, which <span class='add'>is</span> by the brink of the river of Arnon, and <span class='add'>from</span> the city that <span class='add'>is</span> by the river, even unto Gilead, there was not one city too strong for us: the LORD our God delivered all unto us:  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&nbsp;</span>Only unto the land of the children of Ammon thou camest not, nor unto any place of the river Jabbok, <span class='add'>nor</span> unto the cities in the mountains, nor unto whatsoever the LORD our God forbad us. </div><ul class='tnav'>
