 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C20V1">&nbsp;</a>And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C20V2">&nbsp;</a>Again, thou shalt say to the children of Israel, Whosoever
<span class="add">he be</span> of the children of Israel, or of the strangers that sojourn in Israel, that giveth
<span class="add">any</span> of his seed unto Molech; he shall surely be put to death: the people of the land shall stone him with
stones.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C20V3">&nbsp;</a>And I will set my face against that man, and will cut him off from among his people; because he hath
given of his seed unto Molech, to defile my sanctuary, and to profane my holy name.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C20V4">&nbsp;</a>And if the people of the land do any ways hide their eyes from the man, when he giveth of his seed unto
Molech, and kill him not:
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C20V5">&nbsp;</a>Then I will set my face against that man, and against his family, and will cut him off, and all that
go a whoring after him, to commit whoredom with Molech, from among their people.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C20V6">&nbsp;</a>And the soul that turneth after such as have familiar spirits, and after wizards, to go a whoring after
them, I will even set my face against that soul, and will cut him off from among his people.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C20V7">&nbsp;</a>Sanctify yourselves therefore, and be ye holy: for I
<span class="add">am</span> the LORD your God.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C20V8">&nbsp;</a>And ye shall keep my statutes, and do them: I
<span class="add">am</span> the LORD which sanctify you.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C20V9">&nbsp;</a>For every one that curseth his father or his mother shall be surely put to death: he hath cursed his
father or his mother; his blood
<span class="add">shall be</span> upon him.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C20V10">&nbsp;</a>And the man that committeth adultery with
<span class="add">another</span> man’s wife,
<span class="add">even he</span> that committeth adultery with his neighbour’s wife, the adulterer and the adulteress shall surely be
put to death.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C20V11">&nbsp;</a>And the man that lieth with his father’s wife hath uncovered his father’s nakedness: both of them shall
surely be put to death; their blood
<span class="add">shall be</span> upon them.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C20V12">&nbsp;</a>And if a man lie with his daughter in law, both of them shall surely be put to death: they have wrought
confusion; their blood
<span class="add">shall be</span> upon them.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C20V13">&nbsp;</a>If a man also lie with mankind, as he lieth with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination:
they shall surely be put to death; their blood
<span class="add">shall be</span> upon them.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C20V14">&nbsp;</a>And if a man take a wife and her mother, it
<span class="add">is</span> wickedness: they shall be burnt with fire, both he and they; that there be no wickedness among you.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C20V15">&nbsp;</a>And if a man lie with a beast, he shall surely be put to death: and ye shall slay the beast.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C20V16">&nbsp;</a>And if a woman approach unto any beast, and lie down thereto, thou shalt kill the woman, and the beast:
they shall surely be put to death; their blood
<span class="add">shall be</span> upon them.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C20V17">&nbsp;</a>And if a man shall take his sister, his father’s daughter, or his mother’s daughter, and see her nakedness,
and she see his nakedness; it
<span class="add">is</span> a wicked thing; and they shall be cut off in the sight of their people: he hath uncovered his sister’s
nakedness; he shall bear his iniquity.
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C20V18">&nbsp;</a>And if a man shall lie with a woman having her sickness, and shall uncover her nakedness; he hath discovered
her fountain, and she hath uncovered the fountain of her blood: and both of them shall be cut off from
among their people.
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C20V19">&nbsp;</a>And thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy mother’s sister, nor of thy father’s sister: for he uncovereth
his near kin: they shall bear their iniquity.
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C20V20">&nbsp;</a>And if a man shall lie with his uncle’s wife, he hath uncovered his uncle’s nakedness: they shall bear
their sin; they shall die childless.
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C20V21">&nbsp;</a>And if a man shall take his brother’s wife, it
<span class="add">is</span> an unclean thing: he hath uncovered his brother’s nakedness; they shall be childless.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C20V22">&nbsp;</a>Ye shall therefore keep all my statutes, and all my judgments, and do them: that the land, whither I
bring you to dwell therein, spue you not out.
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C20V23">&nbsp;</a>And ye shall not walk in the manners of the nation, which I cast out before you: for they committed all
these things, and therefore I abhorred them.
 <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C20V24">&nbsp;</a>But I have said unto you, Ye shall inherit their land, and I will give it unto you to possess it, a land
that floweth with milk and honey: I
<span class="add">am</span> the LORD your God, which have separated you from
<span class="add">other</span> people.
 <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C20V25">&nbsp;</a>Ye shall therefore put difference between clean beasts and unclean, and between unclean fowls and clean:
and ye shall not make your souls abominable by beast, or by fowl, or by any manner of living thing that
creepeth on the ground, which I have separated from you as unclean.
 <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C20V26">&nbsp;</a>And ye shall be holy unto me: for I the LORD
<span class="add">am</span> holy, and have severed you from
<span class="add">other</span> people, that ye should be mine.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C20V27">&nbsp;</a>A man also or woman that hath a familiar spirit, or that is a wizard, shall surely be put to death: they
shall stone them with stones: their blood
<span class="add">shall be</span> upon them.
