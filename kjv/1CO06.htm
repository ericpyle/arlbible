 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C6V1">&nbsp;</a>Dare any of you, having a matter against another, go to law before the unjust, and not before the saints?
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C6V2">&nbsp;</a>Do ye not know that the saints shall judge the world? and if the world shall be judged by you, are ye
unworthy to judge the smallest matters?
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C6V3">&nbsp;</a>Know ye not that we shall judge angels? how much more things that pertain to this life?
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C6V4">&nbsp;</a>If then ye have judgments of things pertaining to this life, set them to judge who are least esteemed
in the church.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C6V5">&nbsp;</a>I speak to your shame. Is it so, that there is not a wise man among you? no, not one that shall be able
to judge between his brethren?
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C6V6">&nbsp;</a>But brother goeth to law with brother, and that before the unbelievers.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C6V7">&nbsp;</a>Now therefore there is utterly a fault among you, because ye go to law one with another. Why do ye not
rather take wrong? why do ye not rather
<span class="add">suffer yourselves to</span> be defrauded?
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C6V8">&nbsp;</a>Nay, ye do wrong, and defraud, and that
<span class="add">your</span> brethren.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C6V9">&nbsp;</a>Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived: neither fornicators,
nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind,
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C6V10">&nbsp;</a>Nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of
God.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C6V11">&nbsp;</a>And such were some of you: but ye are washed, but ye are sanctified, but ye are justified in the name
of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C6V12">&nbsp;</a>All things are lawful unto me, but all things are not expedient: all things are lawful for me, but I
will not be brought under the power of any.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C6V13">&nbsp;</a>Meats for the belly, and the belly for meats: but God shall destroy both it and them. Now the body
<span class="add">is</span> not for fornication, but for the Lord; and the Lord for the body.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C6V14">&nbsp;</a>And God hath both raised up the Lord, and will also raise up us by his own power.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C6V15">&nbsp;</a>Know ye not that your bodies are the members of Christ? shall I then take the members of Christ, and
make
<span class="add">them</span> the members of an harlot? God forbid.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C6V16">&nbsp;</a>What? know ye not that he which is joined to an harlot is one body? for two, saith he, shall be one flesh.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C6V17">&nbsp;</a>But he that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit.
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C6V18">&nbsp;</a>Flee fornication. Every sin that a man doeth is without the body; but he that committeth fornication
sinneth against his own body.
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C6V19">&nbsp;</a>What? know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost
<span class="add">which is</span> in you, which ye have of God, and ye are not your own?
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C6V20">&nbsp;</a>For ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are God’s.
