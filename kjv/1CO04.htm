 <span class="verse" id="V1">1&nbsp;</span> Let a man so account  of us, as of the ministers of Christ, and stewards of the mysteries of God.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span> Moreover it is required in stewards, that a man be found faithful.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span> But with me it is a very small thing that I should be judged of you, or of man’s judgment: yea, I judge not mine own self.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span> For I know nothing by myself; yet am I not hereby justified: but he that judgeth me is the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span> Therefore judge nothing before the time, until the Lord come, who both will bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and will make manifest the counsels of the hearts: and then shall every man have praise of God.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span> And these things, brethren, I have in a figure transferred to myself and <span class='add'>to</span> Apollos for your sakes; that ye might learn in us not to think <span class='add'>of men</span> above that which is written, that no one of you be puffed up for one against another.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span> For who maketh thee to differ <span class='add'>from another</span>? and what hast thou that thou didst not receive? now if thou didst receive <span class='add'>it</span>, why dost thou glory, as if thou hadst not received <span class='add'>it</span>?  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span> Now ye are full, now ye are rich, ye have reigned as kings without us: and I would to God ye did reign, that we also might reign with you.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span> For I think that God hath set forth us the apostles last, as it were appointed to death: for we are made a spectacle unto the world, and to angels, and to men.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span> We <span class='add'>are</span> fools for Christ’s sake, but ye <span class='add'>are</span> wise in Christ; we <span class='add'>are</span> weak, but ye <span class='add'>are</span> strong; ye <span class='add'>are</span> honourable, but we <span class='add'>are</span> despised.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span> Even unto this present hour we both hunger, and thirst, and are naked, and are buffeted, and have no certain dwellingplace;  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span> And labour, working with our own hands: being reviled, we bless; being persecuted, we suffer it:  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span> Being defamed, we intreat: we are made as the filth of the world, <span class='add'>and are</span> the offscouring of all things unto this day.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span> I write not these things to shame you, but as my beloved sons I warn <span class='add'>you</span>.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span> For though ye have ten thousand instructers in Christ, yet <span class='add'>have ye</span> not many fathers: for in Christ Jesus I have begotten you through the gospel.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span> Wherefore I beseech you, be ye followers of me.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span> For this cause have I sent unto you Timotheus, who is my beloved son, and faithful in the Lord, who shall bring you into remembrance of my ways which be in Christ, as I teach every where in every church.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span> Now some are puffed up, as though I would not come to you.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span> But I will come to you shortly, if the Lord will, and will know, not the speech of them which are puffed up, but the power.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span> For the kingdom of God <span class='add'>is</span> not in word, but in power.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span> What will ye? shall I come unto you with a rod, or in love, and <span class='add'>in</span> the spirit of meekness? </div><ul class='tnav'>
