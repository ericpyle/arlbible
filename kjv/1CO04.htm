 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C4V1">&nbsp;</a>Let a man so account of us, as of the ministers of Christ, and stewards of the mysteries of God.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C4V2">&nbsp;</a>Moreover it is required in stewards, that a man be found faithful.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C4V3">&nbsp;</a>But with me it is a very small thing that I should be judged of you, or of man’s judgment: yea, I judge
not mine own self.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C4V4">&nbsp;</a>For I know nothing by myself; yet am I not hereby justified: but he that judgeth me is the Lord.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C4V5">&nbsp;</a>Therefore judge nothing before the time, until the Lord come, who both will bring to light the hidden
things of darkness, and will make manifest the counsels of the hearts: and then shall every man have
praise of God.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C4V6">&nbsp;</a>And these things, brethren, I have in a figure transferred to myself and
<span class="add">to</span> Apollos for your sakes; that ye might learn in us not to think
<span class="add">of men</span> above that which is written, that no one of you be puffed up for one against another.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C4V7">&nbsp;</a>For who maketh thee to differ
<span class="add">from another?</span> and what hast thou that thou didst not receive? now if thou didst receive
<span class="add">it,</span> why dost thou glory, as if thou hadst not received
<span class="add">it?
</span> <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C4V8">&nbsp;</a>Now ye are full, now ye are rich, ye have reigned as kings without us: and I would to God ye did reign,
that we also might reign with you.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C4V9">&nbsp;</a>For I think that God hath set forth us the apostles last, as it were appointed to death: for we are made
a spectacle unto the world, and to angels, and to men.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C4V10">&nbsp;</a>We
<span class="add">are</span> fools for Christ’s sake, but ye
<span class="add">are</span> wise in Christ; we
<span class="add">are</span> weak, but ye
<span class="add">are</span> strong; ye
<span class="add">are</span> honourable, but we
<span class="add">are</span> despised.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C4V11">&nbsp;</a>Even unto this present hour we both hunger, and thirst, and are naked, and are buffeted, and have no
certain dwellingplace;
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C4V12">&nbsp;</a>And labour, working with our own hands: being reviled, we bless; being persecuted, we suffer it:
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C4V13">&nbsp;</a>Being defamed, we intreat: we are made as the filth of the world,
<span class="add">and are</span> the offscouring of all things unto this day.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C4V14">&nbsp;</a>I write not these things to shame you, but as my beloved sons I warn
<span class="add">you.
</span> <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C4V15">&nbsp;</a>For though ye have ten thousand instructers in Christ, yet
<span class="add">have ye</span> not many fathers: for in Christ Jesus I have begotten you through the gospel.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C4V16">&nbsp;</a>Wherefore I beseech you, be ye followers of me.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C4V17">&nbsp;</a>For this cause have I sent unto you Timotheus, who is my beloved son, and faithful in the Lord, who shall
bring you into remembrance of my ways which be in Christ, as I teach every where in every church.
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C4V18">&nbsp;</a>Now some are puffed up, as though I would not come to you.
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C4V19">&nbsp;</a>But I will come to you shortly, if the Lord will, and will know, not the speech of them which are puffed
up, but the power.
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C4V20">&nbsp;</a>For the kingdom of God
<span class="add">is</span> not in word, but in power.
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C4V21">&nbsp;</a>What will ye? shall I come unto you with a rod, or in love, and
<span class="add">in</span> the spirit of meekness?
