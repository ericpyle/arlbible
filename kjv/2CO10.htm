 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C10V1">&nbsp;</a>Now I Paul myself beseech you by the meekness and gentleness of Christ, who in presence
<span class="add">am</span> base among you, but being absent am bold toward you:
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C10V2">&nbsp;</a>But I beseech
<span class="add">you,</span> that I may not be bold when I am present with that confidence, wherewith I think to be bold against
some, which think of us as if we walked according to the flesh.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C10V3">&nbsp;</a>For though we walk in the flesh, we do not war after the flesh:
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C10V4">&nbsp;</a>(For the weapons of our warfare
<span class="add">are</span> not carnal, but mighty through God to the pulling down of strong holds;)
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C10V5">&nbsp;</a>Casting down imaginations, and every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God, and
bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ;
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C10V6">&nbsp;</a>And having in a readiness to revenge all disobedience, when your obedience is fulfilled.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C10V7">&nbsp;</a>Do ye look on things after the outward appearance? If any man trust to himself that he is Christ’s, let
him of himself think this again, that, as he
<span class="add">is</span> Christ’s, even so
<span class="add">are</span> we Christ’s.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C10V8">&nbsp;</a>For though I should boast somewhat more of our authority, which the Lord hath given us for edification,
and not for your destruction, I should not be ashamed:
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C10V9">&nbsp;</a>That I may not seem as if I would terrify you by letters.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C10V10">&nbsp;</a>For
<span class="add">his</span> letters, say they,
<span class="add">are</span> weighty and powerful; but
<span class="add">his</span> bodily presence
<span class="add">is</span> weak, and
<span class="add">his</span> speech contemptible.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C10V11">&nbsp;</a>Let such an one think this, that, such as we are in word by letters when we are absent, such
<span class="add">will we be</span> also in deed when we are present.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C10V12">&nbsp;</a>For we dare not make ourselves of the number, or compare ourselves with some that commend themselves:
but they measuring themselves by themselves, and comparing themselves among themselves, are not wise.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C10V13">&nbsp;</a>But we will not boast of things without
<span class="add">our</span> measure, but according to the measure of the rule which God hath distributed to us, a measure to reach
even unto you.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C10V14">&nbsp;</a>For we stretch not ourselves beyond
<span class="add">our measure,</span> as though we reached not unto you: for we are come as far as to you also in
<span class="add">preaching</span> the gospel of Christ:
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C10V15">&nbsp;</a>Not boasting of things without
<span class="add">our</span> measure,
<span class="add">that is,</span> of other men’s labours; but having hope, when your faith is increased, that we shall be enlarged by
you according to our rule abundantly,
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C10V16">&nbsp;</a>To preach the gospel in the
<span class="add">regions</span> beyond you,
<span class="add">and</span> not to boast in another man’s line of things made ready to our hand.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C10V17">&nbsp;</a>But he that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord.
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C10V18">&nbsp;</a>For not he that commendeth himself is approved, but whom the Lord commendeth.
