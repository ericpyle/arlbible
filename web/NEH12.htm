</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C12V22">&nbsp;</a>As for the Levites, in the days of Eliashib, Joiada, and Johanan, and Jaddua, there were recorded the
heads of fathers’ households; also the priests, in the reign of Darius the Persian.
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C12V23">&nbsp;</a>The sons of Levi, heads of fathers’ households, were written in the book of the chronicles, even until
the days of Johanan the son of Eliashib.
 <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C12V24">&nbsp;</a>The chiefs of the Levites: Hashabiah, Sherebiah, and Jeshua the son of Kadmiel, with their brothers close
to them, to praise and give thanks, according to the commandment of David the man of God, watch next
to watch.
 <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C12V25">&nbsp;</a>Mattaniah, and Bakbukiah, Obadiah, Meshullam, Talmon, Akkub, were gatekeepers keeping the watch at the
storehouses of the gates.
 <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C12V26">&nbsp;</a>These were in the days of Joiakim the son of Jeshua, the son of Jozadak, and in the days of Nehemiah
the governor, and of Ezra the priest and scribe.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C12V27">&nbsp;</a>At the dedication of the wall of Jerusalem, they sought the Levites out of all their places, to bring
them to Jerusalem, to keep the dedication with gladness, both with giving thanks, and with singing, with
cymbals, stringed instruments, and with harps.
 <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C12V28">&nbsp;</a>The sons of the singers gathered themselves together, both out of the plain around Jerusalem and from
the villages of the Netophathites;
 <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C12V29">&nbsp;</a>also from Beth Gilgal, and out of the fields of Geba and Azmaveth: for the singers had built themselves
villages around Jerusalem.
 <span class="verse"> 30</span><a name="C12V30">&nbsp;</a>The priests and the Levites purified themselves; and they purified the people, and the gates, and the
wall.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 31</span><a name="C12V31">&nbsp;</a>Then I brought up the princes of Judah on the wall, and appointed two great companies who gave thanks
and went in procession. One went on the right hand on the wall toward the dung gate;
 <span class="verse"> 32</span><a name="C12V32">&nbsp;</a>and after them went Hoshaiah, with half of the princes of Judah,
 <span class="verse"> 33</span><a name="C12V33">&nbsp;</a>and Azariah, Ezra, and Meshullam,
 <span class="verse"> 34</span><a name="C12V34">&nbsp;</a>Judah, Benjamin, Shemaiah, Jeremiah,
 <span class="verse"> 35</span><a name="C12V35">&nbsp;</a>and some of the priests’ sons with trumpets: Zechariah the son of Jonathan, the son of Shemaiah, the
son of Mattaniah, the son of Micaiah, the son of Zaccur, the son of Asaph;
 <span class="verse"> 36</span><a name="C12V36">&nbsp;</a>and his brothers, Shemaiah, Azarel, Milalai, Gilalai, Maai, Nethanel, Judah, and Hanani, with the musical
instruments of David the man of God; and Ezra the scribe was before them.
 <span class="verse"> 37</span><a name="C12V37">&nbsp;</a>By the spring gate, and straight before them, they went up by the stairs of David’s city, at the ascent
of the wall, above David’s house, even to the water gate eastward.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 38</span><a name="C12V38">&nbsp;</a>The other company of those who gave thanks went to meet them, and I after them, with the half of the
people, on the wall, above the tower of the furnaces, even to the wide wall,
 <span class="verse"> 39</span><a name="C12V39">&nbsp;</a>and above the gate of Ephraim, and by the old gate, and by the fish gate, and the tower of Hananel, and
the tower of Hammeah, even to the sheep gate: and they stood still in the gate of the guard.
 <span class="verse"> 40</span><a name="C12V40">&nbsp;</a>So the two companies of those who gave thanks in God’s house stood, and I, and the half of the rulers
with me;
 <span class="verse"> 41</span><a name="C12V41">&nbsp;</a>and the priests, Eliakim, Maaseiah, Miniamin, Micaiah, Elioenai, Zechariah, and Hananiah, with trumpets;
 <span class="verse"> 42</span><a name="C12V42">&nbsp;</a>and Maaseiah, Shemaiah, Eleazar, Uzzi, Jehohanan, Malchijah, Elam, and Ezer. The singers sang loud, with
Jezrahiah their overseer.
 <span class="verse"> 43</span><a name="C12V43">&nbsp;</a>They offered great sacrifices that day, and rejoiced; for God had made them rejoice with great joy; and
the women and the children also rejoiced; so that the joy of Jerusalem was heard even far away.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 44</span><a name="C12V44">&nbsp;</a>On that day were men appointed over the rooms for the treasures, for the wave offerings, for the first
fruits, and for the tithes, to gather into them, according to the fields of the cities, the portions
appointed by the law for the priests and Levites; for Judah rejoiced for the priests and for the Levites
who waited.
 <span class="verse"> 45</span><a name="C12V45">&nbsp;</a>They performed the duty of their God, and the duty of the purification, and so did the singers and the
gatekeepers, according to the commandment of David, and of Solomon his son.
 <span class="verse"> 46</span><a name="C12V46">&nbsp;</a>For in the days of David and Asaph of old there was a chief of the singers, and songs of praise and thanksgiving
to God.
 <span class="verse"> 47</span><a name="C12V47">&nbsp;</a>All Israel in the days of Zerubbabel, and in the days of Nehemiah, gave the portions of the singers and
the gatekeepers, as every day required; and they set apart that which was for the Levites; and the Levites
set apart that which was for the sons of Aaron.
