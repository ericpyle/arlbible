 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C16V1">&nbsp;</a>When the Sabbath was past, Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James, and Salome, bought spices, that
they might come and anoint him.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C16V2">&nbsp;</a>Very early on the first day of the week, they came to the tomb when the sun had risen.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C16V3">&nbsp;</a>They were saying among themselves, “Who will roll away the stone from the door of the tomb for us?”
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C16V4">&nbsp;</a>for it was very big. Looking up, they saw that the stone was rolled back.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C16V5">&nbsp;</a>Entering into the tomb, they saw a young man sitting on the right side, dressed in a white robe, and
they were amazed.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C16V6">&nbsp;</a>He said to them, “Don’t be amazed. You seek Jesus, the Nazarene, who has been crucified. He has risen.
He is not here. Behold, the place where they laid him!
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C16V7">&nbsp;</a>But go, tell his disciples and Peter, ‘He goes before you into Galilee. There you will see him, as he
said to you.’”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C16V8">&nbsp;</a>They went out,<a href="#FN1"><span class="notemark">*</span><span class="popup">TR adds “quickly”</span></a>
 and fled from the tomb, for trembling and astonishment had come on them. They said nothing to anyone;
for they were afraid.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C16V9">&nbsp;</a><a href="#FN2"><span class="notemark">†</span><span class="popup">NU includes the text of verses 9-20, but mentions in a footnote that a few manuscripts omitted it. The
translators of the World English Bible regard Mark 16:9-20 as reliable based on an overwhelming majority
of textual evidence, including not only the authoritative Greek Majority Text New Testament, but also
the TR and many of the manuscripts cited in the NU text.</span></a>
Now when he had risen early on the first day of the week, he appeared first to Mary Magdalene, from whom
he had cast out seven demons.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C16V10">&nbsp;</a>She went and told those who had been with him, as they mourned and wept.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C16V11">&nbsp;</a>When they heard that he was alive, and had been seen by her, they disbelieved.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C16V12">&nbsp;</a>After these things he was revealed in another form to two of them, as they walked, on their way into
the country.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C16V13">&nbsp;</a>They went away and told it to the rest. They didn’t believe them, either.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C16V14">&nbsp;</a>Afterward he was revealed to the eleven themselves as they sat at the table, and he rebuked them for
their unbelief and hardness of heart, because they didn’t believe those who had seen him after he had
risen.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C16V15">&nbsp;</a>He said to them,
<span class="wj">“Go into all the world, and preach the Good News to the whole creation.
</span> <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C16V16">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">He who believes and is baptized will be saved; but he who disbelieves will be condemned.
</span> <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C16V17">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">These signs will accompany those who believe: in my name they will cast out demons; they will speak with
new languages;
</span> <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C16V18">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">they will take up serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing, it will in no way hurt them; they will
lay hands on the sick, and they will recover.”</span></div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C16V19">&nbsp;</a>So then the Lord,<a href="#FN3"><span class="notemark">‡</span><span class="popup">NA adds “Jesus”</span></a>
 after he had spoken to them, was received up into heaven, and sat down at the right hand of God.
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C16V20">&nbsp;</a>They went out, and preached everywhere, the Lord working with them, and confirming the word by the signs
that followed. Amen.
