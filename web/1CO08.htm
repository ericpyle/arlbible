 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C8V1">&nbsp;</a>Now concerning things sacrificed to idols: We know that we all have knowledge. Knowledge puffs up, but
love builds up.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C8V2">&nbsp;</a>But if anyone thinks that he knows anything, he doesn’t yet know as he ought to know.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C8V3">&nbsp;</a>But if anyone loves God, the same is known by him.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C8V4">&nbsp;</a>Therefore concerning the eating of things sacrificed to idols, we know that no idol is anything in the
world, and that there is no other God but one.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C8V5">&nbsp;</a>For though there are things that are called “gods”, whether in the heavens or on earth; as there are
many “gods” and many “lords”;
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C8V6">&nbsp;</a>yet to us there is one God, the Father, of whom are all things, and we for him; and one Lord, Jesus Christ,
through whom are all things, and we live through him.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C8V7">&nbsp;</a>However, that knowledge isn’t in all men. But some, with consciousness of the idol until now, eat as
of a thing sacrificed to an idol, and their conscience, being weak, is defiled.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C8V8">&nbsp;</a>But food will not commend us to God. For neither, if we don’t eat, are we the worse; nor, if we eat,
are we the better.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C8V9">&nbsp;</a>But be careful that by no means does this liberty of yours become a stumbling block to the weak.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C8V10">&nbsp;</a>For if a man sees you who have knowledge sitting in an idol’s temple, won’t his conscience, if he is
weak, be emboldened to eat things sacrificed to idols?
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C8V11">&nbsp;</a>And through your knowledge, he who is weak perishes, the brother for whose sake Christ died.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C8V12">&nbsp;</a>Thus, sinning against the brothers, and wounding their conscience when it is weak, you sin against Christ.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C8V13">&nbsp;</a>Therefore if food causes my brother to stumble, I will eat no meat forever more, that I don’t cause my
brother to stumble.
