<div class="mt1">Paul’s Second Letter to Timothy
</div>
<div class="chapterlabel"> 1</div><div class="p">
 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C1V1">&nbsp;</a>Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ through the will of God, according to the promise of the life which
is in Christ Jesus,
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C1V2">&nbsp;</a>to Timothy, my beloved child: Grace, mercy, and peace, from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C1V3">&nbsp;</a>I thank God, whom I serve as my forefathers did, with a pure conscience. How unceasing is my memory of
you in my petitions, night and day
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C1V4">&nbsp;</a>longing to see you, remembering your tears, that I may be filled with joy;
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C1V5">&nbsp;</a>having been reminded of the sincere faith that is in you; which lived first in your grandmother Lois,
and your mother Eunice, and, I am persuaded, in you also.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C1V6">&nbsp;</a>For this cause, I remind you that you should stir up the gift of God which is in you through the laying
on of my hands.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C1V7">&nbsp;</a>For God didn’t give us a spirit of fear, but of power, love, and self-control.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C1V8">&nbsp;</a>Therefore don’t be ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me his prisoner; but endure hardship
for the Good News according to the power of God,
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C1V9">&nbsp;</a>who saved us and called us with a holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own
purpose and grace, which was given to us in Christ Jesus before times eternal,
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C1V10">&nbsp;</a>but has now been revealed by the appearing of our Savior, Christ Jesus, who abolished death, and brought
life and immortality to light through the Good News.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C1V11">&nbsp;</a>For this, I was appointed as a preacher, an apostle, and a teacher of the Gentiles.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C1V12">&nbsp;</a>For this cause I also suffer these things.
</div>
<div class="p">Yet I am not ashamed, for I know him whom I have believed, and I am persuaded that he is able to guard
that which I have committed to him against that day.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C1V13">&nbsp;</a>Hold the pattern of sound words which you have heard from me, in faith and love which is in Christ Jesus.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C1V14">&nbsp;</a>That good thing which was committed to you, guard through the Holy Spirit who dwells in us.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C1V15">&nbsp;</a>This you know, that all who are in Asia turned away from me; of whom are Phygelus and Hermogenes.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C1V16">&nbsp;</a>May the Lord grant mercy to the house of Onesiphorus, for he often refreshed me, and was not ashamed
of my chain,
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C1V17">&nbsp;</a>but when he was in Rome, he sought me diligently, and found me
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C1V18">&nbsp;</a>(the Lord grant to him to find the Lord’s mercy in that day); and in how many things he served at Ephesus,
you know very well.
