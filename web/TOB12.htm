 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C12V1">&nbsp;</a>And Tobit called his son Tobias, and said to him, See, my child, that the man which went with you have
his wages, and you must give him more.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C12V2">&nbsp;</a>And he said to him, Father, it is no harm to me to give him the half of those things which I have brought:
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C12V3">&nbsp;</a>for he has led me for you in safety, and he cured my wife, and brought my money, and likewise cured you.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C12V4">&nbsp;</a>And the old man said, It is due to him.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C12V5">&nbsp;</a>And he called the angel, and said to him, Take the half of all that you⌃ have brought.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C12V6">&nbsp;</a>Then he called them both privily, and said to them,
</div>
<div class="p">Bless God, and give him thanks, and magnify him, and give him thanks in the sight of all that live, for
the things which he has done with you. It is good to bless God and exalt his name, showing forth with
honor the works of God; and be not slack to give him thanks.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C12V7">&nbsp;</a>It is good to keep close the secret of a king, but to reveal gloriously the works of God. Do good, and
evil shall not find you.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C12V8">&nbsp;</a>Good is prayer with fasting and alms and righteousness. A little with righteousness is better than much
with unrighteousness. It is better to give alms than to lay up gold:
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C12V9">&nbsp;</a>alms does deliver from death, and it shall purge away all sin. They that do alms and righteousness shall
be filled with life;
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C12V10">&nbsp;</a>but they that sin are enemies to their own life.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C12V11">&nbsp;</a>Surely I will keep close nothing from you. I have said, It is good to keep close the secret of a king,
but to reveal gloriously the works of God.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C12V12">&nbsp;</a>And now, when you did pray, and Sarah your daughter in law, I did bring the memorial of your prayer before
the Holy One: and when you did bury the dead, I was with you likewise.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C12V13">&nbsp;</a>And when you did not delay to rise up, and leave your dinner, that you might go and cover the dead, your
good deed was not hid from me: but I was with you.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C12V14">&nbsp;</a>And now God did send me to heal you and Sarah your daughter in law.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C12V15">&nbsp;</a>I am Raphael, one of the seven holy angels, which present the prayers of the saints, and go in before
the glory of the Holy One.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C12V16">&nbsp;</a>And they were both troubled, and fell upon their faces; for they were afraid.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C12V17">&nbsp;</a>And he said to them, Be not afraid, you⌃ shall have peace; but bless God for ever.
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C12V18">&nbsp;</a>For not of any favor of mine, but by the will of your God I came; wherefore bless him for ever.
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C12V19">&nbsp;</a>All these days did I appear to you; and I did neither eat nor drink, but you⌃ saw a vision.
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C12V20">&nbsp;</a>And now give God thanks: because I ascend to him that sent me: and write in a book all the things which
have been done.
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C12V21">&nbsp;</a>And they rose up, and saw him no more.
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C12V22">&nbsp;</a>And they confessed the great and wonderful works of God, and how the angel of the Lord had appeared to
them.
