 our hope;
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C1V2">&nbsp;</a>to Timothy, my true child in faith: Grace, mercy, and peace, from God our Father and Christ Jesus our
Lord.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C1V3">&nbsp;</a>As I urged you when I was going into Macedonia, stay at Ephesus that you might command certain men not
to teach a different doctrine,
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C1V4">&nbsp;</a>and not to pay attention to myths and endless genealogies, which cause disputes, rather than God’s stewardship,
which is in faith—
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C1V5">&nbsp;</a>but the goal of this command is love, out of a pure heart and a good conscience and sincere faith;
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C1V6">&nbsp;</a>from which things some, having missed the mark, have turned aside to vain talking;
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C1V7">&nbsp;</a>desiring to be teachers of the law, though they understand neither what they say, nor about what they
strongly affirm.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C1V8">&nbsp;</a>But we know that the law is good, if a person uses it lawfully,
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C1V9">&nbsp;</a>as knowing this, that law is not made for a righteous person, but for the lawless and insubordinate,
for the ungodly and sinners, for the unholy and profane, for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers,
for manslayers,
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C1V10">&nbsp;</a>for the sexually immoral, for homosexuals, for slave-traders, for liars, for perjurers, and for any other
thing contrary to the sound doctrine;
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C1V11">&nbsp;</a>according to the Good News of the glory of the blessed God, which was committed to my trust.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C1V12">&nbsp;</a>And I thank him who enabled me, Christ Jesus our Lord, because he counted me faithful, appointing me
to service;
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C1V13">&nbsp;</a>although I was before a blasphemer, a persecutor, and insolent. However, I obtained mercy, because I
did it ignorantly in unbelief.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C1V14">&nbsp;</a>The grace of our Lord abounded exceedingly with faith and love which is in Christ Jesus.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C1V15">&nbsp;</a>The saying is faithful and worthy of all acceptance, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners;
of whom I am chief.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C1V16">&nbsp;</a>However, for this cause I obtained mercy, that in me first, Jesus Christ might display all his patience,
for an example of those who were going to believe in him for eternal life.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C1V17">&nbsp;</a>Now to the King eternal, immortal, invisible, to God who alone is wise, be honor and glory forever and
ever. Amen.

<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C1V18">&nbsp;</a>This instruction I commit to you, my child Timothy, according to the prophecies which led the way to
you, that by them you may wage the good warfare;
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C1V19">&nbsp;</a>holding faith and a good conscience; which some having thrust away made a shipwreck concerning the faith;
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C1V20">&nbsp;</a>of whom is Hymenaeus and Alexander; whom I delivered to Satan, that they might be taught not to blaspheme.
