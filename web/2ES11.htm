 <span class="verse" id="V1">1&nbsp;</span>And it came to pass the second night that I saw a dream, and, behold, there came up from the sea an eagle, which had twelve feathered wings, and three heads.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span>And I saw, and, behold, she spread her wings over all the earth, and all the winds of heaven blew on her, <a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> So the chief Oriental versions.

and they became little wings and small.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>But her heads were at rest: the head in the midst was greater than the other heads, yet rested it with them.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>Moreover I saw, and, behold, the eagle flew with her wings, to reign over the earth, and over them that dwell therein.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>And I saw how all things under heaven were subject to her, and no man spoke against her, no, not one creature upon earth.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>And I saw, and, behold, the eagle rose upon her talons, and uttered her voice to her wings, saying,  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>Watch not all at once: sleep every one in his own place, and watch by course:  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>but let the heads be preserved for the last.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>And I saw, and, behold, the voice went not out of her heads, but from the midst of her body.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>And I counted <a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> The Syriac has her little wings, and, etc. </span></a> her wings that were near the other, and, behold, there were eight of them.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>And I saw, and, behold, on the right side there arose one wing, and reigned over all the earth;  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>and so it was, that when it reigned, the end of it came, and it appeared not, so that the place thereof appeared no more: and the next following rose up, and reigned, and it bare rule a great time;  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>and it happened, that when it reigned, the end of it came also, so that it appeared no more, like as the first.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>And, behold, there came a voice to it, and said,  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>Hear you that have borne rule over the earth all this time: this I proclaim to you, before you shall appear no more,  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>There shall none after you attain to your time, neither to the half thereof.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>Then arose the third, and had the rule as the others before, and it also appeared no more.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>So went it with all the wings one after another, as that every one bare rule, and then appeared no more.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>And I saw, and, behold, in process of time the <a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> The Syriac has little wings. </span></a> wings that followed were set up upon the <a href="#FN4" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> The Aethiopic has left. </span></a> right side, that they might rule also; and some of them ruled, but within a while they appeared no more:  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>some also of them were set up, but ruled not.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>After this I saw, and, behold, the twelve wings appeared no more, nor two of the little wings:  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>and there was no more left upon the eagle’s body, but the three heads that rested, and six little wings.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>And I saw, and, behold, two little wings divided themselves from the six, and remained under the head that was upon the right side: but four remained in their place.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>And I saw, and, behold, these <a href="#FN5" class="notemark">**<span class="popup"> The Syriac has little wings. </span></a> under wings thought to set up themselves, and to have the rule.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>And I saw, and, behold, there was one set up, but within a while it appeared no more.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>A second also, and it was sooner away than the first.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&nbsp;</span>And I saw, and, behold, the two that remained thought also in themselves to reign:  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&nbsp;</span>and while they so thought, behold, there awaked one of the heads that were at rest, <span class='add'>namely, it </span> that was in the midst; for that was greater than the two <span class='add'>other </span> heads.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&nbsp;</span>And I saw how it joined the two <span class='add'>other </span> heads with it.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&nbsp;</span>And, behold, the head was turned with them that were with it, and did eat up the two <a href="#FN6" class="notemark">††<span class="popup"> The Syriac has little wings. </span></a> under wings that thought to have reigned.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&nbsp;</span>But this head held the whole earth in possession, and bare rule over those that dwell therein with much oppression; and it had the governance of the world more than all the wings that had been.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&nbsp;</span>And after this I saw, and, behold, the head also that was in the midst suddenly appeared no more, like as the wings.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&nbsp;</span>But there remained the two heads, which also in like sort reigned over the earth, and over those that dwell therein.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&nbsp;</span>And I saw, and, behold, the head upon the right side devoured it that was upon the left side. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V36">36&nbsp;</span>Then I heard a voice, which said to me, Look before you, and consider the thing that you see.  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&nbsp;</span>And I saw, and, behold, as it were a lion roused out of the wood roaring: and I heard how that he sent out a man’s voice to the eagle, and spoke, saying,  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&nbsp;</span>Hear you, I will talk with you, and the Most High shall say to you,  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&nbsp;</span>Are not you it that remain of the four beasts, whom I made to reign in my world, that the end of my times might come through them?  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&nbsp;</span>And the fourth came, and overcame all the beasts that were past, and held the world in governance with great trembling, and the whole compass of the earth with grievous oppression;
