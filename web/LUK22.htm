 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C22V1">&nbsp;</a>Now the feast of unleavened bread, which is called the Passover, was approaching.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C22V2">&nbsp;</a>The chief priests and the scribes sought how they might put him to death, for they feared the people.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C22V3">&nbsp;</a>Satan entered into Judas, who was also called Iscariot, who was counted with the twelve.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C22V4">&nbsp;</a>He went away, and talked with the chief priests and captains about how he might deliver him to them.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C22V5">&nbsp;</a>They were glad, and agreed to give him money.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C22V6">&nbsp;</a>He consented, and sought an opportunity to deliver him to them in the absence of the multitude.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C22V7">&nbsp;</a>The day of unleavened bread came, on which the Passover must be sacrificed.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C22V8">&nbsp;</a>He sent Peter and John, saying,
<span class="wj">“Go and prepare the Passover for us, that we may eat.”</span></div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C22V9">&nbsp;</a>They said to him, “Where do you want us to prepare?”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C22V10">&nbsp;</a>He said to them,
<span class="wj">“Behold, when you have entered into the city, a man carrying a pitcher of water will meet you. Follow
him into the house which he enters.
</span> <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C22V11">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Tell the master of the house, ‘The Teacher says to you, “Where is the guest room, where I may eat the
Passover with my disciples?”’
</span> <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C22V12">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">He will show you a large, furnished upper room. Make preparations there.”</span></div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C22V13">&nbsp;</a>They went, found things as he had told them, and they prepared the Passover.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C22V14">&nbsp;</a>When the hour had come, he sat down with the twelve apostles.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C22V15">&nbsp;</a>He said to them,
<span class="wj">“I have earnestly desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer,
</span> <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C22V16">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">for I tell you, I will no longer by any means eat of it until it is fulfilled in God’s Kingdom.”</span> <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C22V17">&nbsp;</a>He received a cup, and when he had given thanks, he said,
<span class="wj">“Take this, and share it among yourselves,
</span> <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C22V18">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">for I tell you, I will not drink at all again from the fruit of the vine, until God’s Kingdom comes.”</span></div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C22V19">&nbsp;</a>He took bread, and when he had given thanks, he broke it, and gave to them, saying,
<span class="wj">“This is my body which is given for you. Do this in memory of me.”</span> <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C22V20">&nbsp;</a>Likewise, he took the cup after supper, saying,
<span class="wj">“This cup is the new covenant in my blood, which is poured out for you.
</span> <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C22V21">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">But behold, the hand of him who betrays me is with me on the table.
</span> <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C22V22">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">The Son of Man indeed goes, as it has been determined, but woe to that man through whom he is betrayed!”</span></div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C22V23">&nbsp;</a>They began to question among themselves, which of them it was who would do this thing.
 <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C22V24">&nbsp;</a>There arose also a contention among them, which of them was considered to be greatest.
 <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C22V25">&nbsp;</a>He said to them,
<span class="wj">“The kings of the nations lord it over them, and those who have authority over them are called ‘benefactors.’
</span> <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C22V26">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">But not so with you. But one who is the greater among you, let him become as the younger, and one who
is governing, as one who serves.
</span> <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C22V27">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">For who is greater, one who sits at the table, or one who serves? Isn’t it he who sits at the table?
But I am among you as one who serves.
</span> <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C22V28">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">But you are those who have continued with me in my trials.
</span> <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C22V29">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">I confer on you a kingdom, even as my Father conferred on me,
</span> <span class="verse"> 30</span><a name="C22V30">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">that you may eat and drink at my table in my Kingdom. You will sit on thrones, judging the twelve tribes
of Israel.”</span></div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 31</span><a name="C22V31">&nbsp;</a>The Lord said,
<span class="wj">“Simon, Simon, behold, Satan asked to have you, that he might sift you as wheat,
</span> <span class="verse"> 32</span><a name="C22V32">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">but I prayed for you, that your faith wouldn’t fail. You, when once you have turned again, establish
your brothers.”</span><a href="#FN1"><span class="notemark">*</span><span class="popup">The word for “brothers” here may be also correctly translated “brothers and sisters” or “siblings.”</span></a>
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 33</span><a name="C22V33">&nbsp;</a>He said to him, “Lord, I am ready to go with you both to prison and to death!”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 34</span><a name="C22V34">&nbsp;</a>He said,
<span class="wj">“I tell you, Peter, the rooster will by no means crow today until you deny that you know me three times.”</span></div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 35</span><a name="C22V35">&nbsp;</a>He said to them,
<span class="wj">“When I sent you out without purse, and wallet, and shoes, did you lack anything?”</span></div>
<div class="p">They said, “Nothing.”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 36</span><a name="C22V36">&nbsp;</a>Then he said to them,
<span class="wj">“But now, whoever has a purse, let him take it, and likewise a wallet. Whoever has none, let him sell
his cloak, and buy a sword.
</span> <span class="verse"> 37</span><a name="C22V37">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">For I tell you that this which is written must still be fulfilled in me: ‘He was counted with transgressors.’</span><a href="#FN2"><span class="notemark"></span><span class="popup">+ Isaiah 53:12</span></a>
<span class="wj">For that which concerns me has an end.”</span></div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 38</span><a name="C22V38">&nbsp;</a>They said, “Lord, behold, here are two swords.”
</div>
<div class="p">He said to them,
<span class="wj">“That is enough.”</span></div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 39</span><a name="C22V39">&nbsp;</a>He came out, and went, as his custom was, to the Mount of Olives. His disciples also followed him.
 <span class="verse"> 40</span><a name="C22V40">&nbsp;</a>When he was at the place, he said to them,
<span class="wj">“Pray that you don’t enter into temptation.”</span></div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 41</span><a name="C22V41">&nbsp;</a>He was withdrawn from them about a stone’s throw, and he knelt down and prayed,
 <span class="verse"> 42</span><a name="C22V42">&nbsp;</a>saying,
<span class="wj">“Father, if you are willing, remove this cup from me. Nevertheless, not my will, but yours, be done.”</span></div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 43</span><a name="C22V43">&nbsp;</a>An angel from heaven appeared to him, strengthening him.
 <span class="verse"> 44</span><a name="C22V44">&nbsp;</a>Being in agony he prayed more earnestly. His sweat became like great drops of blood falling down on the
ground.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 45</span><a name="C22V45">&nbsp;</a>When he rose up from his prayer, he came to the disciples, and found them sleeping because of grief,
 <span class="verse"> 46</span><a name="C22V46">&nbsp;</a>and said to them,
<span class="wj">“Why do you sleep? Rise and pray that you may not enter into temptation.”</span></div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 47</span><a name="C22V47">&nbsp;</a>While he was still speaking, behold, a multitude, and he who was called Judas, one of the twelve, was
leading them. He came near to Jesus to kiss him.
 <span class="verse"> 48</span><a name="C22V48">&nbsp;</a>But Jesus said to him,
<span class="wj">“Judas, do you betray the Son of Man with a kiss?”</span></div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 49</span><a name="C22V49">&nbsp;</a>When those who were around him saw what was about to happen, they said to him, “Lord, shall we strike
with the sword?”
 <span class="verse"> 50</span><a name="C22V50">&nbsp;</a>A certain one of them struck the servant of the high priest, and cut off his right ear.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 51</span><a name="C22V51">&nbsp;</a>But Jesus answered,
<span class="wj">“Let me at least do this”</span>—and he touched his ear, and healed him.
 <span class="verse"> 52</span><a name="C22V52">&nbsp;</a>Jesus said to the chief priests, captains of the temple, and elders, who had come against him,
<span class="wj">“Have you come out as against a robber, with swords and clubs?
</span> <span class="verse"> 53</span><a name="C22V53">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">When I was with you in the temple daily, you didn’t stretch out your hands against me. But this is your
hour, and the power of darkness.”
</span></div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 54</span><a name="C22V54">&nbsp;</a>They seized him, and led him away, and brought him into the high priest’s house. But Peter followed from
a distance.
 <span class="verse"> 55</span><a name="C22V55">&nbsp;</a>When they had kindled a fire in the middle of the courtyard, and had sat down together, Peter sat among
them.
 <span class="verse"> 56</span><a name="C22V56">&nbsp;</a>A certain servant girl saw him as he sat in the light, and looking intently at him, said, “This man also
was with him.”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 57</span><a name="C22V57">&nbsp;</a>He denied Jesus, saying, “Woman, I don’t know him.”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 58</span><a name="C22V58">&nbsp;</a>After a little while someone else saw him, and said, “You also are one of them!”
</div>
<div class="p">But Peter answered, “Man, I am not!”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 59</span><a name="C22V59">&nbsp;</a>After about one hour passed, another confidently affirmed, saying, “Truly this man also was with him,
for he is a Galilean!”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 60</span><a name="C22V60">&nbsp;</a>But Peter said, “Man, I don’t know what you are talking about!” Immediately, while he was still speaking,
a rooster crowed.
 <span class="verse"> 61</span><a name="C22V61">&nbsp;</a>The Lord turned, and looked at Peter. Then Peter remembered the Lord’s word, how he said to him,
<span class="wj">“Before the rooster crows you will deny me three times.”</span> <span class="verse"> 62</span><a name="C22V62">&nbsp;</a>He went out, and wept bitterly.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 63</span><a name="C22V63">&nbsp;</a>The men who held Jesus mocked him and beat him.
 <span class="verse"> 64</span><a name="C22V64">&nbsp;</a>Having blindfolded him, they struck him on the face and asked him, “Prophesy! Who is the one who struck
you?”
 <span class="verse"> 65</span><a name="C22V65">&nbsp;</a>They spoke many other things against him, insulting him.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 66</span><a name="C22V66">&nbsp;</a>As soon as it was day, the assembly of the elders of the people was gathered together, both chief priests
and scribes, and they led him away into their council, saying,
 <span class="verse"> 67</span><a name="C22V67">&nbsp;</a>“If you are the Christ, tell us.”
</div>
<div class="p">But he said to them,
<span class="wj">“If I tell you, you won’t believe,
</span> <span class="verse"> 68</span><a name="C22V68">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">and if I ask, you will in no way answer me or let me go.
</span> <span class="verse"> 69</span><a name="C22V69">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">From now on, the Son of Man will be seated at the right hand of the power of God.”</span></div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 70</span><a name="C22V70">&nbsp;</a>They all said, “Are you then the Son of God?”
</div>
<div class="p">He said to them,
<span class="wj">“You say it, because I am.”</span></div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 71</span><a name="C22V71">&nbsp;</a>They said, “Why do we need any more witness? For we ourselves have heard from his own mouth!”
