 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C7V1">&nbsp;</a>And they came to Ecbatana, and arrived at the house of Raguel. But Sarah met them; and she saluted them,
and they her; and she brought them into the house.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C7V2">&nbsp;</a>And he said to Edna his wife, How like is the young man to Tobit my cousin.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C7V3">&nbsp;</a>And Raguel asked them, From whence are you⌃, brethren? And they said to him, We are of the sons of Naphtali,
which are captives in Nineveh.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C7V4">&nbsp;</a>And he said to them, Know you⌃ Tobit our brother? But they said, We know him. And he said to them, Is
he in good health?
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C7V5">&nbsp;</a>But they said, He is both alive, and in good health: and Tobias said, He is my father.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C7V6">&nbsp;</a>And Raguel sprang up, and kissed him, and wept,
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C7V7">&nbsp;</a>and blessed him, and said to him, You are the son of an honest and good man. And when he had heard that
Tobit had lost his sight, he was grieved, and wept;
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C7V8">&nbsp;</a>and Edna his wife and Sarah his daughter wept. And they received them gladly; and they killed a ram of
the flock, and set store of meat before them.

<div class="p">But Tobias said to Raphael, Brother Azarias, speak of those things of which you did talk in the way,
and let the matter be finished.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C7V9">&nbsp;</a>And he communicated the thing to Raguel: and Raguel said to Tobias, Eat and drink, and make merry:
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C7V10">&nbsp;</a>for it appertains to you to take my child. Howbeit I will show you the truth.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C7V11">&nbsp;</a>I have given my child to seven men, and whenever they came in to her, they died in the night. But for
the present be merry. And Tobias said, I will taste nothing here, until you⌃ make covenant and enter
into covenant with me.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C7V12">&nbsp;</a>And Raguel said, Take her to yourself from henceforth according to the manner: you are her brother, and
she is your: but the merciful God shall give all good success to you.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C7V13">&nbsp;</a>And he called his daughter Sarah, and took her by the hand, and gave her to be wife to Tobias, and said,
Behold, take her to yourself after the law of Moses, and lead her away to your father. And he blessed
them;
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C7V14">&nbsp;</a>And he called Edna his wife, and took a book, and wrote an instrument, and sealed it.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C7V15">&nbsp;</a>And they began to eat.

<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C7V16">&nbsp;</a>And Raguel called his wife Edna, and said to her, Sister, prepare the other chamber, and bring her in
there.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C7V17">&nbsp;</a>And she did as he bade her, and brought her in there: and she wept, and she received the tears of her
daughter, and said to her,
