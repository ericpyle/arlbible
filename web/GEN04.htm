 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C4V1">&nbsp;</a>The man knew<a href="#FN1"><span class="notemark">*</span><span class="popup">or, lay with, or, had relations with</span></a>
 Eve his wife. She conceived,<a href="#FN2"><span class="notemark">†</span><span class="popup">or, became pregnant</span></a>
 and gave birth to Cain, and said, “I have gotten a man with Yahweh’s help.”
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C4V2">&nbsp;</a>Again she gave birth, to Cain’s brother Abel. Abel was a keeper of sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the
ground.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C4V3">&nbsp;</a>As time passed, Cain brought an offering to Yahweh from the fruit of the ground.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C4V4">&nbsp;</a>Abel also brought some of the firstborn of his flock and of its fat. Yahweh respected Abel and his offering,
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C4V5">&nbsp;</a>but he didn’t respect Cain and his offering. Cain was very angry, and the expression on his face fell.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C4V6">&nbsp;</a>Yahweh said to Cain, “Why are you angry? Why has the expression of your face fallen?
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C4V7">&nbsp;</a>If you do well, won’t it be lifted up? If you don’t do well, sin crouches at the door. Its desire is
for you, but you are to rule over it.”
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C4V8">&nbsp;</a>Cain said to Abel, his brother, “Let’s go into the field.” While they were in the field, Cain rose up
against Abel, his brother, and killed him.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C4V9">&nbsp;</a>Yahweh said to Cain, “Where is Abel, your brother?”
</div>
<div class="p">He said, “I don’t know. Am I my brother’s keeper?”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C4V10">&nbsp;</a>Yahweh said, “What have you done? The voice of your brother’s blood cries to me from the ground.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C4V11">&nbsp;</a>Now you are cursed because of the ground, which has opened its mouth to receive your brother’s blood
from your hand.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C4V12">&nbsp;</a>From now on, when you till the ground, it won’t yield its strength to you. You will be a fugitive and
a wanderer in the earth.”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C4V13">&nbsp;</a>Cain said to Yahweh, “My punishment is greater than I can bear.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C4V14">&nbsp;</a>Behold, you have driven me out today from the surface of the ground. I will be hidden from your face,
and I will be a fugitive and a wanderer in the earth. Whoever finds me will kill me.”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C4V15">&nbsp;</a>Yahweh said to him, “Therefore whoever slays Cain, vengeance will be taken on him sevenfold.” Yahweh
appointed a sign for Cain, so that anyone finding him would not strike him.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C4V16">&nbsp;</a>Cain left Yahweh’s presence, and lived in the land of Nod, east of Eden.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C4V17">&nbsp;</a>Cain knew his wife. She conceived, and gave birth to Enoch. He built a city, and called the name of the
city, after the name of his son, Enoch.
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C4V18">&nbsp;</a>To Enoch was born Irad. Irad became the father of Mehujael. Mehujael became the father of Methushael.
Methushael became the father of Lamech.
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C4V19">&nbsp;</a>Lamech took two wives: the name of the first one was Adah, and the name of the second one was Zillah.
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C4V20">&nbsp;</a>Adah gave birth to Jabal, who was the father of those who dwell in tents and have livestock.
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C4V21">&nbsp;</a>His brother’s name was Jubal, who was the father of all who handle the harp and pipe.
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C4V22">&nbsp;</a>Zillah also gave birth to Tubal Cain, the forger of every cutting instrument of brass and iron. Tubal
Cain’s sister was Naamah.
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C4V23">&nbsp;</a>Lamech said to his wives,
</div>
<div class="q1">“Adah and Zillah, hear my voice.
</div>
<div class="q2">You wives of Lamech, listen to my speech,
</div>
<div class="q1">for I have slain a man for wounding me,
</div>
<div class="q2">a young man for bruising me.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C4V24">&nbsp;</a>If Cain will be avenged seven times,
</div>
<div class="q2">truly Lamech seventy-seven times.”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C4V25">&nbsp;</a>Adam knew his wife again. She gave birth to a son, and named him Seth, saying, “for God has given me
another child instead of Abel, for Cain killed him.”
 <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C4V26">&nbsp;</a>A son was also born to Seth, and he named him Enosh. At that time men began to call on Yahweh’s name.
