 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C16V1">&nbsp;</a>Now concerning the collection for the saints, as I commanded the assemblies of Galatia, you do likewise.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C16V2">&nbsp;</a>On the first day of the week, let each one of you save, as he may prosper, that no collections be made
when I come.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C16V3">&nbsp;</a>When I arrive, I will send whoever you approve with letters to carry your gracious gift to Jerusalem.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C16V4">&nbsp;</a>If it is appropriate for me to go also, they will go with me.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C16V5">&nbsp;</a>But I will come to you when I have passed through Macedonia, for I am passing through Macedonia.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C16V6">&nbsp;</a>But with you it may be that I will stay, or even winter, that you may send me on my journey wherever
I go.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C16V7">&nbsp;</a>For I do not wish to see you now in passing, but I hope to stay a while with you, if the Lord permits.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C16V8">&nbsp;</a>But I will stay at Ephesus until Pentecost,
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C16V9">&nbsp;</a>for a great and effective door has opened to me, and there are many adversaries.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C16V10">&nbsp;</a>Now if Timothy comes, see that he is with you without fear, for he does the work of the Lord, as I also
do.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C16V11">&nbsp;</a>Therefore let no one despise him. But set him forward on his journey in peace, that he may come to me;
for I expect him with the brothers.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C16V12">&nbsp;</a>Now concerning Apollos, the brother, I strongly urged him to come to you with the brothers; and it was
not at all his desire to come now; but he will come when he has an opportunity.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C16V13">&nbsp;</a>Watch! Stand firm in the faith! Be courageous! Be strong!
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C16V14">&nbsp;</a>Let all that you do be done in love.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C16V15">&nbsp;</a>Now I beg you, brothers (you know the house of Stephanas, that it is the first fruits of Achaia, and
that they have set themselves to serve the saints),
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C16V16">&nbsp;</a>that you also be in subjection to such, and to everyone who helps in the work and labors.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C16V17">&nbsp;</a>I rejoice at the coming of Stephanas, Fortunatus, and Achaicus; for that which was lacking on your part,
they supplied.
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C16V18">&nbsp;</a>For they refreshed my spirit and yours. Therefore acknowledge those who are like that.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C16V19">&nbsp;</a>The assemblies of Asia greet you. Aquila and Priscilla greet you much in the Lord, together with the
assembly that is in their house.
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C16V20">&nbsp;</a>All the brothers greet you. Greet one another with a holy kiss.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C16V21">&nbsp;</a>This greeting is by me, Paul, with my own hand.
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C16V22">&nbsp;</a>If any man doesn’t love the Lord Jesus Christ, let him be accursed.
