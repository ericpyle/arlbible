 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C35V1">&nbsp;</a>Yahweh spoke to Moses in the plains of Moab by the Jordan at Jericho, saying,
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C35V2">&nbsp;</a>“Command the children of Israel to give to the Levites of the inheritance of their possession cities
to dwell in. You shall give suburbs for the cities around them to the Levites.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C35V3">&nbsp;</a>They shall have the cities to dwell in. Their suburbs shall be for their livestock, and for their possessions,
and for all their animals.

 around it.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C35V5">&nbsp;</a>You shall measure outside of the city for the east side two thousand cubits, and for the south side two
thousand cubits, and for the west side two thousand cubits, and for the north side two thousand cubits,
the city being in the middle. This shall be the suburbs of their cities.

give for the man slayer to flee to. Besides them you shall give forty-two cities.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C35V7">&nbsp;</a>All the cities which you shall give to the Levites shall be forty-eight cities together with their suburbs.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C35V8">&nbsp;</a>Concerning the cities which you shall give of the possession of the children of Israel, from the many
you shall take many; and from the few you shall take few. Everyone according to his inheritance which
he inherits shall give some of his cities to the Levites.”
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C35V9">&nbsp;</a>Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C35V10">&nbsp;</a>“Speak to the children of Israel, and tell them, ‘When you pass over the Jordan into the land of Canaan,
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C35V11">&nbsp;</a>then you shall appoint for yourselves cities to be cities of refuge for you, that the man slayer who
kills any person unwittingly may flee there.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C35V12">&nbsp;</a>The cities shall be to you for refuge from the avenger, that the man slayer not die, until he stands
before the congregation for judgment.

 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C35V14">&nbsp;</a>You shall give three cities beyond the Jordan, and you shall give three cities in the land of Canaan.
They shall be cities of refuge.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C35V15">&nbsp;</a>For the children of Israel, and for the stranger and for the foreigner living among them, shall these
six cities be for refuge; that everyone who kills any person unwittingly may flee there.

murderer shall surely be put to death.

The murderer shall surely be put to death.

death.
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C35V20">&nbsp;</a>If he shoved him out of hatred, or hurled at him, lying in wait, so that he died,
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C35V21">&nbsp;</a>or in hostility struck him with his hand, so that he died, he who struck him shall surely be put to death.
He is a murderer. The avenger of blood shall put the murderer to death, when he meets him.

was not his enemy, neither sought his harm;

 <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C35V25">&nbsp;</a>The congregation shall deliver the man slayer out of the hand of the avenger of blood, and the congregation
shall restore him to his city of refuge, where he had fled. He shall dwell therein until the death of
the high priest, who was anointed with the holy oil.

kills the man slayer; he shall not be guilty of blood,
 <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C35V28">&nbsp;</a>because he should have remained in his city of refuge until the death of the high priest. But after the
death of the high priest, the man slayer shall return into the land of his possession.

 <span class="verse"> 34</span><a name="C35V34">&nbsp;</a>You shall not defile the land which you inhabit, in the middle of which I dwell; for I, Yahweh, dwell
in the middle of the children of Israel.’”
