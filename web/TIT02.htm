 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C2V1">&nbsp;</a>But say the things which fit sound doctrine,
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C2V2">&nbsp;</a>that older men should be temperate, sensible, sober minded, sound in faith, in love, and in perseverance:
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C2V3">&nbsp;</a>and that older women likewise be reverent in behavior, not slanderers nor enslaved to much wine, teachers
of that which is good;
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C2V4">&nbsp;</a>that they may train the young women to love their husbands, to love their children,
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C2V5">&nbsp;</a>to be sober minded, chaste, workers at home, kind, being in subjection to their own husbands, that God’s
word may not be blasphemed.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C2V6">&nbsp;</a>Likewise, exhort the younger men to be sober minded;
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C2V7">&nbsp;</a>in all things showing yourself an example of good works; in your teaching showing integrity, seriousness,
incorruptibility,
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C2V8">&nbsp;</a>and soundness of speech that can’t be condemned; that he who opposes you may be ashamed, having no evil
thing to say about us.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C2V9">&nbsp;</a>Exhort servants to be in subjection to their own masters, and to be well-pleasing in all things; not
contradicting;
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C2V10">&nbsp;</a>not stealing, but showing all good fidelity; that they may adorn the doctrine of God, our Savior, in
all things.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C2V11">&nbsp;</a>For the grace of God has appeared, bringing salvation to all men,
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C2V12">&nbsp;</a>instructing us to the intent that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we would live soberly, righteously,
and godly in this present world;
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C2V13">&nbsp;</a>looking for the blessed hope and appearing of the glory of our great God and Savior, Jesus Christ;
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C2V14">&nbsp;</a>who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify for himself a people for
his own possession, zealous for good works.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C2V15">&nbsp;</a>Say these things and exhort and reprove with all authority. Let no man despise you.
