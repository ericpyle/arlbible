 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C9V1">&nbsp;</a>I tell the truth in Christ. I am not lying, my conscience testifying with me in the Holy Spirit,
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C9V2">&nbsp;</a>that I have great sorrow and unceasing pain in my heart.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C9V3">&nbsp;</a>For I could wish that I myself were accursed from Christ for my brothers’ sake, my relatives according
to the flesh,
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C9V4">&nbsp;</a>who are Israelites; whose is the adoption, the glory, the covenants, the giving of the law, the service,
and the promises;
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C9V5">&nbsp;</a>of whom are the fathers, and from whom is Christ as concerning the flesh, who is over all, God, blessed
forever. Amen.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C9V6">&nbsp;</a>But it is not as though the word of God has come to nothing. For they are not all Israel, that are of
Israel.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C9V7">&nbsp;</a>Neither, because they are Abraham’s offspring,<a href="#FN1"><span class="notemark">*</span><span class="popup">or, seed</span></a>
 are they all children. But, “your offspring<a href="#FN2"><span class="notemark">†</span><span class="popup">or, seed</span></a>
 will be accounted as from Isaac.”<a href="#FN3"><span class="notemark"></span><span class="popup">+ Genesis 21:12</span></a>
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C9V8">&nbsp;</a>That is, it is not the children of the flesh who are children of God, but the children of the promise
are counted as heirs.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C9V9">&nbsp;</a>For this is a word of promise, “At the appointed time I will come, and Sarah will have a son.”<a href="#FN4"><span class="notemark"></span><span class="popup">+ Genesis 18:10,14</span></a>
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C9V10">&nbsp;</a>Not only so, but Rebekah also conceived by one, by our father Isaac.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C9V11">&nbsp;</a>For being not yet born, neither having done anything good or bad, that the purpose of God according to
election might stand, not of works, but of him who calls,<a href="#FN5"><span class="notemark">‡</span><span class="popup">NA puts the phrase “not of works, but of him who calls” at the beginning of verse 12 instead of the end
of verse 11.</span></a>
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C9V12">&nbsp;</a>it was said to her, “The elder will serve the younger.”<a href="#FN6"><span class="notemark"></span><span class="popup">+ Genesis 25:23</span></a>
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C9V13">&nbsp;</a>Even as it is written, “Jacob I loved, but Esau I hated.”<a href="#FN7"><span class="notemark"></span><span class="popup">+ Malachi 1:2-3</span></a>
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C9V14">&nbsp;</a>What shall we say then? Is there unrighteousness with God? May it never be!
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C9V15">&nbsp;</a>For he said to Moses, “I will have mercy on whom I have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I have
compassion.”<a href="#FN8"><span class="notemark"></span><span class="popup">+ Exodus 33:19</span></a>
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C9V16">&nbsp;</a>So then it is not of him who wills, nor of him who runs, but of God who has mercy.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C9V17">&nbsp;</a>For the Scripture says to Pharaoh, “For this very purpose I caused you to be raised up, that I might
show in you my power, and that my name might be proclaimed in all the earth.”<a href="#FN9"><span class="notemark"></span><span class="popup">+ Exodus 9:16</span></a>
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C9V18">&nbsp;</a>So then, he has mercy on whom he desires, and he hardens whom he desires.
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C9V19">&nbsp;</a>You will say then to me, “Why does he still find fault? For who withstands his will?”
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C9V20">&nbsp;</a>But indeed, O man, who are you to reply against God? Will the thing formed ask him who formed it, “Why
did you make me like this?”<a href="#FN10"><span class="notemark"></span><span class="popup">+ Isaiah 29:16; 45:9</span></a>
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C9V21">&nbsp;</a>Or hasn’t the potter a right over the clay, from the same lump to make one part a vessel for honor, and
another for dishonor?
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C9V22">&nbsp;</a>What if God, willing to show his wrath, and to make his power known, endured with much patience vessels
of wrath made for destruction,
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C9V23">&nbsp;</a>and that he might make known the riches of his glory on vessels of mercy, which he prepared beforehand
for glory,
 <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C9V24">&nbsp;</a>us, whom he also called, not from the Jews only, but also from the Gentiles?
 <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C9V25">&nbsp;</a>As he says also in Hosea,
</div>
<div class="q1">“I will call them ‘my people,’ which were not my people;
</div>
<div class="q2">and her ‘beloved,’ who was not beloved.”<a href="#FN11"><span class="notemark"></span><span class="popup">+ Hosea 2:23</span></a>
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C9V26">&nbsp;</a>“It will be that in the place where it was said to them, ‘You are not my people,’
</div>
<div class="q2">There they will be called ‘children of the living God.’”<a href="#FN12"><span class="notemark"></span><span class="popup">+ Hosea 1:10
</span></a>
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C9V27">&nbsp;</a>Isaiah cries concerning Israel,
</div>
<div class="q1">“If the number of the children of Israel are as the sand of the sea,
</div>
<div class="q2">it is the remnant who will be saved;
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C9V28">&nbsp;</a>for He will finish the work and cut it short in righteousness,
</div>
<div class="q2">because the LORD will make a short work upon the earth.”<a href="#FN13"><span class="notemark"></span><span class="popup">+ Isaiah 10:22-23</span></a>
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C9V29">&nbsp;</a>As Isaiah has said before,
</div>
<div class="q1">“Unless the Lord of Armies<a href="#FN14"><span class="notemark">§</span><span class="popup">Greek: Sabaoth (for Hebrew: Tze’va’ot)
</span></a>
 had left us a seed,
</div>
<div class="q2">we would have become like Sodom,
</div>
<div class="q2">and would have been made like Gomorrah.”<a href="#FN15"><span class="notemark"></span><span class="popup">+ Isaiah 1:9</span></a>
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 30</span><a name="C9V30">&nbsp;</a>What shall we say then? That the Gentiles, who didn’t follow after righteousness, attained to righteousness,
even the righteousness which is of faith;
 <span class="verse"> 31</span><a name="C9V31">&nbsp;</a>but Israel, following after a law of righteousness, didn’t arrive at the law of righteousness.
 <span class="verse"> 32</span><a name="C9V32">&nbsp;</a>Why? Because they didn’t seek it by faith, but as it were by works of the law. They stumbled over the
stumbling stone;
 <span class="verse"> 33</span><a name="C9V33">&nbsp;</a>even as it is written,
</div>
<div class="q1">“Behold,<a href="#FN16"><span class="notemark">**</span><span class="popup">“Behold”, from “ἰδοὺ”, means look at, take notice, observe, see, or gaze at. It is often used as an interjection.</span></a>
 I lay in Zion a stumbling stone and a rock of offense;
</div>
<div class="q2">and no one who believes in him will be disappointed.”<a href="#FN17"><span class="notemark"></span><span class="popup">+ Isaiah 8:14; 28:16</span></a>
