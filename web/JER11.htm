<div class="chapterlabel"> 11</div><div class="p">
 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C11V1">&nbsp;</a>The word that came to Jeremiah from Yahweh, saying,
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C11V2">&nbsp;</a>“Hear the words of this covenant, and speak to the men of Judah, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem;
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C11V3">&nbsp;</a>and say to them, Yahweh, the God of Israel says: ‘Cursed is the man who doesn’t hear the words of this
covenant,
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C11V4">&nbsp;</a>which I commanded your fathers in the day that I brought them out of the land of Egypt, out of the iron
furnace,’ saying, ‘Obey my voice, and do them, according to all which I command you; so you shall be
my people, and I will be your God;
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C11V5">&nbsp;</a>that I may establish the oath which I swore to your fathers, to give them a land flowing with milk and
honey,’ as it is today.”
</div>
<div class="p">Then answered I, and said, “Amen, Yahweh.”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C11V6">&nbsp;</a>Yahweh said to me, “Proclaim all these words in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem,
saying, ‘Hear the words of this covenant, and do them.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C11V7">&nbsp;</a>For I earnestly protested to your fathers in the day that I brought them up out of the land of Egypt,
even to this day, rising early and protesting, saying, “Obey my voice.”
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C11V8">&nbsp;</a>Yet they didn’t obey, nor turn their ear, but everyone walked in the stubbornness of their evil heart.
Therefore I brought on them all the words of this covenant, which I commanded them to do, but they didn’t
do them.’”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C11V9">&nbsp;</a>Yahweh said to me, “A conspiracy is found among the men of Judah, and among the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C11V10">&nbsp;</a>They have turned back to the iniquities of their forefathers, who refused to hear my words. They have
gone after other gods to serve them. The house of Israel and the house of Judah have broken my covenant
which I made with their fathers.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C11V11">&nbsp;</a>Therefore Yahweh says, ‘Behold, I will bring evil on them, which they will not be able to escape; and
they will cry to me, but I will not listen to them.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C11V12">&nbsp;</a>Then the cities of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem will go and cry to the gods to which they offer
incense, but they will not save them at all in the time of their trouble.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C11V13">&nbsp;</a>For according to the number of your cities are your gods, Judah; and according to the number of the streets
of Jerusalem have you set up altars to the shameful thing, even altars to burn incense to Baal.’
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C11V14">&nbsp;</a>“Therefore don’t pray for this people. Don’t lift up cry or prayer for them; for I will not hear them
in the time that they cry to me because of their trouble.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C11V15">&nbsp;</a>What has my beloved to do in my house,
</div>
<div class="q2">since she has behaved lewdly with many,
</div>
<div class="q2">and the holy flesh has passed from you?
</div>
<div class="q1">When you do evil,
</div>
<div class="q2">then you rejoice.”
</div>
<div class="b"></div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C11V16">&nbsp;</a>Yahweh called your name, “A green olive tree,
</div>
<div class="q2">beautiful with goodly fruit.”
</div>
<div class="q1">With the noise of a great roar he has kindled fire on it,
</div>
<div class="q2">and its branches are broken.
</div>
<div class="m"> <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C11V17">&nbsp;</a>For Yahweh of Armies, who planted you, has pronounced evil against you, because of the evil of the house
of Israel and of the house of Judah, which they have done to themselves in provoking me to anger by offering
incense to Baal.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C11V18">&nbsp;</a>Yahweh gave me knowledge of it, and I knew it. Then you showed me their doings.
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C11V19">&nbsp;</a>But I was like a gentle lamb that is led to the slaughter. I didn’t know that they had devised plans
against me, saying,
</div>
<div class="q1">“Let us destroy the tree with its fruit,
</div>
<div class="q2">and let us cut him off from the land of the living,
</div>
<div class="q2">that his name may be no more remembered.”
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C11V20">&nbsp;</a>But, Yahweh of Armies, who judges righteously,
</div>
<div class="q2">who tests the heart and the mind,
</div>
<div class="q1">I will see your vengeance on them;
</div>
<div class="q2">for to you I have revealed my cause.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C11V21">&nbsp;</a>“Therefore Yahweh says concerning the men of Anathoth, who seek your life, saying, ‘You shall not prophesy
in Yahweh’s name, that you not die by our hand;’
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C11V22">&nbsp;</a>therefore Yahweh of Armies says, ‘Behold, I will punish them. The young men will die by the sword. Their
sons and their daughters will die by famine.
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C11V23">&nbsp;</a>There will be no remnant to them, for I will bring evil on the men of Anathoth, even the year of their
visitation.’”
