 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C7V1">&nbsp;</a>After these things, Jesus was walking in Galilee, for he wouldn’t walk in Judea, because the Jews sought
to kill him.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C7V2">&nbsp;</a>Now the feast of the Jews, the Feast of Booths, was at hand.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C7V3">&nbsp;</a>His brothers therefore said to him, “Depart from here, and go into Judea, that your disciples also may
see your works which you do.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C7V4">&nbsp;</a>For no one does anything in secret, and himself seeks to be known openly. If you do these things, reveal
yourself to the world.”
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C7V5">&nbsp;</a>For even his brothers didn’t believe in him.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C7V6">&nbsp;</a>Jesus therefore said to them,
<span class="wj">“My time has not yet come, but your time is always ready.
</span> <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C7V7">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">The world can’t hate you, but it hates me, because I testify about it, that its works are evil.
</span> <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C7V8">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">You go up to the feast. I am not yet going up to this feast, because my time is not yet fulfilled.”</span></div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C7V9">&nbsp;</a>Having said these things to them, he stayed in Galilee.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C7V10">&nbsp;</a>But when his brothers had gone up to the feast, then he also went up, not publicly, but as it were in
secret.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C7V11">&nbsp;</a>The Jews therefore sought him at the feast, and said, “Where is he?”
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C7V12">&nbsp;</a>There was much murmuring among the multitudes concerning him. Some said, “He is a good man.” Others said,
“Not so, but he leads the multitude astray.”
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C7V13">&nbsp;</a>Yet no one spoke openly of him for fear of the Jews.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C7V14">&nbsp;</a>But when it was now the middle of the feast, Jesus went up into the temple and taught.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C7V15">&nbsp;</a>The Jews therefore marveled, saying, “How does this man know letters, having never been educated?”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C7V16">&nbsp;</a>Jesus therefore answered them,
<span class="wj">“My teaching is not mine, but his who sent me.
</span> <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C7V17">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">If anyone desires to do his will, he will know about the teaching, whether it is from God, or if I am
speaking from myself.
</span> <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C7V18">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">He who speaks from himself seeks his own glory, but he who seeks the glory of him who sent him is true,
and no unrighteousness is in him.
</span> <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C7V19">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Didn’t Moses give you the law, and yet none of you keeps the law? Why do you seek to kill me?”</span></div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C7V20">&nbsp;</a>The multitude answered, “You have a demon! Who seeks to kill you?”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C7V21">&nbsp;</a>Jesus answered them,
<span class="wj">“I did one work, and you all marvel because of it.
</span> <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C7V22">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Moses has given you circumcision (not that it is of Moses, but of the fathers), and on the Sabbath you
circumcise a boy.
</span> <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C7V23">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">If a boy receives circumcision on the Sabbath, that the law of Moses may not be broken, are you angry
with me, because I made a man completely healthy on the Sabbath?
</span> <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C7V24">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Don’t judge according to appearance, but judge righteous judgment.”
</span></div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C7V25">&nbsp;</a>Therefore some of them of Jerusalem said, “Isn’t this he whom they seek to kill?
 <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C7V26">&nbsp;</a>Behold, he speaks openly, and they say nothing to him. Can it be that the rulers indeed know that this
is truly the Christ?
 <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C7V27">&nbsp;</a>However we know where this man comes from, but when the Christ comes, no one will know where he comes
from.”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C7V28">&nbsp;</a>Jesus therefore cried out in the temple, teaching and saying,
<span class="wj">“You both know me, and know where I am from. I have not come of myself, but he who sent me is true, whom
you don’t know.
</span> <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C7V29">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">I know him, because I am from him, and he sent me.”</span></div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 30</span><a name="C7V30">&nbsp;</a>They sought therefore to take him; but no one laid a hand on him, because his hour had not yet come.
 <span class="verse"> 31</span><a name="C7V31">&nbsp;</a>But of the multitude, many believed in him. They said, “When the Christ comes, he won’t do more signs
than those which this man has done, will he?”
 <span class="verse"> 32</span><a name="C7V32">&nbsp;</a>The Pharisees heard the multitude murmuring these things concerning him, and the chief priests and the
Pharisees sent officers to arrest him.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 33</span><a name="C7V33">&nbsp;</a>Then Jesus said,
<span class="wj">“I will be with you a little while longer, then I go to him who sent me.
</span> <span class="verse"> 34</span><a name="C7V34">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">You will seek me, and won’t find me; and where I am, you can’t come.”</span></div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 35</span><a name="C7V35">&nbsp;</a>The Jews therefore said among themselves, “Where will this man go that we won’t find him? Will he go
to the Dispersion among the Greeks, and teach the Greeks?
 <span class="verse"> 36</span><a name="C7V36">&nbsp;</a>What is this word that he said,
<span class="wj">‘You will seek me, and won’t find me; and where I am, you can’t come’</span>?”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 37</span><a name="C7V37">&nbsp;</a>Now on the last and greatest day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried out,
<span class="wj">“If anyone is thirsty, let him come to me and drink!
</span> <span class="verse"> 38</span><a name="C7V38">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">He who believes in me, as the Scripture has said, from within him will flow rivers of living water.”</span> <span class="verse"> 39</span><a name="C7V39">&nbsp;</a>But he said this about the Spirit, which those believing in him were to receive. For the Holy Spirit
was not yet given, because Jesus wasn’t yet glorified.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 40</span><a name="C7V40">&nbsp;</a>Many of the multitude therefore, when they heard these words, said, “This is truly the prophet.”
 <span class="verse"> 41</span><a name="C7V41">&nbsp;</a>Others said, “This is the Christ.” But some said, “What, does the Christ come out of Galilee?
 <span class="verse"> 42</span><a name="C7V42">&nbsp;</a>Hasn’t the Scripture said that the Christ comes of the offspring<a href="#FN1"><span class="notemark">*</span><span class="popup">or, seed</span></a>
 of David,
<a href="#FN2"><span class="notemark"></span><span class="popup">+ 2 Samuel 7:12</span></a>
 and from Bethlehem,<a href="#FN3"><span class="notemark"></span><span class="popup">+ Micah 5:2</span></a>
 the village where David was?”
 <span class="verse"> 43</span><a name="C7V43">&nbsp;</a>So there arose a division in the multitude because of him.
 <span class="verse"> 44</span><a name="C7V44">&nbsp;</a>Some of them would have arrested him, but no one laid hands on him.
 <span class="verse"> 45</span><a name="C7V45">&nbsp;</a>The officers therefore came to the chief priests and Pharisees, and they said to them, “Why didn’t you
bring him?”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 46</span><a name="C7V46">&nbsp;</a>The officers answered, “No man ever spoke like this man!”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 47</span><a name="C7V47">&nbsp;</a>The Pharisees therefore answered them, “You aren’t also led astray, are you?
 <span class="verse"> 48</span><a name="C7V48">&nbsp;</a>Have any of the rulers believed in him, or of the Pharisees?
 <span class="verse"> 49</span><a name="C7V49">&nbsp;</a>But this multitude that doesn’t know the law is accursed.”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 50</span><a name="C7V50">&nbsp;</a>Nicodemus (he who came to him by night, being one of them) said to them,
 <span class="verse"> 51</span><a name="C7V51">&nbsp;</a>“Does our law judge a man, unless it first hears from him personally and knows what he does?”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 52</span><a name="C7V52">&nbsp;</a>They answered him, “Are you also from Galilee? Search, and see that no prophet has arisen out of Galilee.”<a href="#FN4"><span class="notemark"></span><span class="popup">+ See Isaiah 9:1 and Matthew 4:13-16.
