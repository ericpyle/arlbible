 Enemessar king of the Assyrians was carried away captive out of Thisbe, which is on the right hand of
Kedesh Naphtali in Galilee above Asher.

<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C1V3">&nbsp;</a>I Tobit walked in the ways of truth and righteousness all the days of my life, and I did many alms deeds
to my brethren and my nation, who went with me into the land of the Assyrians, to Nineveh.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C1V4">&nbsp;</a>And when I was in mine own country, in the land of Israel, while I was yet young, all the tribe of Naphtali
my father fell away from the house of Jerusalem, which was chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, that
all the tribes should sacrifice
<span class="add">there,
</span> and the temple of the habitation of the Most High was hallowed and built
<span class="add">therein
</span> for all ages.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C1V5">&nbsp;</a>And all the tribes which fell away together sacrificed to the heifer Baal, and so did the house of Naphtali
my father.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C1V6">&nbsp;</a>And I alone went often to Jerusalem at the feasts, as it has been ordained to all Israel by an everlasting
decree, having the first fruits and the tenths of mine increase, and that which was first shorn; and
I gave them at the altar to the priests the sons of Aaron.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C1V7">&nbsp;</a>The tenth part of all mine increase I gave to the sons of Levi, who ministered at Jerusalem: and the
second tenth part I sold away, and went, and spent it each year at Jerusalem:
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C1V8">&nbsp;</a>and the third I gave to them to whom it was meet, as Deborah my father’s mother had commanded me, because
I was left an orphan by my father.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C1V9">&nbsp;</a>And when I became a man, I took as wife Anna of the seed of our own family, and of her I became the father
of Tobias.

eat of the bread of the Gentiles:

 favor in the sight of Enemessar, and I was his purveyor.

talents of silver.

 in his time the highways were troubled, and I could no more go into Media.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C1V16">&nbsp;</a>And in the days of Enemessar I did many alms deeds to my brethren: I gave my bread to the hungry,

 on the wall of Ninevah, I buried him.
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C1V18">&nbsp;</a>And if Sennacherib the king killed any, when he came fleeing from Judaea, I buried them privily; for
in his wrath he killed many; and the bodies were sought for by the king, and were not found.
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C1V19">&nbsp;</a>But one of the Ninevites went and showed to the king concerning me, how that I buried them, and hid myself;
and when I knew that I was sought for to be put to death, I withdrew myself for fear.
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C1V20">&nbsp;</a>And all my goods were forcibly taken away, and there was nothing left to me, save my wife Anna and my
son Tobias.
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C1V21">&nbsp;</a>And there passed not five and fifty days, before two of his sons killed him, and they fled into the mountains
of Ararat. And

 Sarchedonus his son reigned in his stead; and he appointed over all the accounts of his kingdom, and
over all his affairs, Achiacharus my brother Anael’s son.
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C1V22">&nbsp;</a>And Achiacharus made request for me, and I came to Nineveh. Now Achiacharus was cupbearer, and keeper
of the signet, and steward, and overseer of the accounts: and Sarchedonus appointed him next to himself:
but he was my brother’s son.
