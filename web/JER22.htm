<div class="chapterlabel"> 22</div><div class="p">
 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C22V1">&nbsp;</a>Yahweh said, “Go down to the house of the king of Judah, and speak this word, there:
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C22V2">&nbsp;</a>‘Hear Yahweh’s word, king of Judah, who sits on David’s throne, you, your servants, and your people who
enter in by these gates.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C22V3">&nbsp;</a>Yahweh says: “Execute justice and righteousness, and deliver him who is robbed out of the hand of the
oppressor. Do no wrong. Do no violence to the foreigner, the fatherless, or the widow. Don’t shed innocent
blood in this place.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C22V4">&nbsp;</a>For if you do this thing indeed, then kings sitting on David’s throne will enter in by the gates of this
house, riding in chariots and on horses, he, his servants, and his people.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C22V5">&nbsp;</a>But if you will not hear these words, I swear by myself,” says Yahweh, “that this house will become a
desolation.”’”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C22V6">&nbsp;</a>For Yahweh says concerning the house of the king of Judah:
</div>
<div class="q1">“You are Gilead to me,
</div>
<div class="q2">the head of Lebanon.
</div>
<div class="q1">Yet surely I will make you a wilderness,
</div>
<div class="q2">cities which are not inhabited.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C22V7">&nbsp;</a>I will prepare destroyers against you,
</div>
<div class="q2">everyone with his weapons,
</div>
<div class="q1">and they will cut down your choice cedars,
</div>
<div class="q2">and cast them into the fire.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C22V8">&nbsp;</a>“Many nations will pass by this city, and they will each ask his neighbor, ‘Why has Yahweh done this
to this great city?’
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C22V9">&nbsp;</a>Then they will answer, ‘Because they abandoned the covenant of Yahweh their God, worshiped other gods,
and served them.’”
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C22V10">&nbsp;</a>Don’t weep for the dead.
</div>
<div class="q2">Don’t bemoan him;
</div>
<div class="q1">but weep bitterly for him who goes away,
</div>
<div class="q2">for he will return no more,
</div>
<div class="q2">and not see his native country.
</div>
<div class="m"> <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C22V11">&nbsp;</a>For Yahweh says touching Shallum the son of Josiah, king of Judah, who reigned instead of Josiah his
father, and who went out of this place: “He won’t return there any more.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C22V12">&nbsp;</a>But in the place where they have led him captive, there will he die, and he will see this land no more.”
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C22V13">&nbsp;</a>“Woe to him who builds his house by unrighteousness,
</div>
<div class="q2">and his rooms by injustice;
</div>
<div class="q1">who uses his neighbor’s service without wages,
</div>
<div class="q2">and doesn’t give him his hire;
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C22V14">&nbsp;</a>who says, ‘I will build myself a wide house and spacious rooms,’
</div>
<div class="q2">and cuts out windows for himself;
</div>
<div class="q1">with a cedar ceiling,
</div>
<div class="q2">and painted with vermilion.
</div>
<div class="b"></div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C22V15">&nbsp;</a>“Should you reign, because you strive to excel in cedar?
</div>
<div class="q2">Didn’t your father eat and drink,
</div>
<div class="q2">and do justice and righteousness?
</div>
<div class="q2">Then it was well with him.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C22V16">&nbsp;</a>He judged the cause of the poor and needy;
</div>
<div class="q2">so it was well, then.
</div>
<div class="q1">Wasn’t this to know me?”
</div>
<div class="q2">says Yahweh.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C22V17">&nbsp;</a>But your eyes and your heart are only for your covetousness,
</div>
<div class="q2">for shedding innocent blood,
</div>
<div class="q2">for oppression, and for doing violence.”
</div>
<div class="m"> <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C22V18">&nbsp;</a>Therefore Yahweh says concerning Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah:
</div>
<div class="q1">“They won’t lament for him,
</div>
<div class="q2">saying, ‘Ah my brother!’ or, ‘Ah sister!’
</div>
<div class="q1">They won’t lament for him,
</div>
<div class="q2">saying ‘Ah lord!’ or, ‘Ah his glory!’
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C22V19">&nbsp;</a>He will be buried with the burial of a donkey,
</div>
<div class="q2">drawn and cast out beyond the gates of Jerusalem.”
</div>
<div class="b"></div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C22V20">&nbsp;</a>“Go up to Lebanon, and cry.
</div>
<div class="q2">Lift up your voice in Bashan,
</div>
<div class="q1">and cry from Abarim;
</div>
<div class="q2">for all your lovers have been destroyed.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C22V21">&nbsp;</a>I spoke to you in your prosperity;
</div>
<div class="q2">but you said, ‘I will not listen.’
</div>
<div class="q1">This has been your way from your youth,
</div>
<div class="q2">that you didn’t obey my voice.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C22V22">&nbsp;</a>The wind will feed all your shepherds,
</div>
<div class="q2">and your lovers will go into captivity.
</div>
<div class="q1">Surely then you will be ashamed
</div>
<div class="q2">and confounded for all your wickedness.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C22V23">&nbsp;</a>Inhabitant of Lebanon,
</div>
<div class="q2">who makes your nest in the cedars,
</div>
<div class="q1">how greatly to be pitied you will be when pangs come on you,
</div>
<div class="q2">the pain as of a woman in travail!
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C22V24">&nbsp;</a>“As I live,” says Yahweh, “though Coniah the son of Jehoiakim king of Judah were the signet on my right
hand, yet would I pluck you from there.
 <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C22V25">&nbsp;</a>I would give you into the hand of those who seek your life, and into the hand of them of whom you are
afraid, even into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and into the hand of the Chaldeans.
 <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C22V26">&nbsp;</a>I will cast you out with your mother who bore you into another country, where you were not born; and
there you will die.
 <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C22V27">&nbsp;</a>But to the land to which their soul longs to return, there they will not return.”
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C22V28">&nbsp;</a>Is this man Coniah a despised broken vessel?
</div>
<div class="q2">Is he a vessel in which no one delights?
</div>
<div class="q1">Why are they cast out, he and his offspring,<a href="#FN1"><span class="notemark">*</span><span class="popup">or, seed</span></a>
</div>
<div class="q2">and cast into a land which they don’t know?
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C22V29">&nbsp;</a>O earth, earth, earth,
</div>
<div class="q2">hear Yahweh’s word!
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 30</span><a name="C22V30">&nbsp;</a>Yahweh says,
</div>
<div class="q2">“Record this man as childless,
</div>
<div class="q2">a man who will not prosper in his days;
</div>
<div class="q1">for no more will a man of his offspring<a href="#FN2"><span class="notemark">†</span><span class="popup">or, seed</span></a>
 prosper,
</div>
<div class="q2">sitting on David’s throne,
</div>
<div class="q2">and ruling in Judah.”
