 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C8V1">&nbsp;</a>When Samuel was old, he made his sons judges over Israel.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C8V2">&nbsp;</a>Now the name of his firstborn was Joel; and the name of his second, Abijah. They were judges in Beersheba.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C8V3">&nbsp;</a>His sons didn’t walk in his ways, but turned aside after dishonest gain, took bribes, and perverted justice.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C8V4">&nbsp;</a>Then all the elders of Israel gathered themselves together and came to Samuel to Ramah.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C8V5">&nbsp;</a>They said to him, “Behold, you are old, and your sons don’t walk in your ways. Now make us a king to
judge us like all the nations.”
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C8V6">&nbsp;</a>But the thing displeased Samuel, when they said, “Give us a king to judge us.”
</div>
<div class="p">Samuel prayed to Yahweh.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C8V7">&nbsp;</a>Yahweh said to Samuel, “Listen to the voice of the people in all that they tell you; for they have not
rejected you, but they have rejected me as the king over them.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C8V8">&nbsp;</a>According to all the works which they have done since the day that I brought them up out of Egypt even
to this day, in that they have forsaken me, and served other gods, so they also do to you.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C8V9">&nbsp;</a>Now therefore listen to their voice. However you shall protest solemnly to them, and shall show them
the way of the king who will reign over them.”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C8V10">&nbsp;</a>Samuel told all Yahweh’s words to the people who asked him for a king.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C8V11">&nbsp;</a>He said, “This will be the way of the king who shall reign over you: he will take your sons, and appoint
them as his servants, for his chariots, and to be his horsemen; and they will run before his chariots.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C8V12">&nbsp;</a>He will appoint them to him for captains of thousands, and captains of fifties; and he will assign some
to plow his ground, and to reap his harvest, and to make his instruments of war, and the instruments
of his chariots.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C8V13">&nbsp;</a>He will take your daughters to be perfumers, to be cooks, and to be bakers.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C8V14">&nbsp;</a>He will take your fields, your vineyards, and your olive groves, even their best, and give them to his
servants.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C8V15">&nbsp;</a>He will take one tenth of your seed, and of your vineyards, and give it to his officers, and to his servants.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C8V16">&nbsp;</a>He will take your male servants, your female servants, your best young men, and your donkeys, and assign
them to his own work.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C8V17">&nbsp;</a>He will take one tenth of your flocks; and you will be his servants.
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C8V18">&nbsp;</a>You will cry out in that day because of your king whom you will have chosen for yourselves; and Yahweh
will not answer you in that day.”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C8V19">&nbsp;</a>But the people refused to listen to the voice of Samuel; and they said, “No; but we will have a king
over us,
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C8V20">&nbsp;</a>that we also may be like all the nations, and that our king may judge us, and go out before us, and fight
our battles.”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C8V21">&nbsp;</a>Samuel heard all the words of the people, and he rehearsed them in the ears of Yahweh.
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C8V22">&nbsp;</a>Yahweh said to Samuel, “Listen to their voice, and make them a king.”
</div>
<div class="p">Samuel said to the men of Israel, “Everyone go to your own city.”
