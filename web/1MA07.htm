</span></a>
 the hundred and one and fifties year Demetrius the son of Seleucus came forth from Rome, and went up
with a few men to a city by the sea, and reigned there.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C7V2">&nbsp;</a>And it came to pass, when he would go into the house of the kingdom of his fathers, that the army laid
hands on Antiochus and Lysias, to bring them to him.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C7V3">&nbsp;</a>And the thing was known to him, and he said, show me not their faces.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C7V4">&nbsp;</a>And the army killed them. And Demetrius sat upon the throne of his kingdom.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C7V5">&nbsp;</a>And there came to him all the lawless and ungodly men of Israel; and Alcimus was their leader, desiring
to be high priest;
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C7V6">&nbsp;</a>and they accused the people to the king, saying, Judas and his brethren have destroyed all your friends,
and have scattered us from our own land.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C7V7">&nbsp;</a>Now therefore send a man whom you trust, and let him go and see all the havock which he has made of us,
and of the king’s country, and
<span class="add">how
</span> he has punished them and all that helped them.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C7V8">&nbsp;</a>And the king chose Bacchides, one of the king’s

 Friends, who was ruler in the country beyond the river, and was a great man in the kingdom, and faithful
to the king.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C7V9">&nbsp;</a>And he sent him, and that ungodly Alcimus, and made sure to him the high priesthood, and he commanded
him to take vengeance upon the children of Israel.

<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C7V10">&nbsp;</a>And they removed, and came with a great host into the land of Judah, and he sent messengers to Judas
and his brethren with words of peace deceitfully.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C7V11">&nbsp;</a>And they gave no heed to their words; for they saw that they were come with a great host.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C7V12">&nbsp;</a>And there were gathered together to Alcimus and Bacchides a company of scribes, to seek for justice.

 Hasidaeans were the first among the children of Israel that sought peace of them;

wrong.

nor your friends.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C7V16">&nbsp;</a>And they gave him credence: and he laid hands on threescore men of them, and killed them in one day,

<div class="q1">And there was no man to bury them.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C7V18">&nbsp;</a>And the fear and the dread of them fell upon all the people, for they said, There is neither truth nor
judgement in them; for they have broken the covenant and the oath which they sware.
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C7V19">&nbsp;</a>And Bacchides removed from Jerusalem, and encamped in Bezeth; and he sent and took away many of the deserters
that were with him, and certain of the people, and he killed them,
<span class="add">and cast them
</span> into the great pit.
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C7V20">&nbsp;</a>And he made sure the country to Alcimus, and left with him a force to aid him; and Bacchides went away
to the king.

<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C7V21">&nbsp;</a>And Alcimus strove for his high priesthood.
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C7V22">&nbsp;</a>And there were gathered to him all they that troubled their people, and they got the mastery of the land
of Judah, and did great hurt in Israel.
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C7V23">&nbsp;</a>And Judas saw all the mischief that Alcimus and his company had done among the children of Israel,
<span class="add">even
</span> above the Gentiles,
 <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C7V24">&nbsp;</a>and he went out into all the coasts of Judaea round about, and took vengeance on the men that had deserted
from him, and they were restrained from going forth into the country.
 <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C7V25">&nbsp;</a>But when Alcimus saw that Judas and his company waxed strong, and knew that he was not able to withstand
them, he returned to the king, and brought evil accusations against them.

 And the king sent Nicanor, one of his honorable princes, a man that hated Israel and was their enemy,
and commanded him to destroy the people.
 <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C7V27">&nbsp;</a>And Nicanor came to Jerusalem with a great host; and he sent to Judas and his brethren deceitfully with
words of peace, saying,
 <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C7V28">&nbsp;</a>Let there be no battle between me and you; I will come with a few men, that I may see your faces in peace.
 <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C7V29">&nbsp;</a>And he came to Judas, and they saluted one another peaceably. And the enemies were ready to take away
Judas by violence.
 <span class="verse"> 30</span><a name="C7V30">&nbsp;</a>And the thing was known to Judas,
<span class="add">to wit,
</span> that he came to him with deceit, and he was sore afraid of him, and would see his face no more.
 <span class="verse"> 31</span><a name="C7V31">&nbsp;</a>And Nicanor knew that his counsel was discovered; and he went out to meet Judas in battle beside Capharsalama;
 <span class="verse"> 32</span><a name="C7V32">&nbsp;</a>and there fell of Nicanor’s side about

 five hundred men, and they fled into the city of David.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 33</span><a name="C7V33">&nbsp;</a>And after these things Nicanor went up to mount Sion: and there came some of the priests out of the sanctuary,
and some of the elders of the people, to salute him peaceably, and to show him the whole burned sacrifice
that was being offered for the king.
 <span class="verse"> 34</span><a name="C7V34">&nbsp;</a>And he mocked them, and laughed at them, and
<a href="#FN7"><span class="notemark">‡‡</span><span class="popup">Gr.
polluted them.
</span></a>
 entreated them shamefully, and spoke haughtily,
 <span class="verse"> 35</span><a name="C7V35">&nbsp;</a>and sware in a rage, saying, Unless Judas and his army be now delivered into my hands, it shall be that,
if I come again in peace, I will burn up this house: and he went out in a great rage.
 <span class="verse"> 36</span><a name="C7V36">&nbsp;</a>And the priests entered in, and stood before the altar and the temple; and they wept, and said,
 <span class="verse"> 37</span><a name="C7V37">&nbsp;</a>You did choose this house to be called by your name, to be a house of prayer and supplication for your
people:
 <span class="verse"> 38</span><a name="C7V38">&nbsp;</a>take vengeance on this man and his army, and let them fall by the sword: remember their blasphemies,
and suffer them not to live any longer.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 39</span><a name="C7V39">&nbsp;</a>And Nicanor went forth from Jerusalem, and encamped in Bethhoron, and there met him the host of Syria.
 <span class="verse"> 40</span><a name="C7V40">&nbsp;</a>And Judas encamped in Adasa with three thousand men: and Judas prayed and said,
 <span class="verse"> 41</span><a name="C7V41">&nbsp;</a>When they that came from the king blasphemed, your angel went out, and struck among them a hundred and
fourscore and five thousand.
 <span class="verse"> 42</span><a name="C7V42">&nbsp;</a>Even so discomfit you this army before us today, and let all the rest know that he has spoken wickedly
against your sanctuary, and judge you him according to his wickedness.
 <span class="verse"> 43</span><a name="C7V43">&nbsp;</a>And on the thirteenth day of the month Adar the armies joined battle: and Nicanor’s army was discomfited,
and he himself was the first to fall in the battle.
 <span class="verse"> 44</span><a name="C7V44">&nbsp;</a>Now when his army saw that Nicanor was fallen, they cast away their arms, and fled.
 <span class="verse"> 45</span><a name="C7V45">&nbsp;</a>And they pursued after them a day’s journey from Adasa until you come to

 closed them in; and these turned them back on those, and they all fell by the sword, and there was not
one of them left.
 <span class="verse"> 47</span><a name="C7V47">&nbsp;</a>And they took the spoils, and the booty, and they struck off Nicanor’s head, and his right hand, which
he stretched out so haughtily, and brought them, and

 hanged them up beside Jerusalem.
