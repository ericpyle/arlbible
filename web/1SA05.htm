 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C5V1">&nbsp;</a>Now the Philistines had taken God’s ark, and they brought it from Ebenezer to Ashdod.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C5V2">&nbsp;</a>The Philistines took God’s ark, and brought it into the house of Dagon, and set it by Dagon.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C5V3">&nbsp;</a>When the people of Ashdod arose early on the next day, behold, Dagon had fallen on his face to the ground
before Yahweh’s ark. They took Dagon, and set him in his place again.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C5V4">&nbsp;</a>When they arose early on the following morning, behold, Dagon had fallen on his face to the ground before
Yahweh’s ark; and the head of Dagon and both the palms of his hands were cut off on the threshold. Only
Dagon’s torso was intact.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C5V5">&nbsp;</a>Therefore neither the priests of Dagon, nor any who come into Dagon’s house, step on the threshold of
Dagon in Ashdod, to this day.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C5V6">&nbsp;</a>But Yahweh’s hand was heavy on the people of Ashdod, and he destroyed them, and struck them with tumors,
even Ashdod and its borders.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C5V7">&nbsp;</a>When the men of Ashdod saw that it was so, they said, “The ark of the God of Israel shall not stay with
us; for his hand is severe on us, and on Dagon our god.”
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C5V8">&nbsp;</a>They sent therefore and gathered together all the lords of the Philistines, and said, “What shall we
do with the ark of the God of Israel?”
</div>
<div class="p">They answered, “Let the ark of the God of Israel be carried over to Gath.” They carried the ark of the
God of Israel there.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C5V9">&nbsp;</a>It was so, that after they had carried it there, Yahweh’s hand was against the city with a very great
confusion; and he struck the men of the city, both small and great so that tumors broke out on them.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C5V10">&nbsp;</a>So they sent God’s ark to Ekron.
</div>
<div class="p">As God’s ark came to Ekron, the Ekronites cried out, saying, “They have brought about the ark of the
God of Israel to us, to kill us and our people.”
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C5V11">&nbsp;</a>They sent therefore and gathered together all the lords of the Philistines, and they said, “Send the
ark of the God of Israel away, and let it go again to its own place, that it not kill us and our people.”
For there was a deadly confusion throughout all the city. The hand of God was very heavy there.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C5V12">&nbsp;</a>The men who didn’t die were struck with the tumors; and the cry of the city went up to heaven.
