<div class="chapterlabel"> 1</div><div class="p">
 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C1V1">&nbsp;</a>THE second book of the prophet Esdras, Saraias, the son of Azaraias, the son of Helkias, the son of Salemas,
the son of Sadoc, the son of Ahitob,
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C1V2">&nbsp;</a>the son of Achias, the son of Phinees, the son of Heli, the son of Amarias, the son of Aziei, the son
of Marimoth, the son of Arna, the son of Ozias, the son of Borith, the son of Abissei, the son of Phinees,
the son of Eleazar,
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C1V3">&nbsp;</a>the son of Aaron, of the tribe of Levi; which was captive in the land of the Medes, in the reign of Artaxerxes
king of the Persians.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C1V4">&nbsp;</a>And the word of the Lord came to me, saying,
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C1V5">&nbsp;</a>Go your way, and show my people their sinful deeds, and their children their wickedness which they have
done against me; that they may tell their children’s children:
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C1V6">&nbsp;</a>because the sins of their fathers are increased in them: for they have forgotten me, and have done sacrifice
to strange gods.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C1V7">&nbsp;</a>Did I not bring them out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage? but they have provoked me
to wrath, and have despised my counsels.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C1V8">&nbsp;</a>Shake you then the hair of your head, and cast all evils upon them, for they have not been obedient to
my law, but it is a rebellious people.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C1V9">&nbsp;</a>How long shall I forbear them, to whom I have done so much good?
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C1V10">&nbsp;</a>I have overthrown many kings for their sakes; I have struck down Pharoah with his servants and all his
host.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C1V11">&nbsp;</a>I have destroyed all the nations before them, and in the east I have scattered the people of two provinces,
even of Tyre and Sidon, and have slain all their adversaries.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C1V12">&nbsp;</a>Speak therefore to them, saying,
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C1V13">&nbsp;</a>Thus says the Lord, of a truth I brought you through the sea, and where there was no path I made for
you highways; I gave you Moses for a leader, and Aaron for a priest.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C1V14">&nbsp;</a>I gave you light in a pillar of fire, and great wonders have I done among you; yet have you⌃ forgotten
me, says the Lord.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C1V15">&nbsp;</a>Thus says the Lord Almighty, The quails were for a token to you; I gave you a camp for your safeguard,
nevertheless you⌃ murmured there:
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C1V16">&nbsp;</a>and you⌃ triumphed not in my name for the destruction of your enemies, but ever to this day do you⌃ yet
murmur.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C1V17">&nbsp;</a>Where are the benefits that I have done for you? when you⌃ were hungry and thirsty in the wilderness,
did you⌃ not cry to me,
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C1V18">&nbsp;</a>saying, Why have you brought us into this wilderness to kill us? it had been better for us to have served
the Egyptians, than to die in this wilderness.
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C1V19">&nbsp;</a>I had pity upon your mournings, and gave you manna for food; you⌃ did eat angels’ bread.
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C1V20">&nbsp;</a>Wnen you⌃ were thirsty, did I not cleave the rock, and waters flowed out to your fill? for the heat I
covered you with the leaves of the trees.
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C1V21">&nbsp;</a>I divided among you fruitful lands; I cast out the Canaanites, the Pherezites, and the Philistines, before
you: what shall I yet do more for you? says the Lord.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C1V22">&nbsp;</a>Thus says the Lord Almighty, When you⌃ were in the wilderness, at the bitter river, being thirsty, and
blaspheming my name,
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C1V23">&nbsp;</a>I gave you not fire for your blasphemies, but cast a tree in the water, and made the river sweet.
 <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C1V24">&nbsp;</a>What shall I do to you, O Jacob? you, Judah, would not obey me: I will turn me to other nations, and
to them will I give my name, that they may keep my statutes.
 <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C1V25">&nbsp;</a>Seeing you⌃ have forsaken me, I also will forsake you; when you⌃ ask me to be merciful to you, I will
have no mercy upon you.
 <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C1V26">&nbsp;</a>Whenever you⌃ shall call upon me, I will not hear you: for you⌃ have defiled your hands with blood, and
your feet are swift to commit manslaughter.
 <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C1V27">&nbsp;</a>You⌃ have not as it were forsaken me, but your own selves, says the Lord.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C1V28">&nbsp;</a>Thus says the Lord Almighty, Have I not prayed you as a father his sons, as a mother her daughters, and
a nurse her young babes,
 <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C1V29">&nbsp;</a>that you⌃ would be my people, and I should be your God; that you⌃ would be my children, and I should
be your father?
 <span class="verse"> 30</span><a name="C1V30">&nbsp;</a>I gathered you together, as a hen
<span class="add">gathers
</span> her chickens under her wings: but now, what shall I do to you? I will cast you out from my presence.
 <span class="verse"> 31</span><a name="C1V31">&nbsp;</a>When you⌃ offer oblations to me, I will turn my face from you: for your solemn feast days, your new moons,
and your circumcisions of the flesh, have I rejected.
 <span class="verse"> 32</span><a name="C1V32">&nbsp;</a>I sent to you my servants the prophets, whom you⌃ have taken and slain, and torn their bodies in pieces,
whose blood I will require
<span class="add">of your hands,
</span> says the Lord.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 33</span><a name="C1V33">&nbsp;</a>Thus says the Lord Almighty, Your house is desolate, I will cast you out as the wind does stubble.
 <span class="verse"> 34</span><a name="C1V34">&nbsp;</a>And your children shall not be fruitful; for they have neglected my commandment
<a href="#FN1"><span class="notemark">*</span><span class="popup">Or,
together with you
</span></a>
 to you, and done that which is evil before me.
 <span class="verse"> 35</span><a name="C1V35">&nbsp;</a>Your houses will I give to a people that shall come; which not having heard of me yet believe me; they
to whom I have showed no signs shall do that which I have commanded.
 <span class="verse"> 36</span><a name="C1V36">&nbsp;</a>They have seen no prophets, yet they shall call their former estate to remembrance.
 <span class="verse"> 37</span><a name="C1V37">&nbsp;</a>I take to witness the grace of the people that shall come, whose little ones rejoice with gladness: and
though they see me not with bodily eyes, yet in spirit they shall believe the thing that I say.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 38</span><a name="C1V38">&nbsp;</a>And now, O father, behold with glory; and see the people that come from the east:
 <span class="verse"> 39</span><a name="C1V39">&nbsp;</a>to whom I will give for leaders, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, Oseas, Amos, and Micheas, Joel, Abdias, and
Jonas,
 <span class="verse"> 40</span><a name="C1V40">&nbsp;</a>Nahum, and Abacuc, Sophonias, Aggaeus, Zachary, and Malachy, which is called also the angel of the Lord.
