 <span class="verse" id="V1">1&nbsp;</span>Queen Esther also, being seized <span class='add'>as it were </span> with the agony of death, resorted to the Lord:  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span>and laid away her glorious apparel, and put on the garments of anguish and mourning: and instead of the most excellent ointments, she covered her head with ashes and dung, and she humbled her body greatly, and all the places of the ornaments of her joy she covered with her tangled hair.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>And she prayed to the Lord, the God of Israel, saying, O my Lord, you only are our King: help me that am desolate and have no other helper but you:  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>for my danger is in my hand.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>From my youth up I have heard in the tribe of my family, that you, O Lord, took Israel from among all the nations, and our fathers from all their progenitors, for a perpetual inheritance, and did perform for them whatever you did promise.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>And now we have sinned before you, and you have given us into the hands of our enemies,  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>because we glorified their gods: O Lord, you are righteous.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>Nevertheless it satisfies them not, that we are in bitter captivity: but they have stricken hands with their idols,  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>that they will abolish the thing that you with your mouth have ordained, and destroy your inheritance, and stop the mouth of them that praise you, and quench the glory of your house, and your altar,  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>and open the mouths of the heathen to set forth the virtues of <a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> Gr. vain things. </span></a> idols, and that a fleshly king will be magnified forever.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>O Lord, give not your sceptre to them that be nothing, and let them not laugh at our fall; but turn their device upon themselves, and make him an example, that has begun this against us.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>Remember, O Lord, make yourself known in the time of our affliction, and give me boldness, O King of the gods, and holder of all dominion.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>Give me eloquent speech in my mouth before the lion: and turn his heart to hate him that fights against us, that there may be an end of him, and of them that are like-minded with him:  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>but deliver us with your hand, and help me that am desolate and have no other <span class='add'>helper </span> but you, O Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>You have knowledge of all things; and you know that I hate the glory of the wicked, and abhor the bed of the uncircumcised, and of every alien.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>You know my necessity: that I abhor the sign of my high estate, which is upon my head in the days wherein I show myself. I abhor it as a menstruous rag, and I wear it not when I am private by myself.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>And your handmaid has not eaten at Aman’s table, neither have I honored the king’s feast, nor drunk the wine of the drink offerings.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>Neither had your handmaid any joy since the day that I was brought hither to this present, but in you, O Lord, you God of Abraham.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>O God, that are mighty above all, hear the voice of the forlorn, and deliver us out of the hands of the mischievous, and deliver me out of my fear. </div><ul class='tnav'>
