<div class="chapterlabel"> 26</div><div class="p">
 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C26V1">&nbsp;</a>In the eleventh year, in the first of the month, Yahweh’s word came to me, saying,
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C26V2">&nbsp;</a>“Son of man, because Tyre has said against Jerusalem, ‘Aha! She is broken! She who was the gateway of
the peoples has been returned to me. I will be replenished, now that she is laid waste;’
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C26V3">&nbsp;</a>therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh, ‘Behold, I am against you, Tyre, and will cause many nations to
come up against you, as the sea causes its waves to come up.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C26V4">&nbsp;</a>They will destroy the walls of Tyre, and break down her towers. I will also scrape her dust from her,
and make her a bare rock.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C26V5">&nbsp;</a>She will be a place for the spreading of nets in the middle of the sea; for I have spoken it,’ says the
Lord Yahweh. ‘She will become plunder for the nations.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C26V6">&nbsp;</a>Her daughters who are in the field will be slain with the sword: and they will know that I am Yahweh.’
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C26V7">&nbsp;</a>“For thus says the Lord Yahweh: ‘Behold, I will bring on Tyre Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, king of
kings, from the north, with horses, and with chariots, and with horsemen, and a company, and many people.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C26V8">&nbsp;</a>He will kill your daughters in the field with the sword; and he will make forts against you, and cast
up a mound against you, and raise up the buckler against you.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C26V9">&nbsp;</a>He will set his battering engines against your walls, and with his axes he will break down your towers.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C26V10">&nbsp;</a>By reason of the abundance of his horses their dust will cover you: your walls will shake at the noise
of the horsemen, and of the wagons, and of the chariots, when he enters into your gates, as men enter
into a city in which is made a breach.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C26V11">&nbsp;</a>With the hoofs of his horses he will tread down all your streets. He will kill your people with the sword;
and the pillars of your strength will go down to the ground.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C26V12">&nbsp;</a>They will make a plunder of your riches, and make a prey of your merchandise; and they will break down
your walls, and destroy your pleasant houses; and they will lay your stones and your timber and your
dust in the middle of the waters.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C26V13">&nbsp;</a>I will cause the noise of your songs to cease; and the sound of your harps won’t be heard any more.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C26V14">&nbsp;</a>I will make you a bare rock; you will be a place for the spreading of nets; you will be built no more:
for I Yahweh have spoken it,’ says the Lord Yahweh.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C26V15">&nbsp;</a>“Thus says the Lord Yahweh to Tyre: ‘Won’t the islands shake at the sound of your fall, when the wounded
groan, when the slaughter is made within you?
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C26V16">&nbsp;</a>Then all the princes of the sea will come down from their thrones, and lay aside their robes, and strip
off their embroidered garments: they will clothe themselves with trembling; they will sit on the ground,
and will tremble every moment, and be astonished at you.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C26V17">&nbsp;</a>They will take up a lamentation over you, and tell you,
</div>
<div class="q1">How you are destroyed,
</div>
<div class="q2">who were inhabited by seafaring men,
</div>
<div class="q1">the renowned city,
</div>
<div class="q2">who was strong in the sea,
</div>
<div class="q1">she and her inhabitants,
</div>
<div class="q2">who caused their terror to be on all who lived there!
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C26V18">&nbsp;</a>Now the islands will tremble in the day of your fall.
</div>
<div class="q2">Yes, the islands that are in the sea will be dismayed at your departure.’
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C26V19">&nbsp;</a>“For thus says the Lord Yahweh: ‘When I make you a desolate city, like the cities that are not inhabited;
when I bring up the deep on you, and the great waters cover you;
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C26V20">&nbsp;</a>then I will bring you down with those who descend into the pit, to the people of old time, and will make
you to dwell in the lower parts of the earth, in the places that are desolate of old, with those who
go down to the pit, that you be not inhabited; and I will set glory in the land of the living:
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C26V21">&nbsp;</a>I will make you a terror, and you will no more have any being; though you are sought for, yet you will
never be found again,’ says the Lord Yahweh.”
