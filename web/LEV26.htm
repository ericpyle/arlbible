 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C26V4">&nbsp;</a>then I will give you your rains in their season, and the land shall yield its increase, and the trees
of the field shall yield their fruit.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C26V5">&nbsp;</a>Your threshing shall reach to the vintage, and the vintage shall reach to the sowing time. You shall
eat your bread to the full, and dwell in your land safely.

 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C26V11">&nbsp;</a>I will set my tent among you, and my soul won’t abhor you.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C26V12">&nbsp;</a>I will walk among you, and will be your God, and you will be my people.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C26V13">&nbsp;</a>I am Yahweh your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, that you should not be their slaves.
I have broken the bars of your yoke, and made you go upright.

my commandments, but break my covenant;
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C26V16">&nbsp;</a>I also will do this to you: I will appoint terror over you, even consumption and fever, that shall consume
the eyes, and make the soul to pine away. You will sow your seed in vain, for your enemies will eat it.

within your cities, and I will send the pestilence among you. You will be delivered into the hand of
the enemy.

bodies of your idols; and my soul will abhor you.
 <span class="verse"> 31</span><a name="C26V31">&nbsp;</a>I will lay your cities waste, and will bring your sanctuaries to desolation. I will not take delight
in the sweet fragrance of your offerings.
 <span class="verse"> 32</span><a name="C26V32">&nbsp;</a>I will bring the land into desolation; and your enemies that dwell therein will be astonished at it.

<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 36</span><a name="C26V36">&nbsp;</a>“‘As for those of you who are left, I will send a faintness into their hearts in the lands of their enemies.
The sound of a driven leaf will put them to flight; and they shall flee, as one flees from the sword.
They will fall when no one pursues.
 <span class="verse"> 37</span><a name="C26V37">&nbsp;</a>They will stumble over one another, as it were before the sword, when no one pursues. You will have no
power to stand before your enemies.
 <span class="verse"> 38</span><a name="C26V38">&nbsp;</a>You will perish among the nations. The land of your enemies will eat you up.
 <span class="verse"> 39</span><a name="C26V39">&nbsp;</a>Those of you who are left will pine away in their iniquity in your enemies’ lands; and also in the iniquities
of their fathers they shall pine away with them.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 40</span><a name="C26V40">&nbsp;</a>“‘If they confess their iniquity, and the iniquity of their fathers, in their trespass which they trespassed
against me, and also that, because they walked contrary to me,
 <span class="verse"> 41</span><a name="C26V41">&nbsp;</a>I also walked contrary to them, and brought them into the land of their enemies; if then their uncircumcised
heart is humbled, and they then accept the punishment of their iniquity;
 <span class="verse"> 42</span><a name="C26V42">&nbsp;</a>then I will remember my covenant with Jacob; and also my covenant with Isaac, and also my covenant with
Abraham; and I will remember the land.
 <span class="verse"> 43</span><a name="C26V43">&nbsp;</a>The land also will be left by them, and will enjoy its Sabbaths while it lies desolate without them:
and they will accept the punishment of their iniquity; because, even because they rejected my ordinances,
and their soul abhorred my statutes.
 <span class="verse"> 44</span><a name="C26V44">&nbsp;</a>Yet for all that, when they are in the land of their enemies, I will not reject them, neither will I
abhor them, to destroy them utterly, and to break my covenant with them; for I am Yahweh their God;
 <span class="verse"> 45</span><a name="C26V45">&nbsp;</a>but I will for their sake remember the covenant of their ancestors, whom I brought out of the land of
Egypt in the sight of the nations, that I might be their God. I am Yahweh.’”

<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 46</span><a name="C26V46">&nbsp;</a>These are the statutes, ordinances and laws, which Yahweh made between him and the children of Israel
in Mount Sinai by Moses.
