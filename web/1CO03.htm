 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C3V1">&nbsp;</a>Brothers, I couldn’t speak to you as to spiritual, but as to fleshly, as to babies in Christ.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C3V2">&nbsp;</a>I fed you with milk, not with meat; for you weren’t yet ready. Indeed, not even now are you ready,
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C3V3">&nbsp;</a>for you are still fleshly. For insofar as there is jealousy, strife, and factions among you, aren’t you
fleshly, and don’t you walk in the ways of men?
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C3V4">&nbsp;</a>For when one says, “I follow Paul,” and another, “I follow Apollos,” aren’t you fleshly?
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C3V5">&nbsp;</a>Who then is Apollos, and who is Paul, but servants through whom you believed; and each as the Lord gave
to him?
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C3V6">&nbsp;</a>I planted. Apollos watered. But God gave the increase.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C3V7">&nbsp;</a>So then neither he who plants is anything, nor he who waters, but God who gives the increase.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C3V8">&nbsp;</a>Now he who plants and he who waters are the same, but each will receive his own reward according to his
own labor.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C3V9">&nbsp;</a>For we are God’s fellow workers. You are God’s farming, God’s building.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C3V10">&nbsp;</a>According to the grace of God which was given to me, as a wise master builder I laid a foundation, and
another builds on it. But let each man be careful how he builds on it.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C3V11">&nbsp;</a>For no one can lay any other foundation than that which has been laid, which is Jesus Christ.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C3V12">&nbsp;</a>But if anyone builds on the foundation with gold, silver, costly stones, wood, hay, or stubble;
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C3V13">&nbsp;</a>each man’s work will be revealed. For the Day will declare it, because it is revealed in fire; and the
fire itself will test what sort of work each man’s work is.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C3V14">&nbsp;</a>If any man’s work remains which he built on it, he will receive a reward.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C3V15">&nbsp;</a>If any man’s work is burned, he will suffer loss, but he himself will be saved, but as through fire.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C3V16">&nbsp;</a>Don’t you know that you are a temple of God, and that God’s Spirit lives in you?
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C3V17">&nbsp;</a>If anyone destroys God’s temple, God will destroy him; for God’s temple is holy, which you are.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C3V18">&nbsp;</a>Let no one deceive himself. If anyone thinks that he is wise among you in this world, let him become
a fool, that he may become wise.
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C3V19">&nbsp;</a>For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For it is written, “He has taken the wise in their
craftiness.”<a href="#FN1"><span class="notemark"></span><span class="popup">+ Job 5:13</span></a>
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C3V20">&nbsp;</a>And again, “The Lord knows the reasoning of the wise, that it is worthless.”<a href="#FN2"><span class="notemark"></span><span class="popup">+ Psalm 94:11</span></a>
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C3V21">&nbsp;</a>Therefore let no one boast in men. For all things are yours,
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C3V22">&nbsp;</a>whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to
come. All are yours,
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C3V23">&nbsp;</a>and you are Christ’s, and Christ is God’s.
