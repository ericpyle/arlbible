 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C25V1">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">“Then the Kingdom of Heaven will be like ten virgins, who took their lamps, and went out to meet the
bridegroom.
</span> <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C25V2">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Five of them were foolish, and five were wise.
</span> <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C25V3">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Those who were foolish, when they took their lamps, took no oil with them,
</span> <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C25V4">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">but the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps.
</span> <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C25V5">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Now while the bridegroom delayed, they all slumbered and slept.
</span> <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C25V6">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">But at midnight there was a cry, ‘Behold! The bridegroom is coming! Come out to meet him!’
</span> <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C25V7">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Then all those virgins arose, and trimmed their lamps.</span><a href="#FN1"><span class="notemark">*</span><span class="popup">The end of the wick of an oil lamp needs to be cut off periodically to avoid having it become clogged
with carbon deposits. The wick height is also adjusted so that the flame burns evenly and gives good
light without producing a lot of smoke.</span></a>
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C25V8">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">The foolish said to the wise, ‘Give us some of your oil, for our lamps are going out.’
</span> <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C25V9">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">But the wise answered, saying, ‘What if there isn’t enough for us and you? You go rather to those who
sell, and buy for yourselves.’
</span> <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C25V10">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">While they went away to buy, the bridegroom came, and those who were ready went in with him to the marriage
feast, and the door was shut.
</span> <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C25V11">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Afterward the other virgins also came, saying, ‘Lord, Lord, open to us.’
</span> <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C25V12">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">But he answered, ‘Most certainly I tell you, I don’t know you.’
</span> <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C25V13">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Watch therefore, for you don’t know the day nor the hour in which the Son of Man is coming.</span></div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C25V14">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">“For it is like a man, going into another country, who called his own servants, and entrusted his goods
to them.
</span> <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C25V15">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">To one he gave five talents,<a href="#FN2"><span class="notemark">†</span><span class="popup">A talent is about 30 kilograms or 66 pounds (usually used to weigh silver unless otherwise specified)</span></a>
 to another two, to another one; to each according to his own ability. Then he went on his journey.
</span> <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C25V16">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Immediately he who received the five talents went and traded with them, and made another five talents.
</span> <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C25V17">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">In the same way, he also who got the two gained another two.
</span> <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C25V18">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">But he who received the one talent went away and dug in the earth, and hid his lord’s money.</span></div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C25V19">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">“Now after a long time the lord of those servants came, and reconciled accounts with them.
</span> <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C25V20">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">He who received the five talents came and brought another five talents, saying, ‘Lord, you delivered
to me five talents. Behold, I have gained another five talents besides them.’</span></div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C25V21">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">“His lord said to him, ‘Well done, good and faithful servant. You have been faithful over a few things,
I will set you over many things. Enter into the joy of your lord.’</span></div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C25V22">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">“He also who got the two talents came and said, ‘Lord, you delivered to me two talents. Behold, I have
gained another two talents besides them.’
</span></div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C25V23">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">“His lord said to him, ‘Well done, good and faithful servant. You have been faithful over a few things,
I will set you over many things. Enter into the joy of your lord.’</span></div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C25V24">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">“He also who had received the one talent came and said, ‘Lord, I knew you that you are a hard man, reaping
where you did not sow, and gathering where you did not scatter.
</span> <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C25V25">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">I was afraid, and went away and hid your talent in the earth. Behold, you have what is yours.’</span></div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C25V26">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">“But his lord answered him, ‘You wicked and slothful servant. You knew that I reap where I didn’t sow,
and gather where I didn’t scatter.
</span> <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C25V27">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">You ought therefore to have deposited my money with the bankers, and at my coming I should have received
back my own with interest.
</span> <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C25V28">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Take away therefore the talent from him, and give it to him who has the ten talents.
</span> <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C25V29">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">For to everyone who has will be given, and he will have abundance, but from him who doesn’t have, even
that which he has will be taken away.
</span> <span class="verse"> 30</span><a name="C25V30">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Throw out the unprofitable servant into the outer darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing
of teeth.’</span></div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 31</span><a name="C25V31">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">“But when the Son of Man comes in his glory, and all the holy angels with him, then he will sit on the
throne of his glory.
</span> <span class="verse"> 32</span><a name="C25V32">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Before him all the nations will be gathered, and he will separate them one from another, as a shepherd
separates the sheep from the goats.
</span> <span class="verse"> 33</span><a name="C25V33">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">He will set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on the left.
</span> <span class="verse"> 34</span><a name="C25V34">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Then the King will tell those on his right hand, ‘Come, blessed of my Father, inherit the Kingdom prepared
for you from the foundation of the world;
</span> <span class="verse"> 35</span><a name="C25V35">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">for I was hungry, and you gave me food to eat. I was thirsty, and you gave me drink. I was a stranger,
and you took me in.
</span> <span class="verse"> 36</span><a name="C25V36">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">I was naked, and you clothed me. I was sick, and you visited me. I was in prison, and you came to me.’</span></div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 37</span><a name="C25V37">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">“Then the righteous will answer him, saying, ‘Lord, when did we see you hungry, and feed you; or thirsty,
and give you a drink?
</span> <span class="verse"> 38</span><a name="C25V38">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">When did we see you as a stranger, and take you in; or naked, and clothe you?
</span> <span class="verse"> 39</span><a name="C25V39">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">When did we see you sick, or in prison, and come to you?’</span></div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 40</span><a name="C25V40">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">“The King will answer them, ‘Most certainly I tell you, because you did it to one of the least of these
my brothers,</span><a href="#FN3"><span class="notemark">‡</span><span class="popup">The word for “brothers” here may be also correctly translated “brothers and sisters” or “siblings.”</span></a>
<span class="wj"> you did it to me.’
</span> <span class="verse"> 41</span><a name="C25V41">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Then he will say also to those on the left hand, ‘Depart from me, you cursed, into the eternal fire which
is prepared for the devil and his angels;
</span> <span class="verse"> 42</span><a name="C25V42">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">for I was hungry, and you didn’t give me food to eat; I was thirsty, and you gave me no drink;
</span> <span class="verse"> 43</span><a name="C25V43">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">I was a stranger, and you didn’t take me in; naked, and you didn’t clothe me; sick, and in prison, and
you didn’t visit me.’</span></div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 44</span><a name="C25V44">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">“Then they will also answer, saying, ‘Lord, when did we see you hungry, or thirsty, or a stranger, or
naked, or sick, or in prison, and didn’t help you?’</span></div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 45</span><a name="C25V45">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">“Then he will answer them, saying, ‘Most certainly I tell you, because you didn’t do it to one of the
least of these, you didn’t do it to me.’
</span> <span class="verse"> 46</span><a name="C25V46">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">These will go away into eternal punishment, but the righteous into eternal life.”</span></div>
