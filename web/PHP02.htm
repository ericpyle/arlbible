<div><a name="C2V0"><hr></a>
<div class="chapterlabel"> 2</div><div class="p">
 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C2V1">&nbsp;</a>If there is therefore any exhortation in Christ, if any consolation of love, if any fellowship of the
Spirit, if any tender mercies and compassion,
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C2V2">&nbsp;</a>make my joy full, by being like-minded, having the same love, being of one accord, of one mind;
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C2V3">&nbsp;</a>doing nothing through rivalry or through conceit, but in humility, each counting others better than himself;
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C2V4">&nbsp;</a>each of you not just looking to his own things, but each of you also to the things of others.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C2V5">&nbsp;</a>Have this in your mind, which was also in Christ Jesus,
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C2V6">&nbsp;</a>who, existing in the form of God, didn’t consider equality with God a thing to be grasped,
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C2V7">&nbsp;</a>but emptied himself, taking the form of a servant, being made in the likeness of men.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C2V8">&nbsp;</a>And being found in human form, he humbled himself, becoming obedient to death, yes, the death of the
cross.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C2V9">&nbsp;</a>Therefore God also highly exalted him, and gave to him the name which is above every name;
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C2V10">&nbsp;</a>that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of those in heaven, those on earth, and those under
the earth,
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C2V11">&nbsp;</a>and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C2V12">&nbsp;</a>So then, my beloved, even as you have always obeyed, not only in my presence, but now much more in my
absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C2V13">&nbsp;</a>For it is God who works in you both to will and to work, for his good pleasure.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C2V14">&nbsp;</a>Do all things without murmurings and disputes,
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C2V15">&nbsp;</a>that you may become blameless and harmless, children of God without defect in the middle of a crooked
and perverse generation, among whom you are seen as lights in the world,
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C2V16">&nbsp;</a>holding up the word of life; that I may have something to boast in the day of Christ, that I didn’t run
in vain nor labor in vain.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C2V17">&nbsp;</a>Yes, and if I am poured out on the sacrifice and service of your faith, I rejoice, and rejoice with you
all.
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C2V18">&nbsp;</a>In the same way, you also rejoice, and rejoice with me.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C2V19">&nbsp;</a>But I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy to you soon, that I also may be cheered up when I know how
you are doing.
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C2V20">&nbsp;</a>For I have no one else like-minded, who will truly care about you.
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C2V21">&nbsp;</a>For they all seek their own, not the things of Jesus Christ.
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C2V22">&nbsp;</a>But you know the proof of him, that, as a child serves a father, so he served with me in furtherance
of the Good News.
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C2V23">&nbsp;</a>Therefore I hope to send him at once, as soon as I see how it will go with me.
 <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C2V24">&nbsp;</a>But I trust in the Lord that I myself also will come shortly.
 <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C2V25">&nbsp;</a>But I counted it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother, fellow worker, fellow soldier, and
your apostle and servant of my need;
 <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C2V26">&nbsp;</a>since he longed for you all, and was very troubled, because you had heard that he was sick.
 <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C2V27">&nbsp;</a>For indeed he was sick, nearly to death, but God had mercy on him; and not on him only, but on me also,
that I might not have sorrow on sorrow.
 <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C2V28">&nbsp;</a>I have sent him therefore the more diligently, that, when you see him again, you may rejoice, and that
I may be the less sorrowful.
 <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C2V29">&nbsp;</a>Receive him therefore in the Lord with all joy, and hold such in honor,
 <span class="verse"> 30</span><a name="C2V30">&nbsp;</a>because for the work of Christ he came near to death, risking his life to supply that which was lacking
in your service toward me.
