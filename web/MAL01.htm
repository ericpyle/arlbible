 word to Israel by Malachi.

<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C1V2">&nbsp;</a>“I have loved you,” says Yahweh.
</div>
<div class="p">Yet you say, “How have you loved us?”
</div>
<div class="p">“Wasn’t Esau Jacob’s brother?” says Yahweh, “Yet I loved Jacob;
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C1V3">&nbsp;</a>but Esau I hated, and made his mountains a desolation, and gave his heritage to the jackals of the wilderness.”
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C1V4">&nbsp;</a>Whereas Edom says, “We are beaten down, but we will return and build the waste places”; Yahweh of Armies
says, “They shall build, but I will throw down; and men will call them ‘The Wicked Land,’ even the people
against whom Yahweh shows wrath forever.”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C1V5">&nbsp;</a>Your eyes will see, and you will say, “Yahweh is great—even beyond the border of Israel!”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C1V6">&nbsp;</a>“A son honors his father, and a servant his master. If I am a father, then where is my honor? And if
I am a master, where is the respect due me? Says Yahweh of Armies to you, priests, who despise my name.
You say, ‘How have we despised your name?’
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C1V7">&nbsp;</a>You offer polluted bread on my altar. You say, ‘How have we polluted you?’ In that you say, ‘Yahweh’s
table is contemptible.’
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C1V8">&nbsp;</a>When you offer the blind for sacrifice, isn’t that evil? And when you offer the lame and sick, isn’t
that evil? Present it now to your governor! Will he be pleased with you? Or will he accept your person?”
says Yahweh of Armies.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C1V9">&nbsp;</a>“Now, please entreat the favor of God,<a href="#FN2"><span class="notemark">†</span><span class="popup">The Hebrew word rendered “God” is “אֱלֹהִ֑ים” (Elohim).</span></a>
 that he may be gracious to us. With this, will he accept any of you?” says Yahweh of Armies.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C1V10">&nbsp;</a>“Oh that there were one among you who would shut the doors, that you might not kindle fire on my altar
in vain! I have no pleasure in you,” says Yahweh of Armies, “neither will I accept an offering at your
hand.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C1V11">&nbsp;</a>For from the rising of the sun even to the going down of the same, my name is great among the nations,
and in every place incense will be offered to my name, and a pure offering: for my name is great among
the nations,” says Yahweh of Armies.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C1V12">&nbsp;</a>“But you profane it, in that you say, ‘Yahweh’s table is polluted, and its fruit, even its food, is contemptible.’
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C1V13">&nbsp;</a>You say also, ‘Behold,<a href="#FN3"><span class="notemark">‡</span><span class="popup">“Behold”, from “הִנֵּה”, means look at, take notice, observe, see, or gaze at. It is often used as an

 what a weariness it is!’ and you have sniffed at it”, says Yahweh of Armies; “and you have brought that
which was taken by violence, the lame, and the sick; thus you bring the offering. Should I accept this
at your hand?” says Yahweh.
</div>

nations.”
