 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C11V1">&nbsp;</a>“As for me, in the first year of Darius the Mede, I stood up to confirm and strengthen him.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C11V2">&nbsp;</a>“Now will I show you the truth. Behold, three more kings will stand up in Persia; and the fourth will
be far richer than all of them. When he has grown strong through his riches, he will stir up all against
the realm of Greece.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C11V3">&nbsp;</a>A mighty king will stand up, who will rule with great dominion, and do according to his will.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C11V4">&nbsp;</a>When he stands up, his kingdom will be broken, and will be divided toward the four winds of the sky,
but not to his posterity, nor according to his dominion with which he ruled; for his kingdom will be
plucked up, even for others besides these.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C11V5">&nbsp;</a>“The king of the south will be strong. One of his princes will become stronger than him, and have dominion.
His dominion will be a great dominion.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C11V6">&nbsp;</a>At the end of years they will join themselves together; and the daughter of the king of the south will
come to the king of the north to make an agreement; but she will not retain the strength of her arm;
neither will he stand, nor his arm; but she will be given up, with those who brought her, and he who
became the father of her, and he who strengthened her in those times.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C11V7">&nbsp;</a>“But out of a shoot from her roots one will stand up in his place, who will come to the army, and will
enter into the fortress of the king of the north, and will deal against them, and will prevail.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C11V8">&nbsp;</a>Also their gods, with their molten images, and with their goodly vessels of silver and of gold, will
he carry captive into Egypt; and he will refrain some years from the king of the north.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C11V9">&nbsp;</a>He will come into the realm of the king of the south, but he will return into his own land.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C11V10">&nbsp;</a>His sons will wage war, and will assemble a multitude of great forces, which will come on, and overflow,
and pass through; and they will return and wage war, even to his fortress.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C11V11">&nbsp;</a>“The king of the south will be moved with anger, and will come out and fight with him, even with the
king of the north; and he will send out a great multitude, and the multitude will be given into his hand.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C11V12">&nbsp;</a>The multitude will be lifted up, and his heart will be exalted; and he will cast down tens of thousands,
but he won’t prevail.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C11V13">&nbsp;</a>The king of the north will return, and will send out a multitude greater than the former; and he will
come on at the end of the times, even of years, with a great army and with much substance.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C11V14">&nbsp;</a>“In those times many will stand up against the king of the south: also the children of the violent among
your people will lift themselves up to establish the vision; but they will fall.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C11V15">&nbsp;</a>So the king of the north will come, and cast up a mound, and take a well-fortified city: and the forces
of the south won’t stand, neither his chosen people, neither will there be any strength to stand.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C11V16">&nbsp;</a>But he who comes against him will do according to his own will, and no one will stand before him; and
he will stand in the glorious land, and destruction will be in his hand.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C11V17">&nbsp;</a>He will set his face to come with the strength of his whole kingdom, and with him equitable conditions;
and he will perform them. He will give him the daughter of women, to corrupt her; but she will not stand,
neither be for him.
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C11V18">&nbsp;</a>After this he will turn his face to the islands, and will take many; but a prince will cause the reproach
offered by him to cease; yes, moreover, he will cause his reproach to turn on him.
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C11V19">&nbsp;</a>Then he will turn his face toward the fortresses of his own land; but he will stumble and fall, and won’t
be found.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C11V20">&nbsp;</a>“Then one who will cause a tax collector to pass through the kingdom to maintain its glory will stand
up in his place; but within few days he shall be destroyed, neither in anger, nor in battle.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C11V21">&nbsp;</a>“In his place a contemptible person will stand up, to whom they had not given the honor of the kingdom:
but he will come in time of security, and will obtain the kingdom by flatteries.
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C11V22">&nbsp;</a>The overwhelming forces will be overwhelmed from before him, and will be broken; yes, also the prince
of the covenant.
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C11V23">&nbsp;</a>After the treaty made with him he will work deceitfully; for he will come up, and will become strong,
with a small people.
 <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C11V24">&nbsp;</a>In time of security he will come even on the fattest places of the province; and he will do that which
his fathers have not done, nor his fathers’ fathers; he will scatter among them prey, and plunder, and
substance. Yes, he will devise his devices against the strongholds, even for a time.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C11V25">&nbsp;</a>“He will stir up his power and his courage against the king of the south with a great army; and the king
of the south will wage war in battle with an exceeding great and mighty army; but he won’t stand; for
they will devise devices against him.
 <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C11V26">&nbsp;</a>Yes, they who eat of his dainties will destroy him, and his army will be swept away. Many will fall down
slain.
 <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C11V27">&nbsp;</a>As for both these kings, their hearts will be to do mischief, and they will speak lies at one table;
but it won’t prosper, for the end will still be at the time appointed.
 <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C11V28">&nbsp;</a>Then he will return into his land with great substance; and his heart will be against the holy covenant;
and he will take action, and return to his own land.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C11V29">&nbsp;</a>“He will return at the appointed time, and come into the south; but it won’t be in the latter time as
it was in the former.
 <span class="verse"> 30</span><a name="C11V30">&nbsp;</a>For ships of Kittim will come against him; therefore he will be grieved, and will return, and have indignation
against the holy covenant, and will take action. He will even return, and have regard to those who forsake
the holy covenant.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 31</span><a name="C11V31">&nbsp;</a>“Forces will stand on his part, and they will profane the sanctuary, even the fortress, and will take
away the continual burnt offering, and they will set up the abomination that makes desolate.
 <span class="verse"> 32</span><a name="C11V32">&nbsp;</a>He will pervent those who do wickedly against the covenant by flatteries; but the people who know their
God will be strong, and take action.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 33</span><a name="C11V33">&nbsp;</a>“Those who are wise among the people will instruct many; yet they will fall by the sword and by flame,
by captivity and by plunder, many days.
 <span class="verse"> 34</span><a name="C11V34">&nbsp;</a>Now when they fall, they will be helped with a little help; but many will join themselves to them with
flatteries.
 <span class="verse"> 35</span><a name="C11V35">&nbsp;</a>Some of those who are wise will fall, to refine them, and to purify, and to make them white, even to
the time of the end; because it is yet for the time appointed.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 36</span><a name="C11V36">&nbsp;</a>“The king will do according to his will; and he will exalt himself, and magnify himself above every god,
and will speak marvelous things against the God of gods; and he will prosper until the indignation is
accomplished; for that which is determined will be done.
 <span class="verse"> 37</span><a name="C11V37">&nbsp;</a>Neither will he regard the gods of his fathers, nor the desire of women, nor regard any god; for he will
magnify himself above all.
 <span class="verse"> 38</span><a name="C11V38">&nbsp;</a>But in his place he will honor the god of fortresses. He will honor a god whom his fathers didn’t know
with gold, and silver, and with precious stones, and pleasant things.
 <span class="verse"> 39</span><a name="C11V39">&nbsp;</a>He will deal with the strongest fortresses by the help of a foreign god. He will increase with glory
whoever acknowledges him; and he will cause them to rule over many, and will divide the land for a price.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 40</span><a name="C11V40">&nbsp;</a>“At the time of the end the king of the south will contend with him; and the king of the north will come
against him like a whirlwind, with chariots, and with horsemen, and with many ships; and he will enter
into the countries, and will overflow and pass through.
 <span class="verse"> 41</span><a name="C11V41">&nbsp;</a>He will enter also into the glorious land, and many countries will be overthrown; but these will be delivered
out of his hand: Edom, and Moab, and the chief of the children of Ammon.
 <span class="verse"> 42</span><a name="C11V42">&nbsp;</a>He will stretch out his hand also on the countries; and the land of Egypt won’t escape.
 <span class="verse"> 43</span><a name="C11V43">&nbsp;</a>But he will have power over the treasures of gold and of silver, and over all the precious things of
Egypt; and the Libyans and the Ethiopians will be at his steps.
 <span class="verse"> 44</span><a name="C11V44">&nbsp;</a>But news out of the east and out of the north will trouble him; and he will go out with great fury to
destroy and utterly to sweep away many.
 <span class="verse"> 45</span><a name="C11V45">&nbsp;</a>He will plant the tents of his palace between the sea and the glorious holy mountain; yet he will come
to his end, and no one will help him.
