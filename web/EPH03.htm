 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C3V1">&nbsp;</a>For this cause I, Paul, am the prisoner of Christ Jesus on behalf of you Gentiles,
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C3V2">&nbsp;</a>if it is so that you have heard of the administration of that grace of God which was given me toward
you;
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C3V3">&nbsp;</a>how that by revelation the mystery was made known to me, as I wrote before in few words,
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C3V4">&nbsp;</a>by which, when you read, you can perceive my understanding in the mystery of Christ;
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C3V5">&nbsp;</a>which in other generations was not made known to the children of men, as it has now been revealed to
his holy apostles and prophets in the Spirit;
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C3V6">&nbsp;</a>that the Gentiles are fellow heirs, and fellow members of the body, and fellow partakers of his promise
in Christ Jesus through the Good News,
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C3V7">&nbsp;</a>of which I was made a servant, according to the gift of that grace of God which was given me according
to the working of his power.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C3V8">&nbsp;</a>To me, the very least of all saints, was this grace given, to preach to the Gentiles the unsearchable
riches of Christ,
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C3V9">&nbsp;</a>and to make all men see what is the administration<a href="#FN1"><span class="notemark">*</span><span class="popup">TR reads “fellowship” instead of “administration”</span></a>
 of the mystery which for ages has been hidden in God, who created all things through Jesus Christ;
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C3V10">&nbsp;</a>to the intent that now through the assembly the manifold wisdom of God might be made known to the principalities
and the powers in the heavenly places,
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C3V11">&nbsp;</a>according to the eternal purpose which he purposed in Christ Jesus our Lord;
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C3V12">&nbsp;</a>in whom we have boldness and access in confidence through our faith in him.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C3V13">&nbsp;</a>Therefore I ask that you may not lose heart at my troubles for you, which are your glory.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C3V14">&nbsp;</a>For this cause, I bow my knees to the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C3V15">&nbsp;</a>from whom every family in heaven and on earth is named,
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C3V16">&nbsp;</a>that he would grant you, according to the riches of his glory, that you may be strengthened with power
through his Spirit in the inward man;
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C3V17">&nbsp;</a>that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith; to the end that you, being rooted and grounded in
love,
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C3V18">&nbsp;</a>may be strengthened to comprehend with all the saints what is the width and length and height and depth,
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C3V19">&nbsp;</a>and to know Christ’s love which surpasses knowledge, that you may be filled with all the fullness of
God.
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C3V20">&nbsp;</a>Now to him who is able to do exceedingly abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the
power that works in us,
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C3V21">&nbsp;</a>to him be the glory in the assembly and in Christ Jesus to all generations forever and ever. Amen.
