 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C7V1">&nbsp;</a>When I would heal Israel,
</div>
<div class="q2">then the iniquity of Ephraim is uncovered,
</div>
<div class="q2">also the wickedness of Samaria;
</div>
<div class="q2">for they commit falsehood,
</div>
<div class="q2">and the thief enters in,
</div>
<div class="q2">and the gang of robbers ravages outside.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C7V2">&nbsp;</a>They don’t consider in their hearts that I remember all their wickedness.
</div>
<div class="q2">Now their own deeds have engulfed them.
</div>
<div class="q2">They are before my face.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C7V3">&nbsp;</a>They make the king glad with their wickedness,
</div>
<div class="q2">and the princes with their lies.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C7V4">&nbsp;</a>They are all adulterers.
</div>
<div class="q2">They are burning like an oven that the baker stops stirring,
</div>
<div class="q2">from the kneading of the dough, until it is leavened.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C7V5">&nbsp;</a>On the day of our king, the princes made themselves sick with the heat of wine.
</div>
<div class="q2">He joined his hand with mockers.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C7V6">&nbsp;</a>For they have prepared their heart like an oven,
</div>
<div class="q2">while they lie in wait.
</div>
<div class="q2">Their baker sleeps all the night.
</div>
<div class="q2">In the morning it burns as a flaming fire.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C7V7">&nbsp;</a>They are all hot as an oven,
</div>
<div class="q2">and devour their judges.
</div>
<div class="q1">All their kings have fallen.
</div>
<div class="q2">There is no one among them who calls to me.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C7V8">&nbsp;</a>Ephraim, he mixes himself among the nations.
</div>
<div class="q2">Ephraim is a pancake not turned over.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C7V9">&nbsp;</a>Strangers have devoured his strength,
</div>
<div class="q2">and he doesn’t realize it.
</div>
<div class="q1">Indeed, gray hairs are here and there on him,
</div>
<div class="q2">and he doesn’t realize it.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C7V10">&nbsp;</a>The pride of Israel testifies to his face;
</div>
<div class="q2">yet they haven’t returned to Yahweh their God,
</div>
<div class="q2">nor sought him, for all this.
</div>
<div class="b"></div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C7V11">&nbsp;</a>“Ephraim is like an easily deceived dove, without understanding.
</div>
<div class="q2">They call to Egypt.
</div>
<div class="q2">They go to Assyria.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C7V12">&nbsp;</a>When they go, I will spread my net on them.
</div>
<div class="q2">I will bring them down like the birds of the sky.
</div>
<div class="q2">I will chastise them, as their congregation has heard.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C7V13">&nbsp;</a>Woe to them!
</div>
<div class="q2">For they have wandered from me.
</div>
<div class="q1">Destruction to them!
</div>
<div class="q2">For they have trespassed against me.
</div>
<div class="q1">Though I would redeem them,
</div>
<div class="q2">yet they have spoken lies against me.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C7V14">&nbsp;</a>They haven’t cried to me with their heart,
</div>
<div class="q2">but they howl on their beds.
</div>
<div class="q1">They assemble themselves for grain and new wine.
</div>
<div class="q2">They turn away from me.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C7V15">&nbsp;</a>Though I have taught and strengthened their arms,
</div>
<div class="q2">yet they plot evil against me.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C7V16">&nbsp;</a>They return, but not to the Most High.
</div>
<div class="q2">They are like a faulty bow.
</div>
<div class="q2">Their princes will fall by the sword for the rage of their tongue.
</div>
<div class="q2">This will be their derision in the land of Egypt.
