 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C13V1">&nbsp;</a>As he went out of the temple, one of his disciples said to him, “Teacher, see what kind of stones and
what kind of buildings!”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C13V2">&nbsp;</a>Jesus said to him,
<span class="wj">“Do you see these great buildings? There will not be left here one stone on another, which will not be
thrown down.”</span></div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C13V3">&nbsp;</a>As he sat on the Mount of Olives opposite the temple, Peter, James, John, and Andrew asked him privately,
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C13V4">&nbsp;</a>“Tell us, when will these things be? What is the sign that these things are all about to be fulfilled?”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C13V5">&nbsp;</a>Jesus, answering, began to tell them,
<span class="wj">“Be careful that no one leads you astray.
</span> <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C13V6">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">For many will come in my name, saying, ‘I am he!’</span><a href="#FN1"><span class="notemark">*</span><span class="popup">or, “I AM!”</span></a>
<span class="wj">and will lead many astray.</span></div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C13V7">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">“When you hear of wars and rumors of wars, don’t be troubled. For those must happen, but the end is not
yet.
</span> <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C13V8">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be earthquakes in various
places. There will be famines and troubles. These things are the beginning of birth pains.
</span> <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C13V9">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">But watch yourselves, for they will deliver you up to councils. You will be beaten in synagogues. You
will stand before rulers and kings for my sake, for a testimony to them.
</span> <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C13V10">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">The Good News must first be preached to all the nations.
</span> <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C13V11">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">When they lead you away and deliver you up, don’t be anxious beforehand, or premeditate what you will
say, but say whatever will be given you in that hour. For it is not you who speak, but the Holy Spirit.</span></div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C13V12">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">“Brother will deliver up brother to death, and the father his child. Children will rise up against parents,

<span class="wj">spoken of by Daniel the prophet, standing where it ought not (let the reader understand), then let those
who are in Judea flee to the mountains,

</span> <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C13V19">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">For in those days there will be oppression, such as there has not been the like from the beginning of
the creation which God created until now, and never will be.

ones, whom he picked out, he shortened the days.

lead astray, if possible, even the chosen ones.

you know that the summer is near;
</span> <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C13V29">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">even so you also, when you see these things coming to pass, know that it is near, at the doors.
