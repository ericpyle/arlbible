 the hundred and sixties year Alexander Epiphanes, the son of Antiochus, went up and took possession
of Ptolemais: and they received him, and he reigned there.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C10V2">&nbsp;</a>And king Demetrius heard thereof, and he gathered together exceeding great forces, and went forth to
meet him in battle.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C10V3">&nbsp;</a>And Demetrius sent letters to Jonathan with words of peace, so as to magnify him.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C10V4">&nbsp;</a>For he said, let us be beforehand to make peace with them, ere he make peace with Alexander against us:
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C10V5">&nbsp;</a>for he will remember all the evils that we have done against him, and to his brethren and to his nation.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C10V6">&nbsp;</a>And he gave him authority to gather together forces, and to provide arms, and that he should be his confederate:
and he commanded that they should deliver up to him the hostages that were in the citadel.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C10V7">&nbsp;</a>And Jonathan came to Jerusalem, and read the letters in the audience of all the people, and of them that
were in the citadel:
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C10V8">&nbsp;</a>and they were sore afraid, when they heard that the king had given him authority to gather together a
host.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C10V9">&nbsp;</a>And they of the citadel delivered up the hostages to Jonathan, and he restored them to their parents.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C10V10">&nbsp;</a>And Jonathan lived in Jerusalem, and began to build and renew the city.

 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C10V12">&nbsp;</a>And the strangers, that were in the strongholds which Bacchides had built, fled away;
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C10V13">&nbsp;</a>and each man left his place, and departed into his own land.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C10V14">&nbsp;</a>Only at Bethsura were there left certain of those that had forsaken the law and the commandments; for
it was a place of refuge to them.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C10V15">&nbsp;</a>And king Alexander heard all the promises which Demetrius had sent to Jonathan: and they told him of
the battles and the valiant deeds which he and his brethren had done, and of the toils which they had
endured;

with us.

arms in abundance.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C10V22">&nbsp;</a>And Demetrius heard these things, and he was grieved, and said,
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C10V23">&nbsp;</a>What is this that we have done, that Alexander has been beforehand with us in establishing friendship
with the Jews, to strengthen himself?
 <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C10V24">&nbsp;</a>I also will write to them words of encouragement and of honor and of gifts, that they may be with me
to aid me.
 <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C10V25">&nbsp;</a>And he sent to them according to these words:
</div>
<div class="p">King Demetrius to the nation of the Jews, greeting:
 <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C10V26">&nbsp;</a>Forasmuch as you⌃ have kept your covenants with us, and continued in our friendship, and have not joined
yourselves to our enemies, we have heard hereof, and are glad.
 <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C10V27">&nbsp;</a>And now continue you⌃ still to keep faith with us, and we will recompense to you good things in return
for your dealings with us,
 <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C10V28">&nbsp;</a>and will grant you many immunities, and give you gifts.
 <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C10V29">&nbsp;</a>And now do I free you, and release all the Jews, from the tributes, and from the customs of salt, and
from the crowns.
 <span class="verse"> 30</span><a name="C10V30">&nbsp;</a>And instead of the third part of the seed, and instead of the half of the fruit of the trees, which falls
to me to receive, I release it from this day and henceforth, so that I will not take it from the land
of Judah, and from the three governments which are added thereto from the country of Samaria and Galilee,
from this day forth and for all time.
 <span class="verse"> 31</span><a name="C10V31">&nbsp;</a>And let Jerusalem be holy and free, and her borders; the tenths and the tolls
<span class="add">also.
</span> <span class="verse"> 32</span><a name="C10V32">&nbsp;</a>I yield up also my authority over the citadel which is at Jerusalem, and give it to the high priest,
that he may appoint in it such men as he shall choose to keep it.
 <span class="verse"> 33</span><a name="C10V33">&nbsp;</a>And every soul of the Jews, that has been carried captive from the land of Judah into any part of my
kingdom, I set at liberty without price; and let all remit the tributes of their cattle also.
 <span class="verse"> 34</span><a name="C10V34">&nbsp;</a>And all the feasts, and the Sabbaths, and new moons, and appointed days, and three days before a feast,
and three days after a feast, let them all be days of immunity and release for all the Jews that are
in my kingdom.
 <span class="verse"> 35</span><a name="C10V35">&nbsp;</a>And no man shall have authority to exact from any of them, or to trouble them concerning any matter.
 <span class="verse"> 36</span><a name="C10V36">&nbsp;</a>And let there be enrolled among the king’s forces about thirty thousand men of the Jews, and pay shall
be given to them, as belongs to all the king’s forces.
 <span class="verse"> 37</span><a name="C10V37">&nbsp;</a>And of them some shall be placed in the king’s great strongholds, and some of them shall be placed over
the affairs of the kingdom, which are of trust: and let those that are over them, and their rulers, be
of themselves, and let them walk after their own laws, even as the king has commanded in the land of
Judah.
 <span class="verse"> 38</span><a name="C10V38">&nbsp;</a>And the three governments that have been added to Judaea from the country of Samaria, let them be added
to Judaea, that they may be reckoned to be under one, that they may not obey other authority than the
high priest’s.
 <span class="verse"> 39</span><a name="C10V39">&nbsp;</a>As for Ptolemais, and the land pertaining thereto, I have given it as a gift to the sanctuary that is
at Jerusalem, for the expenses that befit the sanctuary.
 <span class="verse"> 40</span><a name="C10V40">&nbsp;</a>And I give every year fifteen thousand shekels of silver from the king’s revenues from the places that
are convenient.
 <span class="verse"> 41</span><a name="C10V41">&nbsp;</a>And all the overplus, which they that manage the king’s affairs paid not in as in the first years, they
shall give from henceforth toward the works of the house.
 <span class="verse"> 42</span><a name="C10V42">&nbsp;</a>And beside this, the five thousand shekels of silver, which they received from the uses of the sanctuary
from the revenue year by year, this also is released, because it appertains to the priests that minister.
 <span class="verse"> 43</span><a name="C10V43">&nbsp;</a>And whoever shall flee to the temple that is at Jerusalem, and
<span class="add">be found
</span> within all the borders thereof, whether one owe moneys to the king, or any other matter, let them go
free, and all that they have in my kingdom.
 <span class="verse"> 44</span><a name="C10V44">&nbsp;</a>And for the building and renewing of the works of the sanctuary the expense shall be given also out of
the king’s revenue.
 <span class="verse"> 45</span><a name="C10V45">&nbsp;</a>And for the building of the walls of Jerusalem, and the fortifying thereof round about, shall the expense
be given also out of the king’s revenue, and for the building of the walls in Judaea.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 46</span><a name="C10V46">&nbsp;</a>Now when Jonathan and the people heard these words, they gave no credence to them, nor received them,
because they remembered the great evil which he had done in Israel, and that he had afflicted them very
sore.
 <span class="verse"> 47</span><a name="C10V47">&nbsp;</a>And they were well pleased with Alexander, because he was the first that spoke words of peace to them,
and they were confederate with him always.
 <span class="verse"> 48</span><a name="C10V48">&nbsp;</a>And king Alexander gathered together great forces, and encamped over against Demetrius.
 <span class="verse"> 49</span><a name="C10V49">&nbsp;</a>And the two kings joined battle, and the army of Alexander fled; and Demetrius followed after him, and
prevailed against them.
 <span class="verse"> 50</span><a name="C10V50">&nbsp;</a>And he strengthened the battle exceedingly until the sun went down: and Demetrius fell that day.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 51</span><a name="C10V51">&nbsp;</a>And Alexander sent ambassadors to Ptolemy king of Egypt according to these words, saying,
 <span class="verse"> 52</span><a name="C10V52">&nbsp;</a>Forasmuch as I am returned to my kingdom, and am set on the throne of my fathers, and have gotten the
dominion, and have overthrown Demetrius, and have gotten possession of our country;
 <span class="verse"> 53</span><a name="C10V53">&nbsp;</a>yes, I joined the battle with him, and he and his army were discomfited by us, and we sat upon the throne
of his kingdom:
 <span class="verse"> 54</span><a name="C10V54">&nbsp;</a>now also let us establish amity one with the other, and give me now your daughter to wife: and I will
make affinity with you, and will give both you and her gifts worthy of you.
 <span class="verse"> 55</span><a name="C10V55">&nbsp;</a>And Ptolemy the king answered, saying, Happy is the day wherein you did return into the land of your
fathers, and did sit on the throne of their kingdom.
 <span class="verse"> 56</span><a name="C10V56">&nbsp;</a>And now will I do to you, as you have written: but meet me at Ptolemais, that we may see one another;
and I will make affinity with you, even as you have said.
 <span class="verse"> 57</span><a name="C10V57">&nbsp;</a>And Ptolemy went out of Egypt, himself and Cleopatra his daughter, and came to Ptolemais in
<a href="#FN7"><span class="notemark">‡‡</span><span class="popup">circa B.C 151.
</span></a>
 the hundred and threescore and second year:
 <span class="verse"> 58</span><a name="C10V58">&nbsp;</a>and king Alexander met him, and he bestowed on him his daughter Cleopatra, and celebrated her marriage
at Ptolemais with great pomp, as the manner of kings is.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 59</span><a name="C10V59">&nbsp;</a>And king Alexander wrote to Jonathan, that he should come to meet him.
 <span class="verse"> 60</span><a name="C10V60">&nbsp;</a>And he went with pomp to Ptolemais, and met the two kings, and gave them and their
<a href="#FN8"><span class="notemark">§§</span><span class="popup">See 1 Maccabees 2:18. Compare 1 Maccabees 10:65.
</span></a>
 Friends silver and gold, and many gifts, and found favor in their sight.
 <span class="verse"> 61</span><a name="C10V61">&nbsp;</a>And there were gathered together against him certain pestilent fellows out of Israel, men that were transgressors
of the law, to complain against him: and the king gave no heed to them.
 <span class="verse"> 62</span><a name="C10V62">&nbsp;</a>And the king commanded, and they took off Jonathan’s garments, and clothed him in purple: and thus they
did.
 <span class="verse"> 63</span><a name="C10V63">&nbsp;</a>And the king made him sit with him, and said to his princes, Go forth with him into the midst of the
city, and make proclamation, that no man complain against him of any matter, and let no man trouble him
for any manner of cause.
 <span class="verse"> 64</span><a name="C10V64">&nbsp;</a>And it came to pass, when they that complained against him saw his glory according as
<span class="add">the herald
</span> made proclamation, and
<span class="add">saw
</span> him clothed in purple, they all fled away.
 <span class="verse"> 65</span><a name="C10V65">&nbsp;</a>And the king gave him honor, and wrote him among his
<a href="#FN9"><span class="notemark">***</span><span class="popup">See 1 Maccabees 11:27; 2 Maccabees 8:9. Compare 1 Maccabees 2:18; 10:16, etc.
</span></a>
 Chief Friends, and made him a captain, and governor of a province.
 <span class="verse"> 66</span><a name="C10V66">&nbsp;</a>And Jonathan returned to Jerusalem with peace and gladness.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 67</span><a name="C10V67">&nbsp;</a>And in
<a href="#FN10"><span class="notemark">†††</span><span class="popup">circa B.C 148.
</span></a>
 the hundred and threescore and fifth year came Demetrius, son of Demetrius, out of Crete into the land
of his fathers:
 <span class="verse"> 68</span><a name="C10V68">&nbsp;</a>and king Alexander heard thereof, and he grieved exceedingly, and returned to Antioch.
 <span class="verse"> 69</span><a name="C10V69">&nbsp;</a>And Demetrius appointed Apollonius, who was over Coelesyria, and he gathered together a great host, and
encamped in Jamnia, and sent to Jonathan the high priest, saying,
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 70</span><a name="C10V70">&nbsp;</a>You alone lift up yourself against us, but I am had in derision and in reproach because of you. And why
do you vaunt your power against us in the mountains?
 <span class="verse"> 71</span><a name="C10V71">&nbsp;</a>Now therefore, if you trust in your forces, come down to us into the plain, and there let us try the
matter together; for with me is the power of the cities.
 <span class="verse"> 72</span><a name="C10V72">&nbsp;</a>Ask and learn who I am, and the rest that help us; and they say, Your foot can’t stand before our face;
for your fathers have been twice put to flight in their own land.
 <span class="verse"> 73</span><a name="C10V73">&nbsp;</a>And now you shall not be able to abide the horse and such a host as this in the plain, where is neither
stone nor flint, nor place to flee to.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 74</span><a name="C10V74">&nbsp;</a>Now when Jonathan heard the words of Apollonius, he was moved in his mind, and he chose out ten thousand
men, and went forth from Jerusalem, and Simon his brother met him for to help him.
 <span class="verse"> 75</span><a name="C10V75">&nbsp;</a>And he encamped against Joppa: and they of the city shut him out, because Apollonius had a garrison in
Joppa:
 <span class="verse"> 76</span><a name="C10V76">&nbsp;</a>and they fought against it. And they of the city were afraid, and opened to him: and Jonathan became
master of Joppa.
 <span class="verse"> 77</span><a name="C10V77">&nbsp;</a>And Apollonius heard, and he gathered an army of three thousand horse, and a great host, and went to
Azotus as though he were on a journey, and therewithal drew onward into the plain, because he had a multitude
of horse, and trusted therein.
 <span class="verse"> 78</span><a name="C10V78">&nbsp;</a>And he pursued after him to Azotus, and the armies joined battle<a href="#FN11"><span class="notemark">‡‡‡</span><span class="popup">Most of the authorities here repeat
after him.</span></a>
.
 <span class="verse"> 79</span><a name="C10V79">&nbsp;</a>And Apollonius had left a thousand horse behind them privily.
 <span class="verse"> 80</span><a name="C10V80">&nbsp;</a>And Jonathan knew that there was an ambushment behind him. And they compassed round his army, and cast
their darts at the people, from morning until evening:
 <span class="verse"> 81</span><a name="C10V81">&nbsp;</a>but the people stood still, as Jonathan commanded them: and their horses were wearied.
 <span class="verse"> 82</span><a name="C10V82">&nbsp;</a>And Simon drew forth his host, and joined battle with the phalanx (for the horsemen were spent), and
they were discomfited by him, and fled.
 <span class="verse"> 83</span><a name="C10V83">&nbsp;</a>And the horsemen were scattered in the plain, and they fled to Azotus, and entered into Beth-dagon, their
idol’s temple, to save themselves.
 <span class="verse"> 84</span><a name="C10V84">&nbsp;</a>And Jonathan burned Azotus, and the cities round about it, and took their spoils; and the temple of Dagon,
and them that fled into it, he burned with fire.
 <span class="verse"> 85</span><a name="C10V85">&nbsp;</a>And they that had fallen by the sword, with them that were burned, were about eight thousand men.
 <span class="verse"> 86</span><a name="C10V86">&nbsp;</a>And from thence Jonathan removed, and encamped against Ascalon, and they of the city came forth to meet
him with great pomp.
 <span class="verse"> 87</span><a name="C10V87">&nbsp;</a>And Jonathan, with them that were on his side, returned to Jerusalem, having many spoils.
 <span class="verse"> 88</span><a name="C10V88">&nbsp;</a>And it came to pass, when king Alexander heard these things, he honored Jonathan yet more;
 <span class="verse"> 89</span><a name="C10V89">&nbsp;</a>and he sent to him a buckle of gold, as the use is to give to such as are of the kindred of the kings:
and he gave him Ekron and all the coasts thereof for a possession.
