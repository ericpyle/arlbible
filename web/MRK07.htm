 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C7V1">&nbsp;</a>Then the Pharisees and some of the scribes gathered together to him, having come from Jerusalem.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C7V2">&nbsp;</a>Now when they saw some of his disciples eating bread with defiled, that is unwashed, hands, they found
fault.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C7V3">&nbsp;</a>(For the Pharisees and all the Jews, don’t eat unless they wash their hands and forearms, holding to
the tradition of the elders.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C7V4">&nbsp;</a>They don’t eat when they come from the marketplace unless they bathe themselves, and there are many other
things, which they have received to hold to: washings of cups, pitchers, bronze vessels, and couches.)
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C7V5">&nbsp;</a>The Pharisees and the scribes asked him, “Why don’t your disciples walk according to the tradition of
the elders, but eat their bread with unwashed hands?”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C7V6">&nbsp;</a>He answered them,
<span class="wj">“Well did Isaiah prophesy of you hypocrites, as it is written,</span></div>
<div class="q1"><span class="wj">‘This people honors me with their lips,</span></div>
<div class="q2"><span class="wj">but their heart is far from me.</span></div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C7V7">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">But they worship me in vain,</span></div>
<div class="q2"><span class="wj">teaching as doctrines the commandments of men.’</span><a href="#FN1"><span class="notemark"></span><span class="popup">+ Isaiah 29:13
</span></a>
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C7V8">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">“For you set aside the commandment of God, and hold tightly to the tradition of men—the washing of pitchers
and cups, and you do many other such things.”</span> <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C7V9">&nbsp;</a>He said to them,
<span class="wj">“Full well do you reject the commandment of God, that you may keep your tradition.
</span> <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C7V10">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">For Moses said, ‘Honor your father and your mother;’</span><a href="#FN2"><span class="notemark"></span><span class="popup">+ Exodus 20:12; Deuteronomy 5:16</span></a>
<span class="wj">and, ‘He who speaks evil of father or mother, let him be put to death.’</span><a href="#FN3"><span class="notemark"></span><span class="popup">+ Exodus 21:17; Leviticus 20:9</span></a>
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C7V11">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">But you say, ‘If a man tells his father or his mother, “Whatever profit you might have received from
me is Corban,</span><a href="#FN4"><span class="notemark">*</span><span class="popup">Corban is a Hebrew word for an offering devoted to God.</span></a>
<span class="wj"> that is to say, given to God”;’
</span> <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C7V12">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">then you no longer allow him to do anything for his father or his mother,
</span> <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C7V13">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">making void the word of God by your tradition, which you have handed down. You do many things like this.”</span></div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C7V14">&nbsp;</a>He called all the multitude to himself, and said to them,
<span class="wj">“Hear me, all of you, and understand.
</span> <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C7V15">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">There is nothing from outside of the man, that going into him can defile him; but the things which proceed
out of the man are those that defile the man.

</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C7V17">&nbsp;</a>When he had entered into a house away from the multitude, his disciples asked him about the parable.
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C7V18">&nbsp;</a>He said to them,
<span class="wj">“Are you also without understanding? Don’t you perceive that whatever goes into the man from outside
can’t defile him,
</span> <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C7V19">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">because it doesn’t go into his heart, but into his stomach, then into the latrine, thus purifying all
foods</span><a href="#FN6"><span class="notemark">‡</span><span class="popup">or, “making all foods clean”. NU ends Jesus’ direct quote and question after “latrine”, ending the verse
with “Thus he declared all foods clean.
</span></a>
<span class="wj">?”
</span> <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C7V20">&nbsp;</a>He said,
<span class="wj">“That which proceeds out of the man, that defiles the man.
</span> <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C7V21">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">For from within, out of the hearts of men, proceed evil thoughts, adulteries, sexual sins, murders, thefts,
</span> <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C7V22">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">covetings, wickedness, deceit, lustful desires, an evil eye, blasphemy, pride, and foolishness.
</span> <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C7V23">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">All these evil things come from within, and defile the man.”
</span></div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C7V24">&nbsp;</a>From there he arose, and went away into the borders of Tyre and Sidon. He entered into a house, and didn’t
want anyone to know it, but he couldn’t escape notice.
 <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C7V25">&nbsp;</a>For a woman, whose little daughter had an unclean spirit, having heard of him, came and fell down at
his feet.
 <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C7V26">&nbsp;</a>Now the woman was a Greek, a Syrophoenician by race. She begged him that he would cast the demon out
of her daughter.
 <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C7V27">&nbsp;</a>But Jesus said to her,
<span class="wj">“Let the children be filled first, for it is not appropriate to take the children’s bread and throw it
to the dogs.”
</span></div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C7V28">&nbsp;</a>But she answered him, “Yes, Lord. Yet even the dogs under the table eat the children’s crumbs.”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C7V29">&nbsp;</a>He said to her,
<span class="wj">“For this saying, go your way. The demon has gone out of your daughter.”</span></div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 30</span><a name="C7V30">&nbsp;</a>She went away to her house, and found the child having been laid on the bed, with the demon gone out.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 31</span><a name="C7V31">&nbsp;</a>Again he departed from the borders of Tyre and Sidon, and came to the sea of Galilee, through the middle
of the region of Decapolis.
 <span class="verse"> 32</span><a name="C7V32">&nbsp;</a>They brought to him one who was deaf and had an impediment in his speech. They begged him to lay his
hand on him.
 <span class="verse"> 33</span><a name="C7V33">&nbsp;</a>He took him aside from the multitude, privately, and put his fingers into his ears, and he spat, and
touched his tongue.
 <span class="verse"> 34</span><a name="C7V34">&nbsp;</a>Looking up to heaven, he sighed, and said to him,
<span class="wj">“Ephphatha!”
</span> that is,
<span class="wj">“Be opened!”</span> <span class="verse"> 35</span><a name="C7V35">&nbsp;</a>Immediately his ears were opened, and the impediment of his tongue was released, and he spoke clearly.
 <span class="verse"> 36</span><a name="C7V36">&nbsp;</a>He commanded them that they should tell no one, but the more he commanded them, so much the more widely
they proclaimed it.
 <span class="verse"> 37</span><a name="C7V37">&nbsp;</a>They were astonished beyond measure, saying, “He has done all things well. He makes even the deaf hear,
and the mute speak!”
