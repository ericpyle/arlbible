 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C5V1">&nbsp;</a>Stand firm therefore in the liberty by which Christ has made us free, and don’t be entangled again with
a yoke of bondage.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C5V2">&nbsp;</a>Behold, I, Paul, tell you that if you receive circumcision, Christ will profit you nothing.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C5V3">&nbsp;</a>Yes, I testify again to every man who receives circumcision, that he is a debtor to do the whole law.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C5V4">&nbsp;</a>You are alienated from Christ, you who desire to be justified by the law. You have fallen away from grace.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C5V5">&nbsp;</a>For we, through the Spirit, by faith wait for the hope of righteousness.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C5V6">&nbsp;</a>For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision amounts to anything, nor uncircumcision, but faith working through
love.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C5V7">&nbsp;</a>You were running well! Who interfered with you that you should not obey the truth?
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C5V8">&nbsp;</a>This persuasion is not from him who calls you.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C5V9">&nbsp;</a>A little yeast grows through the whole lump.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C5V10">&nbsp;</a>I have confidence toward you in the Lord that you will think no other way. But he who troubles you will
bear his judgment, whoever he is.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C5V11">&nbsp;</a>But I, brothers, if I still preach circumcision, why am I still persecuted? Then the stumbling block
of the cross has been removed.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C5V12">&nbsp;</a>I wish that those who disturb you would cut themselves off.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C5V13">&nbsp;</a>For you, brothers, were called for freedom. Only don’t use your freedom for gain to the flesh, but through
love be servants to one another.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C5V14">&nbsp;</a>For the whole law is fulfilled in one word, in this: “You shall love your neighbor as yourself.”<a href="#FN1"><span class="notemark"></span><span class="popup">+ Leviticus 19:18</span></a>
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C5V15">&nbsp;</a>But if you bite and devour one another, be careful that you don’t consume one another.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C5V16">&nbsp;</a>But I say, walk by the Spirit, and you won’t fulfill the lust of the flesh.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C5V17">&nbsp;</a>For the flesh lusts against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh; and these are contrary to one
another, that you may not do the things that you desire.
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C5V18">&nbsp;</a>But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the law.
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C5V19">&nbsp;</a>Now the deeds of the flesh are obvious, which are: adultery, sexual immorality, uncleanness, lustfulness,
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C5V20">&nbsp;</a>idolatry, sorcery, hatred, strife, jealousies, outbursts of anger, rivalries, divisions, heresies,
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C5V21">&nbsp;</a>envy, murders, drunkenness, orgies, and things like these; of which I forewarn you, even as I also forewarned
you, that those who practice such things will not inherit God’s Kingdom.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C5V22">&nbsp;</a>But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faith,<a href="#FN2"><span class="notemark">*</span><span class="popup">or, faithfulness</span></a>
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C5V23">&nbsp;</a>gentleness, and self-control. Against such things there is no law.
 <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C5V24">&nbsp;</a>Those who belong to Christ have crucified the flesh with its passions and lusts.
 <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C5V25">&nbsp;</a>If we live by the Spirit, let’s also walk by the Spirit.
 <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C5V26">&nbsp;</a>Let’s not become conceited, provoking one another, and envying one another.
