 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C34V1">&nbsp;</a>Yahweh’s word came to me, saying,
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C34V2">&nbsp;</a>“Son of man, prophesy against the shepherds of Israel. Prophesy, and tell them, even to the shepherds,
‘Thus says the Lord Yahweh: “Woe to the shepherds of Israel who feed themselves! Shouldn’t the shepherds
feed the sheep?
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C34V3">&nbsp;</a>You eat the fat, and you clothe yourself with the wool, you kill the fatlings; but you don’t feed the
sheep.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C34V4">&nbsp;</a>You haven’t strengthened the diseased, neither have you healed that which was sick, neither have you
bound up that which was broken, neither have you brought back that which was driven away, neither have
you sought that which was lost; but with force and with rigor you have ruled over them.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C34V5">&nbsp;</a>They were scattered, because there was no shepherd; and they became food to all the animals of the field,
and were scattered.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C34V6">&nbsp;</a>My sheep wandered through all the mountains, and on every high hill. Yes, my sheep were scattered on
all the surface of the earth; and there was no one who searched or sought.”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C34V7">&nbsp;</a>“‘Therefore, you shepherds, hear Yahweh’s word:
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C34V8">&nbsp;</a>“As I live,” says the Lord Yahweh, “surely because my sheep became a prey, and my sheep became food to
all the animals of the field, because there was no shepherd, neither did my shepherds search for my sheep,
but the shepherds fed themselves, and didn’t feed my sheep;”
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C34V9">&nbsp;</a>therefore, you shepherds, hear Yahweh’s word.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C34V10">&nbsp;</a>Thus says the Lord Yahweh: “Behold, I am against the shepherds; and I will require my sheep at their
hand, and cause them to cease from feeding the sheep; neither will the shepherds feed themselves any
more; and I will deliver my sheep from their mouth, that they may not be food for them.”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C34V11">&nbsp;</a>“‘For thus says the Lord Yahweh: “Behold, I myself, even I, will search for my sheep, and will seek them
out.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C34V12">&nbsp;</a>As a shepherd seeks out his flock in the day that he is among his sheep that are scattered abroad, so
will I seek out my sheep; and I will deliver them out of all places where they have been scattered in
the cloudy and dark day.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C34V13">&nbsp;</a>I will bring them out from the peoples, and gather them from the countries, and will bring them into
their own land; and I will feed them on the mountains of Israel, by the watercourses, and in all the
inhabited places of the country.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C34V14">&nbsp;</a>I will feed them with good pasture; and their fold will be on the mountains of the height of Israel.
There they will lie down in a good fold. They will feed on fat pasture on the mountains of Israel.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C34V15">&nbsp;</a>I myself will be the shepherd of my sheep, and I will cause them to lie down,” says the Lord Yahweh.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C34V16">&nbsp;</a>“I will seek that which was lost, and will bring back that which was driven away, and will bind up that
which was broken, and will strengthen that which was sick; but the fat and the strong I will destroy.
I will feed them in justice.”’
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C34V17">&nbsp;</a>“As for you, O my flock, thus says the Lord Yahweh: ‘Behold, I judge between sheep and sheep, the rams
and the male goats.
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C34V18">&nbsp;</a>Does it seem a small thing to you to have fed on the good pasture, but you must tread down with your
feet the residue of your pasture? and to have drunk of the clear waters, but you must foul the residue
with your feet?
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C34V19">&nbsp;</a>As for my sheep, they eat that which you have trodden with your feet, and they drink that which you have
fouled with your feet.’
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C34V20">&nbsp;</a>“Therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh to them: ‘Behold, I, even I, will judge between the fat sheep and
the lean sheep.
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C34V21">&nbsp;</a>Because you thrust with side and with shoulder, and push all the diseased with your horns, until you
have scattered them abroad;
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C34V22">&nbsp;</a>therefore will I save my flock, and they will no more be a prey; and I will judge between sheep and sheep.
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C34V23">&nbsp;</a>I will set up one shepherd over them, and he will feed them, even my servant David. He will feed them,
and he will be their shepherd.
 <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C34V24">&nbsp;</a>I, Yahweh, will be their God, and my servant David prince among them; I, Yahweh, have spoken it.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C34V25">&nbsp;</a>“‘I will make with them a covenant of peace, and will cause evil animals to cease out of the land. They
will dwell securely in the wilderness, and sleep in the woods.
 <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C34V26">&nbsp;</a>I will make them and the places around my hill a blessing; and I will cause the shower to come down in
its season. There will be showers of blessing.
 <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C34V27">&nbsp;</a>The tree of the field will yield its fruit, and the earth will yield its increase, and they will be secure
in their land; and they will know that I am Yahweh, when I have broken the bars of their yoke, and have
delivered them out of the hand of those who made slaves of them.
 <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C34V28">&nbsp;</a>They will no more be a prey to the nations, neither will the animals of the earth devour them; but they
will dwell securely, and no one will make them afraid.
 <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C34V29">&nbsp;</a>I will raise up to them a plantation for renown, and they will no more be consumed with famine in the
land, neither bear the shame of the nations any more.
 <span class="verse"> 30</span><a name="C34V30">&nbsp;</a>They will know that I, Yahweh, their God am with them, and that they, the house of Israel, are my people,
says the Lord Yahweh.
 <span class="verse"> 31</span><a name="C34V31">&nbsp;</a>You my sheep, the sheep of my pasture, are men, and I am your God,’ says the Lord Yahweh.”
