 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C4V1">&nbsp;</a>And the angel that was sent to me, whose name was Uriel, gave me an answer,
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C4V2">&nbsp;</a>and said to me, your heart has utterly failed you in
<span class="add">regarding
</span> this world, and think you to comprehend the way of the Most High?
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C4V3">&nbsp;</a>Then said I, Yes my Lord.
</div>
<div class="p">And he answered me, and said, I am sent to show you three ways, and to set forth three similitudes before
you:
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C4V4">&nbsp;</a>whereof if you can declare me one, I also will show you the way that you desire to see, and I will teach
you wherefore the heart is

 wicked.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C4V5">&nbsp;</a>And I said, say on, my Lord.
</div>
<div class="p">Then said he to me, Go to, weigh me a weight of fire, or measure me a

 measure of wind, or call me again the day that is past.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C4V6">&nbsp;</a>Then answered I and said, who of the sons
<span class="add">of men
</span> is able to do this, that you should ask me of such things?
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C4V7">&nbsp;</a>And he said to me, If I had asked you, saying, How many dwellings are there in the heart of the sea?
or how many springs are there at the fountain head of the deep? or how many
<a href="#FN3"><span class="notemark">‡</span><span class="popup">After the Oriental versions.
</span></a>
 ways are above the firmament? or which are the outgoings
<a href="#FN4"><span class="notemark">§</span><span class="popup">So the Syriac. The Latin omits

</span></a>
 of hell? or which are the paths of paradise?
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C4V8">&nbsp;</a>perhaps you would say to me, I never went down into the deep, nor as yet into hell, neither did I ever
climb up into heaven.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C4V9">&nbsp;</a>Nevertheless now have I asked you but only of the fire and wind, and of the day, things wherethrough
you have passed, and
<a href="#FN5"><span class="notemark">**</span><span class="popup">Another reading is,
from which you can not be separated
</span></a>
 without which you can not be, and yet have you given me no answer of them.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C4V10">&nbsp;</a>He said moreover to me, Your own things, that are grown up with you, can you not know;
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C4V11">&nbsp;</a>how then can your vessel comprehend the way of the Most High? and how can he that is already worn out
with the corrupted world understand

</span></a>
 And when I heard these things I fell upon my face, and said to him, It were better that we were not
here at all, than that we should come here and live in the midst of ungodliness, and suffer, and not
know wherefore.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C4V13">&nbsp;</a>He answered me, and said,
<a href="#FN8"><span class="notemark">§§</span><span class="popup">So the Oriental versions. The Latin is corrupt. See Judges 9:8.
</span></a>
 The woods of the trees of the field went forth, and took counsel together,
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C4V14">&nbsp;</a>and said, Come, let us go and make war against the sea, that it may depart away before us, and that we
may make us more woods.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C4V15">&nbsp;</a>The waves of the sea also in like manner took counsel together, and said, Come, let us go up and subdue
the wood of the plain, that there also we may make us another country.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C4V16">&nbsp;</a>The counsel of the wood was in vain, for the fire came and consumed it:
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C4V17">&nbsp;</a>likewise also the counsel of the waves of the sea, for the sand stood up and stopped them.
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C4V18">&nbsp;</a>If you were judge now between these two, whom would you justify, or whom condemn?
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C4V19">&nbsp;</a>I answered and said, it is a foolish counsel that they both have taken, for the ground is given to the
wood, and the place of the sea
<span class="add">is given
</span> to bear his waves.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C4V20">&nbsp;</a>Then answered he me, and said, You have given a right judgement, and why judge you not in your own case?
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C4V21">&nbsp;</a>For like as the ground is given to the wood, and the sea to his waves, even so they that dwell upon the
earth may understand nothing but that which is upon the earth: and he
<span class="add">only that dwells
</span> above the heavens
<span class="add">may understand
</span> the things that are above the height of the heavens.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C4V22">&nbsp;</a>Then answered I and said, I beseech you, O Lord,
<a href="#FN9"><span class="notemark">***</span><span class="popup">After the Oriental versions.
</span></a>
 wherefore is the power of understanding given to me?
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C4V23">&nbsp;</a>For it was not in my mind to be curious of the ways above, but of such things as pass by us daily; because
Israel is given up as a reproach to the heathen,
<span class="add">and
</span> the people whom you have loved is given over to ungodly nations, and the law of our forefathers is made
of none effect, and the written covenants are nowhere
<span class="add">regarded,
</span> <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C4V24">&nbsp;</a>and we pass away out of the world as grasshoppers, and our life is as a

</span></a>
 vapor, neither are we worthy to obtain mercy.
 <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C4V25">&nbsp;</a>What will he then do for his name whereby we are called? Of these things have I asked.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C4V26">&nbsp;</a>Then he answered me, and said, if you be
<span class="add">alive
</span> you shall see, and if you live
<a href="#FN11"><span class="notemark">‡‡‡</span><span class="popup">So the Syriac.
</span></a>
 long, you shall marvel; for the world hastens fast to pass away.
 <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C4V27">&nbsp;</a>For it is not able to bear the things that are promised to the righteous in the times
<span class="add">to come:
</span> for this world is full of sadness and infirmities.
 <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C4V28">&nbsp;</a>For the evil
<a href="#FN12"><span class="notemark">§§§</span><span class="popup">so the Syriac and Aethiopic.
</span></a>
 whereof you asked me is sown, but the gathering thereof is not yet come.
 <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C4V29">&nbsp;</a>If therefore that which is sown be not reaped, and if the place where the evil is sown pass not away,
there can’t come the field where the good is sown.
 <span class="verse"> 30</span><a name="C4V30">&nbsp;</a>For a grain of evil seed was sown in the heart of Adam from the beginning, and how much wickedness has
it brought forth to this time! and how much shall it yet bring forth until the
<a href="#FN13"><span class="notemark">*</span><span class="popup">Or,
threshing floor
</span></a>
 time of threshing come!
 <span class="verse"> 31</span><a name="C4V31">&nbsp;</a>Ponder now by yourself, how great fruit of wickedness a grain of evil seed has brought forth.
 <span class="verse"> 32</span><a name="C4V32">&nbsp;</a>When the ears which are without number shall be sown, how great a floor shall they fill!
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 33</span><a name="C4V33">&nbsp;</a>Then I answered and said,
<a href="#FN14"><span class="notemark">†</span><span class="popup">So the chief oriental versions.
</span></a>
 How long? and when shall these things come to pass? wherefore are our years few and evil?
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 34</span><a name="C4V34">&nbsp;</a>And he answered me, and said, You do not hasten more than the Most High: for your haste is
<a href="#FN15"><span class="notemark">‡</span><span class="popup">So the Syriac. The Latin is corrupt.
</span></a>
 for your own self, but he that is above
<span class="add">hastens
</span> on behalf of many.
 <span class="verse"> 35</span><a name="C4V35">&nbsp;</a>Did not the souls of the righteous ask question of these things in their chambers, saying, How long
<a href="#FN16"><span class="notemark">§</span><span class="popup">So the Syriac. The Latin has
shall I hope on this fashion?
</span></a>
 are we here? when comes the fruit of the
<a href="#FN17"><span class="notemark">**</span><span class="popup">Or,
threshing floor
</span></a>
 threshing time of our reward?
 <span class="verse"> 36</span><a name="C4V36">&nbsp;</a>And to them Jeremiel the archangel gave answer, and said, Even when the number is fulfilled of them that
are like to you. For he has weighed the world in the balance;
 <span class="verse"> 37</span><a name="C4V37">&nbsp;</a>and by measure has he measured the times, and by number has he counted the seasons; and he shall not
<a href="#FN18"><span class="notemark">††</span><span class="popup">Syr.
rest.
</span></a>
 move nor stir them, until the said measure be fulfilled.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 38</span><a name="C4V38">&nbsp;</a>Then answered I and said, O Lord that bear rule, yet even we all are full of impiety:
 <span class="verse"> 39</span><a name="C4V39">&nbsp;</a>and for our sakes perhaps it is that the
<a href="#FN19"><span class="notemark">‡‡</span><span class="popup">Or,
threshing floor
</span></a>
 threshing time of the righteous is kept back, because of the sins of them that dwell upon the earth.
 <span class="verse"> 40</span><a name="C4V40">&nbsp;</a>So he answered me, and said, Go your way to a woman with child, and ask of her when she has fulfilled
her nine months, if her womb may keep the birth any longer within her.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 41</span><a name="C4V41">&nbsp;</a>Then said I, no, Lord, that can it not.
</div>
<div class="p">And he said to me, in the grave the chambers of souls are like the womb:
 <span class="verse"> 42</span><a name="C4V42">&nbsp;</a>for like as a woman that travails makes haste to escape the anguish of the travail: even so do these
places haste to deliver those things that are committed to them from the beginning.
 <span class="verse"> 43</span><a name="C4V43">&nbsp;</a>Then shall it be showed you concerning those things which you desire to see.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 44</span><a name="C4V44">&nbsp;</a>Then answered I and said, if I have found favor in your sight, and if it be possible, and if I be meet
therefore,
 <span class="verse"> 45</span><a name="C4V45">&nbsp;</a>show me this also, whether there be more to come than is past, or whether the more part is gone over
us.
 <span class="verse"> 46</span><a name="C4V46">&nbsp;</a>For what is gone I know, but what is for to come I know not.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 47</span><a name="C4V47">&nbsp;</a>And he said to me, Stand up upon the right side, and I shall expound the similitude to you.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 48</span><a name="C4V48">&nbsp;</a>so I stood, and saw, and, behold, a hot burning oven passed by before me: and it happened, that when
the flame was gone by I looked, and, behold, the smoke remained still.
 <span class="verse"> 49</span><a name="C4V49">&nbsp;</a>After this there passed by before me a watery cloud, and sent down much rain with a storm; and when the
stormy rain was past, the drops remained therein still.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 50</span><a name="C4V50">&nbsp;</a>Then said he to me, Consider with yourself; as the rain is more than the drops, and the fire is greater
than the smoke, so the quantity which is past did more exceed; but the drops and the smoke remained still.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 51</span><a name="C4V51">&nbsp;</a>Then I prayed, and said, May I live, think you, until that time? or who shall be in those days?
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 52</span><a name="C4V52">&nbsp;</a>He answered me, and said, As for the tokens whereof you asked me, I may tell you of them in part: but
as touching your life, I am not sent to show you; for I do not know it.
