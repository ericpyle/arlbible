<div class="mt1">The Second Book of Samuel

<div class="chapterlabel"> 1</div><div class="p">
 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C1V1">&nbsp;</a>After the death of Saul, when David had returned from the slaughter of the Amalekites, and David had
stayed two days in Ziklag;
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C1V2">&nbsp;</a>on the third day, behold,<a href="#FN1"><span class="notemark">*</span><span class="popup">“Behold”, from “הִנֵּה”, means look at, take notice, observe, see, or gaze at. It is often used as an
interjection.</span></a>
 a man came out of the camp from Saul, with his clothes torn, and earth on his head. When he came to
David, he fell to the earth, and showed respect.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C1V3">&nbsp;</a>David said to him, “Where do you come from?”
</div>
<div class="p">He said to him, “I have escaped out of the camp of Israel.”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C1V4">&nbsp;</a>David said to him, “How did it go? Please tell me.”
</div>
<div class="p">He answered, “The people have fled from the battle, and many of the people also have fallen and are dead.
Saul and Jonathan his son are dead also.”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C1V5">&nbsp;</a>David said to the young man who told him, “How do you know that Saul and Jonathan his son are dead?”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C1V6">&nbsp;</a>The young man who told him said, “As I happened by chance on Mount Gilboa, behold, Saul was leaning on
his spear; and behold, the chariots and the horsemen followed close behind him.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C1V7">&nbsp;</a>When he looked behind him, he saw me, and called to me. I answered, ‘Here I am.’
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C1V8">&nbsp;</a>He said to me, ‘Who are you?’ I answered him, ‘I am an Amalekite.’
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C1V9">&nbsp;</a>He said to me, ‘Please stand beside me, and kill me; for anguish has taken hold of me, because my life
lingers in me.’
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C1V10">&nbsp;</a>So I stood beside him and killed him, because I was sure that he could not live after that he had fallen.
I took the crown that was on his head and the bracelet that was on his arm, and have brought them here
to my lord.”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C1V11">&nbsp;</a>Then David took hold on his clothes, and tore them; and all the men who were with him did likewise.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C1V12">&nbsp;</a>They mourned, wept, and fasted until evening, for Saul, and for Jonathan his son, and for the people
of Yahweh,<a href="#FN2"><span class="notemark">†</span><span class="popup">“Yahweh” is God’s proper Name, sometimes rendered “LORD” (all caps) in other translations.</span></a>
 and for the house of Israel; because they had fallen by the sword.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C1V13">&nbsp;</a>David said to the young man who told him, “Where are you from?”
</div>
<div class="p">He answered, “I am the son of a foreigner, an Amalekite.”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C1V14">&nbsp;</a>David said to him, “Why were you not afraid to stretch out your hand to destroy Yahweh’s anointed?”
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C1V15">&nbsp;</a>David called one of the young men, and said, “Go near, and cut him down!” He struck him so that he died.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C1V16">&nbsp;</a>David said to him, “Your blood be on your head; for your mouth has testified against you, saying, ‘I
have slain Yahweh’s anointed.’”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C1V17">&nbsp;</a>David lamented with this lamentation over Saul and over Jonathan his son
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C1V18">&nbsp;</a>(and he commanded them to teach the children of Judah the song of the bow; behold, it is written in the
book of Jashar):

<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C1V19">&nbsp;</a>“Your glory, Israel, was slain on your high places!
</div>
<div class="q2">How the mighty have fallen!
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C1V20">&nbsp;</a>Don’t tell it in Gath.
</div>
<div class="q2">Don’t publish it in the streets of Ashkelon,

<div class="q1">lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice,
</div>
<div class="q2">lest the daughters of the uncircumcised triumph.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C1V21">&nbsp;</a>You mountains of Gilboa,
</div>
<div class="q2">let there be no dew or rain on you, and no fields of offerings;
</div>
<div class="q2">For there the shield of the mighty was defiled and cast away,
</div>
<div class="q2">The shield of Saul was not anointed with oil.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C1V22">&nbsp;</a>From the blood of the slain,
</div>
<div class="q2">from the fat of the mighty,
</div>
<div class="q2">Jonathan’s bow didn’t turn back.
</div>
<div class="q2">Saul’s sword didn’t return empty.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C1V23">&nbsp;</a>Saul and Jonathan were lovely and pleasant in their lives.
</div>
<div class="q2">In their death, they were not divided.
</div>
<div class="q1">They were swifter than eagles.
</div>
<div class="q2">They were stronger than lions.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C1V24">&nbsp;</a>You daughters of Israel, weep over Saul,
</div>
<div class="q2">who clothed you delicately in scarlet,
</div>
<div class="q2">who put ornaments of gold on your clothing.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C1V25">&nbsp;</a>How the mighty have fallen in the middle of the battle!
</div>
<div class="q2">Jonathan was slain on your high places.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C1V26">&nbsp;</a>I am distressed for you, my brother Jonathan.
</div>
<div class="q2">You have been very pleasant to me.
</div>
<div class="q2">Your love to me was wonderful,
</div>
<div class="q2">passing the love of women.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C1V27">&nbsp;</a>How the mighty have fallen,

<div class="q2">and the weapons of war have perished!”
