 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C7V1">&nbsp;</a>And when I had made an end of speaking these words, there was sent to me the angel which had been sent
to me the nights before:
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C7V2">&nbsp;</a>and he said to me, Up, Esdras, and hear the words that I am come to tell you.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C7V3">&nbsp;</a>And I said, Speak on, my Lord. Then he said to me, There is a sea set in a wide place, that it might
be
<a href="#FN1"><span class="notemark">*</span><span class="popup">So the chief Oriental versions. The Latin MSS. have

</span></a>
 broad and vast.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C7V4">&nbsp;</a>But the entrance thereof shall be set in a narrow place so as to be like a river;
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C7V5">&nbsp;</a>whoso then should desire to go into the sea to look upon it, or to rule it, if he went not through the
narrow, how could he come into the broad?
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C7V6">&nbsp;</a>Another thing also: There is a city builded and set in a plain country, and full of all good things;
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C7V7">&nbsp;</a>but the entrance thereof is narrow, and is set in a dangerous place to fall, having a fire on the right
hand, and on the left a deep water:
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C7V8">&nbsp;</a>and there is one only path between them both, even between the fire and the water,
<span class="add">so small
</span> that there could but one man go there at once.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C7V9">&nbsp;</a>If this city now be given to a man for an inheritance, if the heir pass not the danger before him, how
shall he receive his inheritance?
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C7V10">&nbsp;</a>And I said, It is so, Lord. Then said he to me, Even so also is Israel’s portion.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C7V11">&nbsp;</a>Because for their sakes I made the world: and when Adam transgressed my statutes, then was decreed that
now is done.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C7V12">&nbsp;</a>Then were the entrances of this world made narrow, and sorrowful and toilsome: they are but few and evil,
full of perils, and charged with great toils.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C7V13">&nbsp;</a>For the entrances of the greater world are wide and sure, and bring forth fruit of immortality.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C7V14">&nbsp;</a>If then they that live enter not these strait and vain things, they can never receive those that are
laid up for them.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C7V15">&nbsp;</a>Now therefore why you disquiet yourself, seeing you are but a corruptible man? and why are you moved,
whereas you are but mortal?
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C7V16">&nbsp;</a>and why have you not considered in your mind that which is to come, rather than that which is present?
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C7V17">&nbsp;</a>Then answered I and said, O Lord that bear rule, behold, you have ordained in your law, that the righteous
should inherit these things, but that the ungodly should perish.
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C7V18">&nbsp;</a>The righteous therefore shall suffer strait things, and hope for wide: but they that have done wickedly
<a href="#FN2"><span class="notemark">†</span><span class="popup">According to some authorities,

</span></a>
 have suffered the strait things, and yet shall not see the wide.
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C7V19">&nbsp;</a>And he said to me,
<a href="#FN3"><span class="notemark">‡</span><span class="popup">Another reading is,
There is no judge...and none that has understanding.
</span></a>
 You are not a judge above God, neither have you understanding above the Most High.
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C7V20">&nbsp;</a>Yes, rather let many that now be perish, than that the law of God which is set before them be despised.
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C7V21">&nbsp;</a>For God straitly commanded such as came, even as they came, what they should do to live, and what they
should observe to avoid punishment.
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C7V22">&nbsp;</a>Nevertheless they were not obedient to him; but spoke against him, and imagined for themselves vain things;
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C7V23">&nbsp;</a>and framed cunning devices of wickedness; and said moreover of the Most High, that he is not; and knew
not his ways:
 <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C7V24">&nbsp;</a>but they despised his law, and denied his covenants; they have not been faithful to his statutes, and
have not performed his works.
 <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C7V25">&nbsp;</a>Therefore, Esdras, for the empty are empty things, and for the full are the full things.
 <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C7V26">&nbsp;</a>For behold, the time shall come, and it shall be, when these tokens, of which I told you before, shall
come to pass, that the bride shall appear, even the city coming forth, and she shall be seen, that now
is withdrawn from the earth.
 <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C7V27">&nbsp;</a>And whoever is delivered from the foresaid evils, the same shall see my wonders.
 <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C7V28">&nbsp;</a>For my son Jesus shall be revealed with those that be with him, and shall rejoice them that remain four
hundred years.

 <span class="verse"> 30</span><a name="C7V30">&nbsp;</a>And the world shall be turned into the old silence seven days, like as in the first beginning: so that
no man shall remain.
 <span class="verse"> 31</span><a name="C7V31">&nbsp;</a>And after seven days the world, that yet awakens not, shall be raised up, and that shall die that is
corruptible.
 <span class="verse"> 32</span><a name="C7V32">&nbsp;</a>And the earth shall restore those that are asleep in her, and so shall the dust those that dwell therein

 <span class="verse"> 43</span><a name="C7V43">&nbsp;</a>for it shall endure as it were a week of years.
 <span class="verse"> 44</span><a name="C7V44">&nbsp;</a>This is my judgement and the ordinance thereof; but to you only have I showed these things.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 45</span><a name="C7V45">&nbsp;</a>And I answered, I said even then, O Lord, and I say now: blessed are they that be now alive and keep
the

</span> ordained of you.
 <span class="verse"> 46</span><a name="C7V46">&nbsp;</a>But as touching them for whom my prayer was made,
<span class="add">what shall I say?
</span> for who is there of them that be alive that has not sinned, and who of the sons
<span class="add">of men
</span> that has not transgressed your covenant?
 <span class="verse"> 47</span><a name="C7V47">&nbsp;</a>And now I see, that the world to come shall bring delight to few, but torments to many.
 <span class="verse"> 48</span><a name="C7V48">&nbsp;</a>For an evil heart has grown up in us, which has led us astray from these
<span class="add">statutes,
</span> and has brought us into corruption and into the ways of death, has showed us the paths of perdition
and removed us far from life; and that, not a few only, but well near all that have been created.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 49</span><a name="C7V49">&nbsp;</a>And he answered me, and said, Hearken to me, and I will instruct you; and I will admonish you yet again:

 <span class="verse"> 51</span><a name="C7V51">&nbsp;</a>For whereas you have said that the just are not many, but few, and the ungodly abound, hear
<span class="add">the answer

 will you set for you over against them according to their number
<span class="add">things of

</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 53</span><a name="C7V53">&nbsp;</a>And I said, Lord, how shall this be?
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 54</span><a name="C7V54">&nbsp;</a>And he said to me, Not only this, but ask the earth, and she shall tell you; entreat her, and she shall
declare to you.
 <span class="verse"> 55</span><a name="C7V55">&nbsp;</a>For you shall say to her, You bring forth gold and silver and brass, and iron also and lead and clay:
 <span class="verse"> 56</span><a name="C7V56">&nbsp;</a>but silver is more abundant than gold, and brass than silver, and iron than brass, lead than iron, and
clay than lead.
 <span class="verse"> 57</span><a name="C7V57">&nbsp;</a>Judge you therefore which things are precious and to be desired, whatso is abundant or what is rare.

<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 58</span><a name="C7V58">&nbsp;</a>And I said, O Lord that bear rule, that which is plentiful is of less worth, for that which is more rare
is more precious.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 59</span><a name="C7V59">&nbsp;</a>And he answered me, and said,

</span></a>
 Weigh within yourself the things that you have thought, for he that has what is hard to get rejoices
over him that has what is plentiful.
 <span class="verse"> 60</span><a name="C7V60">&nbsp;</a>So also is the
<a href="#FN14"><span class="notemark">†</span><span class="popup">The Latin is here corrupt.
</span></a>
 judgement which I have promised: for I will rejoice over the few that shall be saved, inasmuch as these
are they that have made my glory now to prevail, and of whom my name is now named.
 <span class="verse"> 61</span><a name="C7V61">&nbsp;</a>And I will not grieve over the multitude of them that perish; for these are they that are now like to
vapor, and are become as flame and smoke; they are set on fire and burn hotly, and are quenched.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 62</span><a name="C7V62">&nbsp;</a>And I answered and said, O you earth, wherefore have you brought forth, if the mind is made out of dust,
like as all other created things?
 <span class="verse"> 63</span><a name="C7V63">&nbsp;</a>For it were better that the dust itself had been unborn, so that the mind might not have been made therefrom.
 <span class="verse"> 64</span><a name="C7V64">&nbsp;</a>But now the mind grows with us, and by reason of this we are tormented, because we perish and know it.
 <span class="verse"> 65</span><a name="C7V65">&nbsp;</a>Let the race of men lament and the beasts of the field be glad; let all that are born lament, but let
the four-footed beasts and the cattle rejoice.
 <span class="verse"> 66</span><a name="C7V66">&nbsp;</a>For it is far better with them than with us; for they look not for judgement, neither do they know of
torments or of salvation promised to them after death.
 <span class="verse"> 67</span><a name="C7V67">&nbsp;</a>For what does it profit us, that we shall be preserved alive, but yet be afflicted with torment?
 <span class="verse"> 68</span><a name="C7V68">&nbsp;</a>For all that are born are
<a href="#FN15"><span class="notemark">‡</span><span class="popup">The Latin is here corrupt.
</span></a>
 defiled with iniquities, and are full of sins and laden with offences:
 <span class="verse"> 69</span><a name="C7V69">&nbsp;</a>and if after death we were not to come into judgement, perhaps it had been better for us.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 70</span><a name="C7V70">&nbsp;</a>And he answered me, and said, When the Most High made the world, and Adam and all them that came of him,
he first prepared the Judgement and the things that pertain to the judgement.
 <span class="verse"> 71</span><a name="C7V71">&nbsp;</a>And now understand from your own words, for you have said that the mind grows with us.
 <span class="verse"> 72</span><a name="C7V72">&nbsp;</a>They therefore that dwell upon the earth shall be tormented for this reason, that having understanding
they have wrought iniquity, and receiving commandments have not kept them, and having obtained a law
they dealt unfaithfully with that which they received.
 <span class="verse"> 73</span><a name="C7V73">&nbsp;</a>What then will they have to say in the judgement, or how will they answer in the last times?
 <span class="verse"> 74</span><a name="C7V74">&nbsp;</a>For how great a time has the Most High been longsuffering with them that inhabit the world, and not for
their sakes, but because of the times which he has foreordained!
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 75</span><a name="C7V75">&nbsp;</a>And I answered and said, if I have found grace in your sight, O Lord, show this also to your servant,
whether after death, even now when every one of us gives up his soul, we shall be kept in rest until
those times come, in which you shall renew the creation, or whether we shall be tormented forthwith.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 76</span><a name="C7V76">&nbsp;</a>And he answered me, and said, I will show you this also; but join not yourself with them that are scorners,
nor count yourself with them that are tormented.
 <span class="verse"> 77</span><a name="C7V77">&nbsp;</a>For you have a treasure of
<span class="add">good
</span> works laid up with the Most High, but it shall not be showed you until the last times.
 <span class="verse"> 78</span><a name="C7V78">&nbsp;</a>For concerning death the teaching is: When the determinate sentence has gone forth from the Most High
that a man should die, as the spirit leaves the body to return again to him who gave it, it adores the
glory of the Most High first of all.
 <span class="verse"> 79</span><a name="C7V79">&nbsp;</a>And if it be one of those that have been scorners and have not kept the way of the Most High, and that
have despised his law, and that hate them that fear

</span></a>
 God,
 <span class="verse"> 80</span><a name="C7V80">&nbsp;</a>these spirits shall not enter into habitations, but shall wander and be in torments forthwith, ever grieving
and sad, in seven ways.
 <span class="verse"> 81</span><a name="C7V81">&nbsp;</a>The first way, because they have despised the law of the Most High.
 <span class="verse"> 82</span><a name="C7V82">&nbsp;</a>The second way, because they can’t now make a good returning that they may live.
 <span class="verse"> 83</span><a name="C7V83">&nbsp;</a>The third way, they shall see the reward laid up for them that have believed the covenants of the Most
High.
 <span class="verse"> 84</span><a name="C7V84">&nbsp;</a>The fourth way, they shall consider the torment laid up for themselves in the last days.
 <span class="verse"> 85</span><a name="C7V85">&nbsp;</a>The fifth way, they shall see the dwelling places of the others guarded by angels, with great quietness.
 <span class="verse"> 86</span><a name="C7V86">&nbsp;</a>The sixth way, they shall see
<a href="#FN17"><span class="notemark">**</span><span class="popup">The passage is corrupt.
</span></a>
 how forthwith some of them shall pass into torment.
 <span class="verse"> 87</span><a name="C7V87">&nbsp;</a>The seventh way, which is
<a href="#FN18"><span class="notemark">††</span><span class="popup">Lat.
greater
</span></a>
 more grievous than all the aforesaid ways, because they shall pine away in confusion and be consumed
with
<a href="#FN19"><span class="notemark">‡‡</span><span class="popup">The Latin is here corrupt.
</span></a>
 shame, and shall be withered up by fears, seeing the glory of the Most High before whom they have sinned
while living, and before whom they shall be judged in the last times.
 <span class="verse"> 88</span><a name="C7V88">&nbsp;</a>Now this is the order of those who have kept the ways of the Most High, when they shall be separated
from the corruptible vessel.
 <span class="verse"> 89</span><a name="C7V89">&nbsp;</a>In the time
<a href="#FN20"><span class="notemark">§§</span><span class="popup">The Latin is here corrupt.
</span></a>
 that they lived therein they painfully served the Most High, and were in jeopardy every hour, that they
might keep the law of the lawgiver perfectly.
 <span class="verse"> 90</span><a name="C7V90">&nbsp;</a>Wherefore this is the teaching concerning them:
 <span class="verse"> 91</span><a name="C7V91">&nbsp;</a>First of all they shall see with great joy the glory of him who takes them up, for they shall have rest
in seven orders.
 <span class="verse"> 92</span><a name="C7V92">&nbsp;</a>The first order, because they have striven with great labor to overcome the evil thought which was fashoned
together with them, that it might not lead them astray from life into death.
 <span class="verse"> 93</span><a name="C7V93">&nbsp;</a>The second order, because they see the perplexity in which the souls of the ungodly wander, and the punishment
that awaits them.
 <span class="verse"> 94</span><a name="C7V94">&nbsp;</a>The third order, they see the witness which he that fashioned them bears concerning them, that while
they lived they kept the law which was given them in trust.
 <span class="verse"> 95</span><a name="C7V95">&nbsp;</a>The fourth order, they understand the rest which, being gathered in their chambers, they now enjoy with
great quietness, guarded by angels, and the glory that awaits them in the last days.
 <span class="verse"> 96</span><a name="C7V96">&nbsp;</a>The fifth order, they rejoice,
<span class="add">seeing
</span> how they have now escaped from that which is corruptible, and how they shall inherit that which is to
come, while they see moreover the straitness and the
<a href="#FN21"><span class="notemark">***</span><span class="popup">The Latin is here corrupt.
</span></a>
 painfulness from which they have been delivered, and the large room which they shall receive with joy
and immortality.
 <span class="verse"> 97</span><a name="C7V97">&nbsp;</a>The sixth order, when it is showed to them how their face shall shine as the sun, and how they shall
be made like to the light of the stars, being henceforth incorruptible.
 <span class="verse"> 98</span><a name="C7V98">&nbsp;</a>The seventh order, which is greater than all the aforesaid orders, because they shall rejoice with confidence,
and because they shall be bold without confusion, and shall be glad without fear, for they hasten to
behold the face of him whom in their lifetine they served, and from whom they shall receive
<span class="add">their
</span> reward in glory.
 <span class="verse"> 99</span><a name="C7V99">&nbsp;</a>This is the order of the souls of the just, as from henceforth

 is announcer to them,
<span class="add">and
</span> aforesaid are the ways of torture which they that would not give heed shall suffer from henceforth.
 <span class="verse"> 100</span><a name="C7V100">&nbsp;</a>And I answered and said, shall time therefore be given to the souls after they are separated from the
bodies, that they may see that whereof you have spoken to me?
 <span class="verse"> 101</span><a name="C7V101">&nbsp;</a>And he said, Their freedom shall be for seven days, that for seven days they may see the things whereof
you have been told, and afterwards they shall be gathered together in their habitations.
 <span class="verse"> 102</span><a name="C7V102">&nbsp;</a>And I answered and said, if I have found favor in your sight, show further to me your servant whether
in the day of judgment the just will be able to intercede for the ungodly or to entreat the Most High
for them,
 <span class="verse"> 103</span><a name="C7V103">&nbsp;</a>whether fathers for children, or children for parents, or brethren for brethren, or kinsfolk for their

 in that day, neither shall one lay a burden on another, for then shall all bear every one his own righteousness
or unrighteousness.

<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 106</span><a name="C7V106">&nbsp;</a>And I answered and said, How do we now find that first Abraham prayed for the people of Sodom, and Moses
for the fathers that sinned in the wilderness:
 <span class="verse"> 107</span><a name="C7V107">&nbsp;</a>and Joshua after him for Israel in the days of

 in the days of Saul; and David for the plague: and Solomon for them that
<span class="add">should worship

 <span class="verse"> 109</span><a name="C7V109">&nbsp;</a>and Elijah for those that received rain; and for the dead, that he might live:
 <span class="verse"> 110</span><a name="C7V110">&nbsp;</a>and Hezekiah for the people in the days of Sennacherib: and many for many?
 <span class="verse"> 111</span><a name="C7V111">&nbsp;</a>If therefore now, when corruption is grown up, and unrighteousness increased, the righteous have prayed
for the ungodly, wherefore shall it not be so then also?
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 112</span><a name="C7V112">&nbsp;</a>He answered me, and said, This present world is not the end; the full glory remains

<a href="#FN31"><span class="notemark">‡‡</span><span class="popup">Omitted in the Latin.

 and the beginning of the immortality for to come, wherein corruption is passed away,
 <span class="verse"> 114</span><a name="C7V114">&nbsp;</a>intemperance is at an end, infidelity is cut off, but righteousness is grown, and truth is sprung up.
 <span class="verse"> 115</span><a name="C7V115">&nbsp;</a>Then shall no man be able to have mercy on him that is cast in judgement, nor to thrust down him that
has gotten the victory.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 116</span><a name="C7V116">&nbsp;</a>I answered then and said, this is my first and last saying, that it had been better that the earth had
not given
<span class="add">you
</span> Adam: or else, when it had given
<span class="add">him,
</span> to have restrained him from sinning.
 <span class="verse"> 117</span><a name="C7V117">&nbsp;</a>For what profit is it for all that are in this present time to live in heaviness, and after death to
look for punishment?
 <span class="verse"> 118</span><a name="C7V118">&nbsp;</a>O you Adam, what have you done? For though it was you that sinned, the evil is not fallen on you alone,
but upon all of us that come of you.
 <span class="verse"> 119</span><a name="C7V119">&nbsp;</a>For what profit is it to us, if there be promised us an immortal time, whereas we have done the works
that bring death?
 <span class="verse"> 120</span><a name="C7V120">&nbsp;</a>And that there is promised us an everlasting hope, whereas ourselves most miserably are become vain?
 <span class="verse"> 121</span><a name="C7V121">&nbsp;</a>And that there are reserved habitations of health and safety, whereas we have lived wickedly?
 <span class="verse"> 122</span><a name="C7V122">&nbsp;</a>And that the glory of the Most High shall defend them which have led a pure life, whereas we have walked
in the most wicked ways of all?
 <span class="verse"> 123</span><a name="C7V123">&nbsp;</a>And that there shall be showed a paradise, whose fruit endures without decay, wherein is abundance and
healing, but we shall not enter into it,
 <span class="verse"> 124</span><a name="C7V124">&nbsp;</a>for we have walked in unpleasant places?
 <span class="verse"> 125</span><a name="C7V125">&nbsp;</a>And that the faces of them which have used abstinence shall shine above the stars, whereas our faces
shall be blacker than darkness?
 <span class="verse"> 126</span><a name="C7V126">&nbsp;</a>For while we lived and committed iniquity, we considered not what we should have to suffer after death.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 127</span><a name="C7V127">&nbsp;</a>Then he answered and said, This is the
<a href="#FN32"><span class="notemark">§§</span><span class="popup">Or,
intent
</span></a>
 condition of the battle, which man that is born upon the earth shall fight;
 <span class="verse"> 128</span><a name="C7V128">&nbsp;</a>that, if he be overcome, he shall suffer as you have said: but if he get the victory, he shall receive
the thing that I say.
 <span class="verse"> 129</span><a name="C7V129">&nbsp;</a>For this is the way whereof Moses spoke to the people while he lived, saying, Choose you life, that you
may live.
 <span class="verse"> 130</span><a name="C7V130">&nbsp;</a>Nevertheless they believed not him, nor yet the prophets after him, no, nor me which have spoken to them;
 <span class="verse"> 131</span><a name="C7V131">&nbsp;</a>so that there shall not be such heaviness in their destruction, as there shall be joy over them that
are persuaded to salvation.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 132</span><a name="C7V132">&nbsp;</a>I answered then and said, I know, Lord, that the Most High is now called merciful, in that he has mercy
upon them which are not yet come into the world;
 <span class="verse"> 133</span><a name="C7V133">&nbsp;</a>and compassionate, in that he has compassion upon those that turn to his law;
 <span class="verse"> 134</span><a name="C7V134">&nbsp;</a>and longsuffering, for that he long suffers those that have sinned, as his creatures;
 <span class="verse"> 135</span><a name="C7V135">&nbsp;</a>and bountiful, for that he is ready to give rather than to exact;
 <span class="verse"> 136</span><a name="C7V136">&nbsp;</a>and of great mercy, for that he multiplies more and more mercies to them that are present, and that are
past, and also to them which are to come;
 <span class="verse"> 137</span><a name="C7V137">&nbsp;</a>(for if he multiplied not
<span class="add">his mercies,
</span> the world would not continue with them that dwell therein;)
 <span class="verse"> 138</span><a name="C7V138">&nbsp;</a>and one that forgives, for if he did not forgive of his goodness, that they which have committed iniquities
might be eased of them, the ten thousandth part of men would not remain living;
