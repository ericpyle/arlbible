 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C5V1">&nbsp;</a>But concerning the times and the seasons, brothers, you have no need that anything be written to you.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C5V2">&nbsp;</a>For you yourselves know well that the day of the Lord comes like a thief in the night.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C5V3">&nbsp;</a>For when they are saying, “Peace and safety,” then sudden destruction will come on them, like birth pains
on a pregnant woman; and they will in no way escape.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C5V4">&nbsp;</a>But you, brothers, aren’t in darkness, that the day should overtake you like a thief.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C5V5">&nbsp;</a>You are all children of light, and children of the day. We don’t belong to the night, nor to darkness,
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C5V6">&nbsp;</a>so then let’s not sleep, as the rest do, but let’s watch and be sober.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C5V7">&nbsp;</a>For those who sleep, sleep in the night; and those who are drunk are drunk in the night.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C5V8">&nbsp;</a>But let us, since we belong to the day, be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love, and,
for a helmet, the hope of salvation.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C5V9">&nbsp;</a>For God didn’t appoint us to wrath, but to the obtaining of salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ,
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C5V10">&nbsp;</a>who died for us, that, whether we wake or sleep, we should live together with him.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C5V11">&nbsp;</a>Therefore exhort one another, and build each other up, even as you also do.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C5V12">&nbsp;</a>But we beg you, brothers, to know those who labor among you, and are over you in the Lord, and admonish
you,
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C5V13">&nbsp;</a>and to respect and honor them in love for their work’s sake.
</div>
<div class="p">Be at peace among yourselves.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C5V14">&nbsp;</a>We exhort you, brothers, admonish the disorderly, encourage the faint-hearted, support the weak, be patient
toward all.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C5V15">&nbsp;</a>See that no one returns evil for evil to anyone, but always follow after that which is good, for one
another, and for all.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C5V16">&nbsp;</a>Rejoice always.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C5V17">&nbsp;</a>Pray without ceasing.
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C5V18">&nbsp;</a>In everything give thanks, for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus toward you.
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C5V19">&nbsp;</a>Don’t quench the Spirit.
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C5V20">&nbsp;</a>Don’t despise prophesies.
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C5V21">&nbsp;</a>Test all things, and hold firmly that which is good.
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C5V22">&nbsp;</a>Abstain from every form of evil.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C5V23">&nbsp;</a>May the God of peace himself sanctify you completely. May your whole spirit, soul, and body be preserved
blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C5V24">&nbsp;</a>He who calls you is faithful, who will also do it.
 <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C5V25">&nbsp;</a>Brothers, pray for us.
 <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C5V26">&nbsp;</a>Greet all the brothers with a holy kiss.
 <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C5V27">&nbsp;</a>I solemnly command you by the Lord that this letter be read to all the holy brothers.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C5V28">&nbsp;</a>The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. Amen.
