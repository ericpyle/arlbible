 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C6V1">&nbsp;</a>Brothers, even if a man is caught in some fault, you who are spiritual must restore such a one in a spirit
of gentleness; looking to yourself so that you also aren’t tempted.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C6V2">&nbsp;</a>Bear one another’s burdens, and so fulfill the law of Christ.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C6V3">&nbsp;</a>For if a man thinks himself to be something when he is nothing, he deceives himself.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C6V4">&nbsp;</a>But let each man examine his own work, and then he will have reason to boast in himself, and not in someone
else.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C6V5">&nbsp;</a>For each man will bear his own burden.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C6V6">&nbsp;</a>But let him who is taught in the word share all good things with him who teaches.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C6V7">&nbsp;</a>Don’t be deceived. God is not mocked, for whatever a man sows, that he will also reap.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C6V8">&nbsp;</a>For he who sows to his own flesh will from the flesh reap corruption. But he who sows to the Spirit will
from the Spirit reap eternal life.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C6V9">&nbsp;</a>Let us not be weary in doing good, for we will reap in due season, if we don’t give up.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C6V10">&nbsp;</a>So then, as we have opportunity, let’s do what is good toward all men, and especially toward those who
are of the household of the faith.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C6V11">&nbsp;</a>See with what large letters I write to you with my own hand.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C6V12">&nbsp;</a>As many as desire to look good in the flesh, they compel you to be circumcised; only that they may not
be persecuted for the cross of Christ.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C6V13">&nbsp;</a>For even they who receive circumcision don’t keep the law themselves, but they desire to have you circumcised,
that they may boast in your flesh.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C6V14">&nbsp;</a>But far be it from me to boast, except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through which the world
has been crucified to me, and I to the world.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C6V15">&nbsp;</a>For in Christ Jesus neither is circumcision anything, nor uncircumcision, but a new creation.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C6V16">&nbsp;</a>As many as walk by this rule, peace and mercy be on them, and on God’s Israel.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C6V17">&nbsp;</a>From now on, let no one cause me any trouble, for I bear the marks of the Lord Jesus branded on my body.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C6V18">&nbsp;</a>The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit, brothers. Amen.
