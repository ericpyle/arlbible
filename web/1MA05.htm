 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C5V1">&nbsp;</a>And it came to pass, when the Gentiles round about heard that the altar was built, and the sanctuary
dedicated as aforetime, they were exceeding angry.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C5V2">&nbsp;</a>And they took counsel to destroy the race of Jacob that was in the midst of them, and they began to kill
and destroy among the people.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C5V3">&nbsp;</a>And Judas fought against the children of Esau in Idumaea at Akrabattine, because they besieged Israel:
and he struck them with a great slaughter, and brought down their pride, and took their spoils.

<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C5V9">&nbsp;</a>And the Gentiles that were in Gilead gathered themselves together against the Israelites that were on
their borders, to destroy them. And they fled to the stronghold of Dathema,
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C5V10">&nbsp;</a>and sent letters to Judas and his brethren, saying, The Gentiles that are round about us are gathered
together against us to destroy us:
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C5V11">&nbsp;</a>and they are preparing to come and get possession of the stronghold whereunto we are fled for refuge,
and Timotheus is the leader of their host.

what they should do for their brethren, that were in tribulation, and were assaulted of them.

Galilee, but I and Jonathan my brother will go into the land of Gilead.
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C5V18">&nbsp;</a>And he left Joseph the son of Zacharias, and Azarias, as leaders of the people, with the remnant of the
host, in Judaea, for to keep it.

the Gentiles until that we come again.

have appointed to encamp against the strongholds, and to take them, and to destroy all these men in one
day.
 <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C5V28">&nbsp;</a>And Judas and his army turned suddenly by the way of the wilderness to Bosora; and he took the city,
and killed all the males with the edge of the sword, and took all their spoils, and burned the city with
fire.
 <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C5V29">&nbsp;</a>And he removed from thence by night, and went till he came to the stronghold.
 <span class="verse"> 30</span><a name="C5V30">&nbsp;</a>And the morning came, and they lifted up their eyes, and, behold, much people which could not be counted,
bearing ladders and engines of war, to take the stronghold; and they were fighting against them.
 <span class="verse"> 31</span><a name="C5V31">&nbsp;</a>And Judas saw that the battle was begun, and that the cry of the city went up to heaven, with trumpets
and a great sound,
 <span class="verse"> 32</span><a name="C5V32">&nbsp;</a>and he said to the men of his host, Fight this day for your brethren.
 <span class="verse"> 33</span><a name="C5V33">&nbsp;</a>And he went forth behind them in three companies, and they sounded with their trumpets, and cried out
in prayer.
 <span class="verse"> 34</span><a name="C5V34">&nbsp;</a>And the army of Timotheus perceived that it was Maccabaeus, and they fled from before him: and he struck
them with a great slaughter; and there fell of them on that day about eight thousand men.
 <span class="verse"> 35</span><a name="C5V35">&nbsp;</a>And he turned aside to Mizpeh and fought against it, and took it, and killed all the males thereof, and
took the spoils thereof, and burned it with fire.

<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 37</span><a name="C5V37">&nbsp;</a>Now after these things Timotheus gathered another army, and encamped over against Raphon beyond the brook.
 <span class="verse"> 38</span><a name="C5V38">&nbsp;</a>And Judas sent men to espy the army; and they brought him word, saying, All the Gentiles that be round
about us are gathered together to them, an exceeding great host.
 <span class="verse"> 39</span><a name="C5V39">&nbsp;</a>And they have hired Arabians to help them, and are encamping beyond the brook, ready to come against
you to battle. And Judas went to meet them.
 <span class="verse"> 40</span><a name="C5V40">&nbsp;</a>And Timotheus said to the captains of his host, when Judas and his army drew near to the brook of water,
If he pass over first to us, we shall not be able to withstand him; for he will mightily prevail against
us:
 <span class="verse"> 41</span><a name="C5V41">&nbsp;</a>but if he be afraid, and encamp beyond the river, we will cross over to him, and prevail against him.
 <span class="verse"> 42</span><a name="C5V42">&nbsp;</a>Now when Judas came near to the brook of water, he caused the scribes of the people to remain by the
brook, and gave commandment to them, saying, Suffer no man to encamp, but let all come to the battle.
 <span class="verse"> 43</span><a name="C5V43">&nbsp;</a>And he crossed over the first against them, and all the people after him: and all the Gentiles were discomfited
before his face, and cast away their arms, and fled to the temple at

 Carnaim.
 <span class="verse"> 44</span><a name="C5V44">&nbsp;</a>And they took the city, and burned the temple with fire, together with all that were therein. And Carnaim
was subdued, neither could they stand any longer before the face of Judas.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 45</span><a name="C5V45">&nbsp;</a>And Judas gathered together all Israel, them that were in the land of Gilead, from the least to the greatest,
and their wives, and their children, and their stuff, an exceeding great army, that they might come into
the land of Judah.
 <span class="verse"> 46</span><a name="C5V46">&nbsp;</a>And they came as far as Ephron, and this same city was great,
<span class="add">and it was
</span> in the way as they should go, exceeding strong: they could not turn aside from it on the right hand
or on the left, but must needs pass through the midst of it.
 <span class="verse"> 47</span><a name="C5V47">&nbsp;</a>And they of the city shut them out, and stopped up the gates with stones.
 <span class="verse"> 48</span><a name="C5V48">&nbsp;</a>And Judas sent to them with words of peace, saying, We will pass through your land to go into our own
land, and none shall do you any hurt, we will only pass by on our feet. And they would not open to him.
 <span class="verse"> 49</span><a name="C5V49">&nbsp;</a>And Judas commanded proclamation to be made in the army, that each man should encamp in the place where
he was.
 <span class="verse"> 50</span><a name="C5V50">&nbsp;</a>And the men of the host encamped, and fought against the city all that day and all that night, and the
city was delivered into his hands;
 <span class="verse"> 51</span><a name="C5V51">&nbsp;</a>and he destroyed all the males with the edge of the sword, and rased the city, and took the spoils thereof,
and passed through the city over them that were slain.
 <span class="verse"> 52</span><a name="C5V52">&nbsp;</a>And they went over Jordan into the great plain over against Bethshan.
 <span class="verse"> 53</span><a name="C5V53">&nbsp;</a>And Judas gathered together those that lagged behind, and encouraged the people all the way through,
until he came into the land of Judah.
 <span class="verse"> 54</span><a name="C5V54">&nbsp;</a>And they went up to mount Sion with gladness and joy, and offered whole burnt offerings, because not
so much as one of them was slain until they returned in peace.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 55</span><a name="C5V55">&nbsp;</a>And in the days when Judas and Jonathan were in the land of Gilead, and Simon his brother in Galilee
before Ptolemais,
 <span class="verse"> 56</span><a name="C5V56">&nbsp;</a>Joseph the son of Zacharias, and Azarias, rulers of the host, heard of their exploits and of the war,
what things they had done;
 <span class="verse"> 57</span><a name="C5V57">&nbsp;</a>and they said, Let us also get us a name, and let us go fight against the Gentiles that are round about
us.
 <span class="verse"> 58</span><a name="C5V58">&nbsp;</a>And they gave charge to the men of the host that was with them, and went toward Jamnia.
 <span class="verse"> 59</span><a name="C5V59">&nbsp;</a>And Gorgias and his men came out of the city to meet them in battle.
 <span class="verse"> 60</span><a name="C5V60">&nbsp;</a>And Joseph and Azarias were put to flight, and were pursued to the borders of Judaea; and there fell
on that day of the people of Israel about two thousand men.
 <span class="verse"> 61</span><a name="C5V61">&nbsp;</a>And there was a great overthrow among the people, because they hearkened not to Judas and his brethren,
thinking to do some exploit.
 <span class="verse"> 62</span><a name="C5V62">&nbsp;</a>But they were not of the seed of those men, by whose hand deliverance was given to Israel.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 63</span><a name="C5V63">&nbsp;</a>And the man Judas and his brethren were glorified exceedingly in the sight of all Israel, and of all
