 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C14V1">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">“Don’t let your heart be troubled. Believe in God. Believe also in me.
</span> <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C14V2">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">In my Father’s house are many homes. If it weren’t so, I would have told you. I am going to prepare a
place for you.
</span> <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C14V3">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">If I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and will receive you to myself; that where I
am, you may be there also.
</span> <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C14V4">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Where I go, you know, and you know the way.”</span></div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C14V5">&nbsp;</a>Thomas said to him, “Lord, we don’t know where you are going. How can we know the way?”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C14V6">&nbsp;</a>Jesus said to him,
<span class="wj">“I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father, except through me.
</span> <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C14V7">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">If you had known me, you would have known my Father also. From now on, you know him, and have seen him.”</span></div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C14V8">&nbsp;</a>Philip said to him, “Lord, show us the Father, and that will be enough for us.”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C14V9">&nbsp;</a>Jesus said to him,
<span class="wj">“Have I been with you such a long time, and do you not know me, Philip? He who has seen me has seen the
Father. How do you say, ‘Show us the Father?’
</span> <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C14V10">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Don’t you believe that I am in the Father, and the Father in me? The words that I tell you, I speak not
from myself; but the Father who lives in me does his works.
</span> <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C14V11">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Believe me that I am in the Father, and the Father in me; or else believe me for the very works’ sake.
</span> <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C14V12">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Most certainly I tell you, he who believes in me, the works that I do, he will do also; and he will do
greater works than these, because I am going to my Father.
</span> <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C14V13">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Whatever you will ask in my name, that will I do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son.
</span> <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C14V14">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">If you will ask anything in my name, I will do it.
</span> <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C14V15">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">If you love me, keep my commandments.
</span> <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C14V16">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">I will pray to the Father, and he will give you another Counselor,
</span><a href="#FN1"><span class="notemark">*</span><span class="popup">Greek παρακλητον: Counselor, Helper, Intercessor, Advocate, and Comforter.</span></a>
<span class="wj">that he may be with you forever,—</span> <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C14V17">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">the Spirit of truth, whom the world can’t receive; for it doesn’t see him, neither knows him. You know
him, for he lives with you, and will be in you.
</span> <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C14V18">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">I will not leave you orphans. I will come to you.
</span> <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C14V19">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Yet a little while, and the world will see me no more; but you will see me. Because I live, you will
live also.
</span> <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C14V20">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">In that day you will know that I am in my Father, and you in me, and I in you.
</span> <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C14V21">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">One who has my commandments, and keeps them, that person is one who loves me. One who loves me will be
loved by my Father, and I will love him, and will reveal myself to him.”</span></div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C14V22">&nbsp;</a>Judas (not Iscariot) said to him, “Lord, what has happened that you are about to reveal yourself to us,
and not to the world?”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C14V23">&nbsp;</a>Jesus answered him,
<span class="wj">“If a man loves me, he will keep my word. My Father will love him, and we will come to him, and make
our home with him.
</span> <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C14V24">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">He who doesn’t love me doesn’t keep my words. The word which you hear isn’t mine, but the Father’s who
sent me.
</span> <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C14V25">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">I have said these things to you, while still living with you.
</span> <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C14V26">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">But the Counselor, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, he will teach you all things,
and will remind you of all that I said to you.
</span> <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C14V27">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Peace I leave with you. My peace I give to you; not as the world gives, give I to you. Don’t let your
heart be troubled, neither let it be fearful.
</span> <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C14V28">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">You heard how I told you, ‘I go away, and I come to you.’ If you loved me, you would have rejoiced, because
I said ‘I am going to my Father;’ for the Father is greater than I.
</span> <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C14V29">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Now I have told you before it happens so that, when it happens, you may believe.
</span> <span class="verse"> 30</span><a name="C14V30">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">I will no more speak much with you, for the prince of the world comes, and he has nothing in me.
</span> <span class="verse"> 31</span><a name="C14V31">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">But that the world may know that I love the Father, and as the Father commanded me, even so I do. Arise,
let us go from here.</span></div>
