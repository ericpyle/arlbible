 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C3V1">&nbsp;</a>See how great a love the Father has given to us, that we should be called children of God! For this cause
the world doesn’t know us, because it didn’t know him.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C3V2">&nbsp;</a>Beloved, now we are children of God, and it is not yet revealed what we will be. But we know that, when
he is revealed, we will be like him; for we will see him just as he is.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C3V3">&nbsp;</a>Everyone who has this hope set on him purifies himself, even as he is pure.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C3V4">&nbsp;</a>Everyone who sins also commits lawlessness. Sin is lawlessness.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C3V5">&nbsp;</a>You know that he was revealed to take away our sins, and in him is no sin.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C3V6">&nbsp;</a>Whoever remains in him doesn’t sin. Whoever sins hasn’t seen him and doesn’t know him.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C3V7">&nbsp;</a>Little children, let no one lead you astray. He who does righteousness is righteous, even as he is righteous.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C3V8">&nbsp;</a>He who sins is of the devil, for the devil has been sinning from the beginning. To this end the Son of
God was revealed: that he might destroy the works of the devil.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C3V9">&nbsp;</a>Whoever is born of God doesn’t commit sin, because his seed remains in him; and he can’t sin, because
he is born of God.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C3V10">&nbsp;</a>In this the children of God are revealed, and the children of the devil. Whoever doesn’t do righteousness
is not of God, neither is he who doesn’t love his brother.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C3V11">&nbsp;</a>For this is the message which you heard from the beginning, that we should love one another;
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C3V12">&nbsp;</a>unlike Cain, who was of the evil one, and killed his brother. Why did he kill him? Because his deeds
were evil, and his brother’s righteous.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C3V13">&nbsp;</a>Don’t be surprised, my brothers, if the world hates you.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C3V14">&nbsp;</a>We know that we have passed out of death into life, because we love the brothers. He who doesn’t love
his brother remains in death.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C3V15">&nbsp;</a>Whoever hates his brother is a murderer, and you know that no murderer has eternal life remaining in
him.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C3V16">&nbsp;</a>By this we know love, because he laid down his life for us. And we ought to lay down our lives for the
brothers.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C3V17">&nbsp;</a>But whoever has the world’s goods, and sees his brother in need, and closes his heart of compassion against
him, how does God’s love remain in him?
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C3V18">&nbsp;</a>My little children, let’s not love in word only, or with the tongue only, but in deed and truth.
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C3V19">&nbsp;</a>And by this we know that we are of the truth, and persuade our hearts before him,
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C3V20">&nbsp;</a>because if our heart condemns us, God is greater than our heart, and knows all things.
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C3V21">&nbsp;</a>Beloved, if our hearts don’t condemn us, we have boldness toward God;
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C3V22">&nbsp;</a>and whatever we ask, we receive from him, because we keep his commandments and do the things that are
pleasing in his sight.
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C3V23">&nbsp;</a>This is his commandment, that we should believe in the name of his Son, Jesus Christ, and love one another,
even as he commanded.
 <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C3V24">&nbsp;</a>He who keeps his commandments remains in him, and he in him. By this we know that he remains in us, by
the Spirit which he gave us.
