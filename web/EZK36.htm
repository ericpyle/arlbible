 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C36V1">&nbsp;</a>You, son of man, prophesy to the mountains of Israel, and say, “You mountains of Israel, hear Yahweh’s
word.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C36V2">&nbsp;</a>Thus says the Lord Yahweh: ‘Because the enemy has said against you, “Aha!” and, “The ancient high places
are ours in possession;”’
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C36V3">&nbsp;</a>therefore prophesy, and say, ‘Thus says the Lord Yahweh: “Because, even because they have made you desolate,
and swallowed you up on every side, that you might be a possession to the residue of the nations, and
you are taken up in the lips of talkers, and the evil report of the people;”
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C36V4">&nbsp;</a>therefore, you mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord Yahweh: Thus says the Lord Yahweh to the
mountains and to the hills, to the watercourses and to the valleys, to the desolate wastes and to the
cities that are forsaken, which are become a prey and derision to the residue of the nations that are
all around;
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C36V5">&nbsp;</a>therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh: “Surely in the fire of my jealousy I have spoken against the residue
of the nations, and against all Edom, that have appointed my land to themselves for a possession with
the joy of all their heart, with despite of soul, to cast it out for a prey.”’
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C36V6">&nbsp;</a>Therefore prophesy concerning the land of Israel, and tell the mountains and to the hills, to the watercourses
and to the valleys, ‘Thus says the Lord Yahweh: “Behold, I have spoken in my jealousy and in my wrath,
because you have borne the shame of the nations.”
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C36V7">&nbsp;</a>therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh: “I have sworn, ‘Surely the nations that are around you will bear
their shame.’
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C36V8">&nbsp;</a>“‘“But you, mountains of Israel, you shall shoot out your branches, and yield your fruit to my people
Israel; for they are at hand to come.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C36V9">&nbsp;</a>For, behold, I am for you, and I will turn into you, and you will be tilled and sown;
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C36V10">&nbsp;</a>and I will multiply men on you, all the house of Israel, even all of it; and the cities will be inhabited,
and the waste places will be built;
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C36V11">&nbsp;</a>and I will multiply on you man and animal; and they will increase and be fruitful. I will cause you to
be inhabited after your former estate, and you will do better than at your beginnings. Then you will
know that I am Yahweh.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C36V12">&nbsp;</a>Yes, I will cause men to walk on you, even my people Israel; and they will possess you, and you will
be their inheritance, and you will no more henceforth bereave them of children.”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C36V13">&nbsp;</a>“‘Thus says the Lord Yahweh: “Because they say to you, ‘You are a devourer of men, and have been a bereaver
of your nation;’
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C36V14">&nbsp;</a>therefore you shall devour men no more, neither bereave your nation any more,” says the Lord Yahweh;
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C36V15">&nbsp;</a>“neither will I let you hear any more the shame of the nations, neither will you bear the reproach of
the peoples any more, neither will you cause your nation to stumble any more,” says the Lord Yahweh.’”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C36V16">&nbsp;</a>Moreover Yahweh’s word came to me, saying,
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C36V17">&nbsp;</a>“Son of man, when the house of Israel lived in their own land, they defiled it by their way and by their
doings. Their way before me was as the uncleanness of a woman in her impurity.
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C36V18">&nbsp;</a>Therefore I poured out my wrath on them for the blood which they had poured out on the land, and because
they had defiled it with their idols;
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C36V19">&nbsp;</a>and I scattered them among the nations, and they were dispersed through the countries. According to their
way and according to their doings I judged them.
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C36V20">&nbsp;</a>When they came to the nations, where they went, they profaned my holy name; in that men said of them,
‘These are the people of Yahweh, and have gone out of his land.’
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C36V21">&nbsp;</a>But I had respect for my holy name, which the house of Israel had profaned among the nations, where they
went.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C36V22">&nbsp;</a>“Therefore tell the house of Israel, ‘Thus says the Lord Yahweh: “I don’t do this for your sake, house
of Israel, but for my holy name, which you have profaned among the nations, where you went.
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C36V23">&nbsp;</a>I will sanctify my great name, which has been profaned among the nations, which you have profaned among
them. Then the nations will know that I am Yahweh,” says the Lord Yahweh, “when I am sanctified in you
before their eyes.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C36V24">&nbsp;</a>“‘“For I will take you from among the nations, and gather you out of all the countries, and will bring
you into your own land.
 <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C36V25">&nbsp;</a>I will sprinkle clean water on you, and you will be clean. I will cleanse you from all your filthiness,
and from all your idols.
 <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C36V26">&nbsp;</a>I will also give you a new heart, and I will put a new spirit within you; and I will take away the stony
heart out of your flesh, and I will give you a heart of flesh.
 <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C36V27">&nbsp;</a>I will put my Spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my statutes, and you will keep my ordinances,
and do them.
 <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C36V28">&nbsp;</a>You will dwell in the land that I gave to your fathers; and you will be my people, and I will be your
God.
 <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C36V29">&nbsp;</a>I will save you from all your uncleanness: and I will call for the grain, and will multiply it, and lay
no famine on you.
 <span class="verse"> 30</span><a name="C36V30">&nbsp;</a>I will multiply the fruit of the tree, and the increase of the field, that you may receive no more the
reproach of famine among the nations.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 31</span><a name="C36V31">&nbsp;</a>“‘“Then you will remember your evil ways, and your doings that were not good; and you will loathe yourselves
in your own sight for your iniquities and for your abominations.
 <span class="verse"> 32</span><a name="C36V32">&nbsp;</a>Nor for your sake do I this,” says the Lord Yahweh, “be it known to you: be ashamed and confounded for
your ways, house of Israel.”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 33</span><a name="C36V33">&nbsp;</a>“‘Thus says the Lord Yahweh: “In the day that I cleanse you from all your iniquities, I will cause the
cities to be inhabited, and the waste places will be built.
 <span class="verse"> 34</span><a name="C36V34">&nbsp;</a>The land that was desolate will be tilled, whereas it was a desolation in the sight of all who passed
by.
 <span class="verse"> 35</span><a name="C36V35">&nbsp;</a>They will say, ‘This land that was desolate has become like the garden of Eden; and the waste and desolate
and ruined cities are fortified and inhabited.’
 <span class="verse"> 36</span><a name="C36V36">&nbsp;</a>Then the nations that are left around you will know that I, Yahweh, have built the ruined places, and
planted that which was desolate: I, Yahweh, have spoken it, and I will do it.”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 37</span><a name="C36V37">&nbsp;</a>“‘Thus says the Lord Yahweh: “For this, moreover, will I be inquired of by the house of Israel, to do
it for them: I will increase them with men like a flock.
 <span class="verse"> 38</span><a name="C36V38">&nbsp;</a>As the flock for sacrifice, as the flock of Jerusalem in her appointed feasts, so the waste cities will
be filled with flocks of men. Then they will know that I am Yahweh.’”
