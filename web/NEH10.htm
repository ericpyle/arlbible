God’s law, which was given by Moses the servant of God, and to observe and do all the commandments of
Yahweh our Lord, and his ordinances and his statutes;
 <span class="verse"> 30</span><a name="C10V30">&nbsp;</a>and that we would not give our daughters to the peoples of the land, nor take their daughters for our
sons;

buy from them on the Sabbath, or on a holy day; and that we would forego the seventh year, and the exaction
of every debt.

<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 32</span><a name="C10V32">&nbsp;</a>Also we made ordinances for ourselves, to charge ourselves yearly with the third part of a shekel<a href="#FN1"><span class="notemark">*</span><span class="popup">A shekel is about 10 grams or about 0.35 ounces.</span></a>
 for the service of the house of our God;

for the new moons, for the set feasts, and for the holy things, and for the sin offerings to make atonement
for Israel, and for all the work of the house of our God.
 <span class="verse"> 34</span><a name="C10V34">&nbsp;</a>We cast lots, the priests, the Levites, and the people, for the wood offering, to bring it into the house
of our God, according to our fathers’ houses, at times appointed, year by year, to burn on Yahweh our
God’s altar, as it is written in the law;
 <span class="verse"> 35</span><a name="C10V35">&nbsp;</a>and to bring the first fruits of our ground, and the first fruits of all fruit of all kinds of trees,
year by year, to Yahweh’s house;
 <span class="verse"> 36</span><a name="C10V36">&nbsp;</a>also the firstborn of our sons, and of our livestock, as it is written in the law, and the firstborn
of our herds and of our flocks, to bring to the house of our God, to the priests who minister in the
house of our God;
 <span class="verse"> 37</span><a name="C10V37">&nbsp;</a>and that we should bring the first fruits of our dough, our wave offerings, the fruit of all kinds of
trees, and the new wine and the oil, to the priests, to the rooms of the house of our God; and the tithes
of our ground to the Levites; for they, the Levites, take the tithes in all the cities of our tillage.
 <span class="verse"> 38</span><a name="C10V38">&nbsp;</a>The priest the son of Aaron shall be with the Levites, when the Levites take tithes. The Levites shall
bring up the tithe of the tithes to the house of our God, to the rooms, into the treasure house.

with the gatekeepers and the singers. We will not forsake the house of our God.
