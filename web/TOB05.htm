 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C5V1">&nbsp;</a>And Tobias answered and said to him, Father, I will do all things, whatever you have commanded me:
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C5V2">&nbsp;</a>but how shall I be able to receive the money, seeing I know him not?
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C5V3">&nbsp;</a>And he gave him the handwriting, and said to him, Seek you a man which shall go with you, and I will
give him wages, whiles I yet live: and go and receive the money.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C5V4">&nbsp;</a>And he went to seek a man, and found Raphael which was an angel;
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C5V5">&nbsp;</a>and he knew it not; and he said to him, Can I go with you to Rages of Media? and know you the places
well?
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C5V6">&nbsp;</a>And the angel said to him, I will go with you, and I know the way well: and I have lodged with our brother
Gabael.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C5V7">&nbsp;</a>And Tobias said to him, Wait for me, and I will tell my father.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C5V8">&nbsp;</a>And he said to him, Go, and wait not. And he went in and said to his father, Behold, I have found one
which will go with me. But he said, Call him to me, that I may know of what tribe he is, and whether
he be a trusty man to go with you.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C5V9">&nbsp;</a>And he called him, and he came in, and they saluted one another.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C5V10">&nbsp;</a>And Tobit said to him, Brother, of what tribe and of what family are you? Show me.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C5V11">&nbsp;</a>And he said to him, Seek you a tribe and a family, or a hired man which shall go with your son? And Tobit
said to him, I would know, brother, your kindred and your name.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C5V12">&nbsp;</a>And he said, I am Azarias, the son of Ananias the great, of your brethren.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C5V13">&nbsp;</a>And he said to him, Welcome, brother; and be not angry with me, because I sought to know your tribe and
family: and you are my brother, of an honest and good lineage: for I knew Ananias and Jathan, the sons
of Shemaiah the great, when we went together to Jerusalem to worship, and offered the firstborn, and
the tenths of our increase; and they went not astray in the error of our brethren: my brother, you are
of a great stock.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C5V14">&nbsp;</a>But tell me, what wages shall I give you? a drachma a day, and those things that be necessary for you,
as to my son?
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C5V15">&nbsp;</a>And moreover, if you⌃ return safe and sound, I will add something to your wages.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C5V16">&nbsp;</a>And so they consented. And he said to Tobias, Prepare yourself for the journey, and God prosper you.
And his son prepared what was needful for the journey, and his father said to him, Go you with this man;
but God, which dwells in heaven, shall prosper your journey; and may his angel go with you. And they
both went forth to depart, and the young man’s dog with them.

<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C5V17">&nbsp;</a>But Anna his mother wept, and said to Tobit, Why have you sent away our child? is he not the staff of
our hand, in going in and out before us?
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C5V18">&nbsp;</a>Be not greedy to add money to money: but let it be as refuse in respect of our child.
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C5V19">&nbsp;</a>For as the Lord has given us to live, so does it suffice us.
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C5V20">&nbsp;</a>And Tobit said to her, Take no care, my sister; he shall return safe and sound, and your eyes shall see
him.
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C5V21">&nbsp;</a>For a good angel shall go with him, and his journey shall be prospered, and he shall return safe and
sound.
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C5V22">&nbsp;</a>And she made an end of weeping.
