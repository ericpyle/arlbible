 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C6V1">&nbsp;</a>Now in those days, when the number of the disciples was multiplying, a complaint arose from the Hellenists<a href="#FN1"><span class="notemark">*</span><span class="popup">The Hellenists used Greek language and culture, even though they were also of Hebrew descent.</span></a>
 against the Hebrews, because their widows were neglected in the daily service.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C6V2">&nbsp;</a>The twelve summoned the multitude of the disciples and said, “It is not appropriate for us to forsake
the word of God and serve tables.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C6V3">&nbsp;</a>Therefore select from among you, brothers, seven men of good report, full of the Holy Spirit and of wisdom,
whom we may appoint over this business.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C6V4">&nbsp;</a>But we will continue steadfastly in prayer and in the ministry of the word.”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C6V5">&nbsp;</a>These words pleased the whole multitude. They chose Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Spirit,
Philip, Prochorus, Nicanor, Timon, Parmenas, and Nicolaus, a proselyte of Antioch;
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C6V6">&nbsp;</a>whom they set before the apostles. When they had prayed, they laid their hands on them.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C6V7">&nbsp;</a>The word of God increased and the number of the disciples multiplied in Jerusalem exceedingly. A great
company of the priests were obedient to the faith.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C6V8">&nbsp;</a>Stephen, full of faith and power, performed great wonders and signs among the people.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C6V9">&nbsp;</a>But some of those who were of the synagogue called “The Libertines”, and of the Cyrenians, of the Alexandrians,
and of those of Cilicia and Asia arose, disputing with Stephen.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C6V10">&nbsp;</a>They weren’t able to withstand the wisdom and the Spirit by which he spoke.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C6V11">&nbsp;</a>Then they secretly induced men to say, “We have heard him speak blasphemous words against Moses and God.”
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C6V12">&nbsp;</a>They stirred up the people, the elders, and the scribes, and came against him and seized him, and brought
him in to the council,
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C6V13">&nbsp;</a>and set up false witnesses who said, “This man never stops speaking blasphemous words against this holy
place and the law.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C6V14">&nbsp;</a>For we have heard him say that this Jesus of Nazareth will destroy this place, and will change the customs
which Moses delivered to us.”
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C6V15">&nbsp;</a>All who sat in the council, fastening their eyes on him, saw his face like it was the face of an angel.
