 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C6V1">&nbsp;</a>And he said to me, In the beginning, when the earth was made, before the outgoings of the world were
fixed, or ever the gatherings of the winds blew,
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C6V2">&nbsp;</a>before the voices of the thunder sounded and before the flashes of the lightning shone, or ever the foundations
of paradise were laid,
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C6V3">&nbsp;</a>before the fair flowers were seen, or ever the powers of the earthquake were established, before the
innumerable hosts of angels were gathered together,
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C6V4">&nbsp;</a>or ever the heights of the air were lifted up, before the measures of the firmament were named, or ever
the footstool of Sion

 was established,
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C6V5">&nbsp;</a>and ere the present years were sought out, and or ever the imaginations of them that now sin were estranged,
before they were sealed that have gathered faith for a treasure:
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C6V6">&nbsp;</a>then did I consider these things, and they all were made through me alone, and through none other: as
by me also they shall be ended, and by none other.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C6V7">&nbsp;</a>Then answered I and said, what shall be the parting asunder of the times? or when shall be the end of
the first, and the beginning of it that follows?
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C6V8">&nbsp;</a>And he said to me, From

</span></a>
 Abraham to
<a href="#FN3"><span class="notemark">‡</span><span class="popup">Another reading is,

</span></a>
 Abraham, inasmuch as Jacob and Esau were born of him, for Jacob’s hand held the heel of Esau from the
beginning.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C6V9">&nbsp;</a>For Esau is the end of this world, and Jacob is the beginning of it that follows.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C6V10">&nbsp;</a><a href="#FN4"><span class="notemark">§</span><span class="popup">So the Syriac, etc. The Latin is defective.
</span></a>
 The beginning of a man is his hand, and the end of a man is his heel; between the heel and the hand
seek you nothing else, Esdras.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C6V11">&nbsp;</a>I answered then and said, O Lord that bear rule, If I have found favor in your sight,
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C6V12">&nbsp;</a>I beseech you, show your servant the end of your tokens, whereof you showed me part the last night.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C6V13">&nbsp;</a>So he answered and said to me, Stand up upon your feet, and you shall hear a mighty sounding voice;
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C6V14">&nbsp;</a>and if the place whereon you stand be greatly moved,
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C6V15">&nbsp;</a>when it speaks be you not afraid: for the word is of the end, and the foundations of the earth shall
understand,
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C6V16">&nbsp;</a>that the speech is of them: they shall tremble and be moved: for they know that their end must be changed.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C6V17">&nbsp;</a>And it happened, that when I had heard it I stood up upon my feet, and hearkened, and, behold, there
was a voice that spoke, and the sound of it was like the sound of many waters.
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C6V18">&nbsp;</a>And it said, Behold, the days come, and it shall be that when I draw near to visit them that dwell upon
the earth,
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C6V19">&nbsp;</a>and when I shall make inquisition of them that have done hurt unjustly with their unrighteousness, and
when the affliction of Sion shall be fulfilled,
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C6V20">&nbsp;</a>and when the seal shall be set upon the world that is to pass away, then will I show these tokens: the
books shall be opened before the firmament, and all shall see together:
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C6V21">&nbsp;</a>and the children of a year old shall speak with their voices, the women with child shall bring forth
untimely children at three or four months, and they shall live, and dance.
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C6V22">&nbsp;</a>And suddenly shall the sown places appear unsown, the full storehouses shall suddenly be found empty:
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C6V23">&nbsp;</a>and the trumpet shall give a sound, which when every man hears, they shall be suddenly afraid.
 <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C6V24">&nbsp;</a>At that time shall friends make war one against another like enemies, and the earth shall stand in fear
with those that dwell therein, the springs of the fountains shall stand still, so that for three hours
they shall not run.
 <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C6V25">&nbsp;</a>And it shall be that whoever remains after all these things that I have told you of, he shall be saved,
and shall see my salvation, and the end of my world.
 <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C6V26">&nbsp;</a>And they shall see the men that have been taken up, who have not tasted death from their birth: and the
heart of the inhabitants shall be changed, and turned into another meaning.
 <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C6V27">&nbsp;</a>For evil shall be blotted out, and deceit shall be quenched;
 <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C6V28">&nbsp;</a>and faith shall flourish, and corruption shall be overcome, and the truth, which has been so long without
fruit, shall be declared.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C6V29">&nbsp;</a>And when he talked with me, behold, by little and little the place whereon I stood
<a href="#FN5"><span class="notemark">**</span><span class="popup">After the Oriental versions. The Latin is corrupt.
</span></a>
 rocked to and fro.
 <span class="verse"> 30</span><a name="C6V30">&nbsp;</a>And he said to me, These things came I to show you

</span></a>
 this night.
 <span class="verse"> 31</span><a name="C6V31">&nbsp;</a>If therefore you will pray yet again, and fast seven days more, I shall yet

</span></a>
 tell you greater things than these.
 <span class="verse"> 32</span><a name="C6V32">&nbsp;</a>For your voice has surely been heard before the Most High: for the Mighty has seen your righteous dealing,
he has seen aforetime also your chastity, which you have had ever since your youth.
 <span class="verse"> 33</span><a name="C6V33">&nbsp;</a>And therefore has he sent me to show you all these things, and to say to you, Be of good comfort, and
fear not.
 <span class="verse"> 34</span><a name="C6V34">&nbsp;</a>And be not hasty in
<span class="add">regard of
</span> the former times, to think vain things, that you may not hasten in the latter times.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 35</span><a name="C6V35">&nbsp;</a>And it came to pass after this, that I wept again, and fasted seven days in like manner, that I might
fulfil the three weeks which he told me.
 <span class="verse"> 36</span><a name="C6V36">&nbsp;</a>And in the eighth night was my heart vexed within me again, and I began to speak before the Most High.
 <span class="verse"> 37</span><a name="C6V37">&nbsp;</a>For my spirit was greatly set on fire, and my soul was in distress.
 <span class="verse"> 38</span><a name="C6V38">&nbsp;</a>And I said, O Lord, of a truth you spoke at the beginning of the creation, upon the first day, and said
thus; Let heaven and earth be made; and your word perfected the work.
 <span class="verse"> 39</span><a name="C6V39">&nbsp;</a>And then was the spirit hovering, and darkness and silence were on every side; the sound of man’s voice
was not yet.<a href="#FN8"><span class="notemark">§§</span><span class="popup">The Latin adds
from you.</span></a>
 <span class="verse"> 40</span><a name="C6V40">&nbsp;</a>Then command you a ray of light to be brought forth of your treasures, that then your works might appear.
 <span class="verse"> 41</span><a name="C6V41">&nbsp;</a>Upon the second day again you made the spirit of the firmament and commanded it to part asunder, and
to make a division between the waters, that the one part might go up, and the other remain beneath.
 <span class="verse"> 42</span><a name="C6V42">&nbsp;</a>Upon the third day you did command that the waters should be gathered together in the seventh part of
the earth: six parts did you dry up, and keep them, to the intent that of these some being both planted
and tilled might serve before you.
 <span class="verse"> 43</span><a name="C6V43">&nbsp;</a>For as soom as your word went forth the work was done.
 <span class="verse"> 44</span><a name="C6V44">&nbsp;</a>For immediately there came forth great and innumerable fruit, and manifold pleasures for the taste, and
flowers of inimitable color, and odors of most exquisite smell: and this was done the third day.
 <span class="verse"> 45</span><a name="C6V45">&nbsp;</a>Upon the fourth day you commanded that the sun should shine, and the moon give her light, and the stars
should be in their order:
 <span class="verse"> 46</span><a name="C6V46">&nbsp;</a>and gave them a charge to do service to man, that was to be made.
 <span class="verse"> 47</span><a name="C6V47">&nbsp;</a>Upon the fifth day you said to the seventh part, where the water was gathered together, that it should
bring forth living creatures, fowls and fishes: and so it came to pass,
 <span class="verse"> 48</span><a name="C6V48">&nbsp;</a>that the dumb water and without life brought forth living things as it was bidden, that the peoples might
therefore praise your wondrous works.
 <span class="verse"> 49</span><a name="C6V49">&nbsp;</a>Then did you preserve two living creatures, the one you calledst Behemoth, and the other you calledst
Leviathan:
 <span class="verse"> 50</span><a name="C6V50">&nbsp;</a>and you did separate the one from the other: for the seventh part, namely, where the water was gathered
together, might not hold them both.
 <span class="verse"> 51</span><a name="C6V51">&nbsp;</a>To Behemoth you gave one part, which was dried up on the third day, that he should dwell in the same,
wherein are a thousand hills:
 <span class="verse"> 52</span><a name="C6V52">&nbsp;</a>but to Leviathan you gave the seventh part, namely, the moist; and you have kept them to be devoured
of whom you will, and when.
 <span class="verse"> 53</span><a name="C6V53">&nbsp;</a>But upon the sixth day you gave commandment to the earth, that it should bring forth before you cattle,
beasts, and creeping things:
 <span class="verse"> 54</span><a name="C6V54">&nbsp;</a>and over these Adam, whom you ordain lord over all the works that you have made: of him come we all,
the people whom you have chosen.
 <span class="verse"> 55</span><a name="C6V55">&nbsp;</a>All this have I spoken before you, O Lord, because you have said that for our sakes you made

</span></a>
 this world.
 <span class="verse"> 56</span><a name="C6V56">&nbsp;</a>As for the other nations, which also come of Adam, you have said that they are nothing, and are like
to spittle: and you have likened the abundance of them to a drop that falls from a vessel.
 <span class="verse"> 57</span><a name="C6V57">&nbsp;</a>And now, O Lord, behold these nations, which are reputed as nothing, be lords over us, and devour us.
 <span class="verse"> 58</span><a name="C6V58">&nbsp;</a>But we your people, whom you have called your firstborn, your only begotten, and your fervent lover,
are given into their hands.
 <span class="verse"> 59</span><a name="C6V59">&nbsp;</a>If the world now be made for our sakes, why do we not possess for an inheritance our world? How long
shall this endure?
