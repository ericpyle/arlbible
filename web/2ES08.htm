<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 42</span><a name="C8V42">&nbsp;</a>I answered then and said, if I have found favor, let me speak before you.

shall be hereafter.
 <span class="verse"> 47</span><a name="C8V47">&nbsp;</a>For you come far short that you should be able to love my creature more than I. But you have brought
yourself full near to the unrighteous.
<span class="add">Let this

 [death] is hidden; hell and corruption are fled into forgetfulness:
 <span class="verse"> 54</span><a name="C8V54">&nbsp;</a>sorrows are passed away, and in the end is showed the treasure of immortality.
 <span class="verse"> 55</span><a name="C8V55">&nbsp;</a>Therefore ask you no more questions concerning the multitude of them that perish.
 <span class="verse"> 56</span><a name="C8V56">&nbsp;</a>For when they had received liberty, they despised the Most High, thought scorn of his law, and forsook
his ways.
 <span class="verse"> 57</span><a name="C8V57">&nbsp;</a>Moreover they have trodden down his righteous,
 <span class="verse"> 58</span><a name="C8V58">&nbsp;</a>and said in their heart, that there is no God; yes, and that knowing they must die.
 <span class="verse"> 59</span><a name="C8V59">&nbsp;</a>For as the things aforesaid shall receive you, so thirst and pain which are prepared
<span class="add">shall receive
</span> them: for the Most High willed not that men should come to nothing:
 <span class="verse"> 60</span><a name="C8V60">&nbsp;</a>but they which be created have themselves defiled the name of him that made them, and were unthankful
to him which prepared life for them.
 <span class="verse"> 61</span><a name="C8V61">&nbsp;</a>And therefore is my judgement now at hand,
