 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C9V1">&nbsp;</a>Now about that time it befell that Antiochus had returned
<a href="#FN1"><span class="notemark">*</span><span class="popup">Or,
with dishonor
</span></a>
 in disorder from the region of Persia.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C9V2">&nbsp;</a>For he had entered into the city called Persepolis, and he assayed to rob
<a href="#FN2"><span class="notemark">†</span><span class="popup">Or,
temples
</span></a>
 a temple and to hold down the city. Whereupon there was an onset of the multitudes, and
<a href="#FN3"><span class="notemark">‡</span><span class="popup">Or, the people of the country
turned
</span></a>
<span class="add">Antiochus and his men
</span> turned to make defence with arms; and it came to pass that Antiochus was put to flight by the people
of the country and broke up his camp with disgrace.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C9V3">&nbsp;</a>And while he was at Ecbatana, news was brought him what had happened to Nicanor and the forces of Timotheus.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C9V4">&nbsp;</a>And being lifted up
<a href="#FN4"><span class="notemark">§</span><span class="popup">Or,
in his spirit
</span></a>
 by his passion he thought to make the Jews suffer even for the evil-doing of those that had put him
to rout. Wherefore, the judgement from heaven even now accompanying him, he gave order to his charioteer
to drive without ceasing and despatch the journey; for thus he arrogantly spoke: I will make Jerusalem
a common graveyard of Jews, when I come there.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C9V5">&nbsp;</a>But the All-seeing Lord, the God of Israel, struck him with a
<a href="#FN5"><span class="notemark">**</span><span class="popup">Gr.
remediless.
</span></a>
 fatal and invisible stroke; and as soon as he had ceased speaking this word, an incurable pain of the
bowels seized him, and bitter torments of the inner parts;
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C9V6">&nbsp;</a>and that most justly, for he had tormented other men’s bowels with many and strange sufferings.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C9V7">&nbsp;</a>But he in no wise ceased from his rude insolence; nay, still more was he filled with arrogancy, breathing
fire in his passion against the Jews, and commanding to haste the journey. But it came to pass moreover
that he fell from his chariot as it rushed along, and having a grievous fall was racked in all the members
of his body.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C9V8">&nbsp;</a>And he that but now supposed himself to have the waves of the sea at his bidding, so vainglorious was
he beyond the condition of a man, and that thought to weigh the heights of the mountains in a balance,
was now brought to the ground and carried in a litter,
<a href="#FN6"><span class="notemark">††</span><span class="popup">Or,
showing manifestly to all the power of God
</span></a>
 showing to all that the power was manifestly God’s;
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C9V9">&nbsp;</a>so that out of the body of the impious man worms swarmed, and while he was still living in anguish and
pains, his flesh fell off, and by reason of the stench all the army turned with loathing from his corruption.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C9V10">&nbsp;</a>And the man that a little before supposed himself to touch the stars of heaven, no one could endure to
carry for his intolerable stench.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C9V11">&nbsp;</a>Hereupon therefore he began in great part to cease from his arrogancy, being broken
<span class="add">in spirit,
</span> and to come to knowledge under the scourge of God, his pains increasing every moment.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C9V12">&nbsp;</a>And when he himself could not abide his own smell, he said these words: It is right to be subject to
God, and that one who is mortal should not
<a href="#FN7"><span class="notemark">‡‡</span><span class="popup">Some authorities read
be minded as
if
equal to God.
</span></a>
 be minded arrogantly.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C9V13">&nbsp;</a>And the vile man vowed to the sovereign Lord, who now no more would have pity upon him, saying on this
wise:
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C9V14">&nbsp;</a>that the holy city, to the which he was going in haste, to lay it even with the ground and to
<a href="#FN8"><span class="notemark">§§</span><span class="popup">Gr.
build.
</span></a>
 make it a common graveyard, he would declare free;
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C9V15">&nbsp;</a>and as touching the Jews, whom he had decided not even to count worthy of burial, but to cast them out
to the beasts with their infants, for the birds to devour, he would make them all equal to citizens of
Athens;
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C9V16">&nbsp;</a>and the holy sanctuary, which before he had spoiled, he would adorn with goodliest offerings, and would
restore all the sacred vessels many times multiplied, and out of his own revenues would defray the charges
that were required for the sacrifices;
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C9V17">&nbsp;</a>and, beside all this, that he would become a Jew, and would visit every inhabited place, publishing abroad
the might of God.
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C9V18">&nbsp;</a>But when his sufferings did in no wise cease, for the judgement of God had come upon him in righteousness,
having given up all hope of himself, he wrote to the Jews the letter written below, having the nature
of a supplication, to this effect:
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C9V19">&nbsp;</a>To the worthy Jews, his fellow-citizens, Antiochus, king and general, wishes much joy and health and
prosperity.
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C9V20">&nbsp;</a><a href="#FN9"><span class="notemark">***</span><span class="popup">Or,
You⌃ fare well, and your children; and your affairs are to your mind.
The Greek text in verses 20 and 21 is uncertain.
</span></a>
 May you⌃ and your children fare well; and your affairs shall be to your mind. Having my hope in heaven,
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C9V21">&nbsp;</a>I remembered with affection your honor and good will
<span class="add">toward me.
</span> Returning out of the region of Persia, and being taken with a noisome sickness, I deemed it necessary
to take thought for the common safety of all,
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C9V22">&nbsp;</a>not despairing of myself, but having great hope to escape from the sickness.
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C9V23">&nbsp;</a>But considering that my father also, at what time he led an army into the upper country, appointed his
successor,
 <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C9V24">&nbsp;</a>to the end that, if anything fell out contrary to expectation, or if any unwelcome tidings were brought,
they
<span class="add">that remained
</span> in the country, knowing to whom the state had been left, might not be troubled;
 <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C9V25">&nbsp;</a>and, beside all this, observing how that the princes that are borderers and neighbors to my kingdom watch
opportunities, and look for the future event, I have appointed my son Antiochus
<span class="add">to be
</span> king, whom I often committed and commended to most of you, when I was hastening to the upper provinces;
and I have written to him what is written below.
 <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C9V26">&nbsp;</a>I exhort you therefore and beseech you, having in your remembrance the benefits done to you in common
and severally, to preserve each of you your present good will toward me and my son.
 <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C9V27">&nbsp;</a>For I am persuaded that he in gentleness and kindness will follow my purpose and treat you with indulgence.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C9V28">&nbsp;</a>So the murderer and blasphemer, having endured the sorest sufferings, even as he had dealt with other
men, ended his life among the mountains by a most piteous fate in a strange land.
 <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C9V29">&nbsp;</a>And Philip his foster-brother conveyed the body
<span class="add">home;
</span> and then, fearing the son of Antiochus, he betook himself to Ptolemy Philometor in Egypt.
