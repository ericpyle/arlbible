 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C11V1">&nbsp;</a>And the king of Egypt gathered together great forces, as the sand which is by the sea shore, and many
ships, and sought to make himself master of Alexander’s kingdom by deceit, and to add it to his own kingdom.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C11V2">&nbsp;</a>And he went forth into Syria with words of peace, and they of the cities opened to him, and met him;
For king Alexander’s commandment was that they should meet him, because he was his father in law.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C11V3">&nbsp;</a>Now as he entered into the cities of Ptolemais, he set his forces for a garrison in each city.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C11V4">&nbsp;</a>But when he came near to Azotus, they showed him the temple of Dagon burned with fire, and Azotus and
the suburbs thereof pulled down, and the bodies cast abroad, and them that had been burned, whom he burned
in the war, for they had made heaps of them in his way.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C11V5">&nbsp;</a>And they told the king what things Jonathan had done, that they might cast blame on him: and the king
held his peace.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C11V6">&nbsp;</a>And Jonathan met the king with pomp at Joppa, and they saluted one another, and they slept there.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C11V7">&nbsp;</a>And Jonathan went with the king as far as the river that is called Eleutherus, and returned to Jerusalem.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C11V8">&nbsp;</a>But king Ptolemy became master of the cities upon the sea coast, to Selucia which is by the sea, and
he devised evil devices concerning Alexander.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C11V9">&nbsp;</a>And he sent ambassadors to king Demetrius, saying, Come, let us make a covenant with one another, and
I will give you my daughter whom Alexander has, and you shall reign over your father’s kingdom;
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C11V10">&nbsp;</a>for I have repented that I gave my daughter to him, for he sought to kill me.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C11V11">&nbsp;</a>And he cast blame on him, because he coveted his kingdom.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C11V12">&nbsp;</a>And taking his daughter from him, he gave her to Demetrius, and was estranged from Alexander, and their
enmity was openly seen.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C11V13">&nbsp;</a>And Ptolemy entered into Antioch, and put on himself the diadem of Asia; and he put two diadems upon
his head, the diadem of Egypt and that of Asia.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C11V14">&nbsp;</a>But king Alexander was in Cilicia at that season, because they of those parts were in revolt.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C11V15">&nbsp;</a>And Alexander heard of it, and he came against him in war: and Ptolemy led forth
<span class="add">his host,
</span> and met him with a strong force, and put him to flight.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C11V16">&nbsp;</a>And Alexander fled into Arabia, that he might be sheltered there; but king Ptolemy was exalted.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C11V17">&nbsp;</a>And Zabdiel the Arabian took off Alexander’s head, and sent it to Ptolemy.
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C11V18">&nbsp;</a>And king Ptolemy died the third day after, and they that were in his strongholds were slain by them that
were in the strongholds.
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C11V19">&nbsp;</a>And Demetrius reigned in
<a href="#FN1"><span class="notemark">*</span><span class="popup">circa B.C 146.
</span></a>
 the hundred and threescore and seventh year.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C11V20">&nbsp;</a>In those days Jonathan gathered together them of Judaea, to take the citadel that was at Jerusalem: and
he made many engines of war against it.
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C11V21">&nbsp;</a>And certain that hated their own nation, men that transgressed the law, went to the king, and reported
to him that Jonathan was besieging the citadel.
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C11V22">&nbsp;</a>And he heard, and was angered; but when he heard it, he set forth immediately, and came to Ptolemais,
and wrote to Jonathan, that he should not besiege it, and that he should meet him and speak with him
at Ptolemais with all speed.
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C11V23">&nbsp;</a>But when Jonathan heard this, he commanded to besiege it
<span class="add">still:
</span> and he chose certain of the elders of Israel and of the priests, and put himself in peril,
 <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C11V24">&nbsp;</a>and taking silver and gold and raiment and various presents besides, went to Ptolemais to the king. And
he found favor in his sight.
 <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C11V25">&nbsp;</a>And certain lawless men of them that were of the nation made complaints against him,
 <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C11V26">&nbsp;</a>and the king did to him even as his predecessors had done to him, and exalted him in the sight of all
his
<a href="#FN2"><span class="notemark">†</span><span class="popup">See 1 Maccabees 2:18.
</span></a>
 Friends,
 <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C11V27">&nbsp;</a>and confirmed to him the high priesthood, and all the other honors that he had before, and gave him preeminence
among his
<a href="#FN3"><span class="notemark">‡</span><span class="popup">See 1 Maccabees 10:65.
</span></a>
 Chief Friends.
 <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C11V28">&nbsp;</a>And Jonathan requested of the king, that he would make Judaea free from tribute, and the three
<a href="#FN4"><span class="notemark">§</span><span class="popup">Gr.
toparchies
</span></a>
 provinces, and the country of Samaria; and promised him three hundred talents.
 <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C11V29">&nbsp;</a>And the king consented, and wrote letters to Jonathan concerning all these things after this manner:
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 30</span><a name="C11V30">&nbsp;</a>King Demetrius to his brother Jonathan, and to the nation of the Jews, greeting:
 <span class="verse"> 31</span><a name="C11V31">&nbsp;</a>The copy of the letter which we wrote to Lasthenes our kinsman concerning you, we have written also to
you, that you⌃ may see it.
 <span class="verse"> 32</span><a name="C11V32">&nbsp;</a>King Demetrius to Lasthenes his father, greeting:
 <span class="verse"> 33</span><a name="C11V33">&nbsp;</a>We have determined to do good to the nation of the Jews, who are our friends, and observe what is just
toward us, because of their good will toward us.
 <span class="verse"> 34</span><a name="C11V34">&nbsp;</a>We have confirmed therefore to them the borders of Judaea, and also the three governments of Aphaerema
and Lydda and Ramathaim (<span class="add">these
</span> were added to Judaea from the country of Samaria), and all things appertaining to them, for all such
as do sacrifice in Jerusalem, instead of the king’s dues which the king received of them yearly aforetime
from the produce of the earth and the fruits of trees.
 <span class="verse"> 35</span><a name="C11V35">&nbsp;</a>And as for the other things that pertain to us from henceforth, of the tenths and the tolls that pertain
to us, and the saltpits, and the crowns that pertain to us, all these we will bestow upon them.
 <span class="verse"> 36</span><a name="C11V36">&nbsp;</a>And not one of these things shall be annulled from this time forth and for ever.
 <span class="verse"> 37</span><a name="C11V37">&nbsp;</a>Now therefore be careful to make a copy of these things, and let it be given to Jonathan, and let it
be set up on the holy mount in a meet and conspicuous place.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 38</span><a name="C11V38">&nbsp;</a>And king Demetrius saw that the land was quiet before him, and that no resistance was made to him, and
he sent away all his forces, each man to his own place, except the foreign forces, which he had raised
from the isles of the Gentiles: and all the forces of his fathers hated him.
 <span class="verse"> 39</span><a name="C11V39">&nbsp;</a>Now Tryphon was of those who aforetime had been of Alexander’s part, and he saw that all the forces murmured
against Demetrius, and he went to Imalcue the Arabian, who was nourishing up Antiochus the young child
of Alexander,
 <span class="verse"> 40</span><a name="C11V40">&nbsp;</a>and pressed sore upon him that he should deliver him to him, that he might reign in his father’s stead:
and he told him all that Demetrius had done, and the hatred wherewith his forces hated him; and he abode
there many days.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 41</span><a name="C11V41">&nbsp;</a>And Jonathan sent to king Demetrius, that he should cast out of Jerusalem them of the citadel, and them
that were in the strongholds; for they fought against Israel continually.
 <span class="verse"> 42</span><a name="C11V42">&nbsp;</a>And Demetrius sent to Jonathan, saying, I will not only do this for you and your nation, but I will greatly
honor you and your nation, if I find fair occasion.
 <span class="verse"> 43</span><a name="C11V43">&nbsp;</a>Now therefore you shall do well, if you send me men who shall fight for me; for all my forces are revolted.
 <span class="verse"> 44</span><a name="C11V44">&nbsp;</a>And Jonathan sent him three thousand valiant men to Antioch: and they came to the king, and the king
was glad at their coming.
 <span class="verse"> 45</span><a name="C11V45">&nbsp;</a>And they of the city gathered themselves together into the midst of the city, to the number of a hundred
and twenty thousand men, and they were minded to kill the king.
 <span class="verse"> 46</span><a name="C11V46">&nbsp;</a>And the king fled into the court of the palace, and they of the city seized the passages of the city,
and began to fight.
 <span class="verse"> 47</span><a name="C11V47">&nbsp;</a>And the king called the Jews to help him, and they were gathered together to him all at once, and they
dispersed themselves in the city, and killed that day to the number of a hundred thousand.
 <span class="verse"> 48</span><a name="C11V48">&nbsp;</a>And they set the city on fire, and got many spoils that day, and saved the king.
 <span class="verse"> 49</span><a name="C11V49">&nbsp;</a>And they of the city saw that the Jews had made themselves masters of the city as they would, and they
waxed faint in their hearts, and they cried out to the king with supplication, saying,
 <span class="verse"> 50</span><a name="C11V50">&nbsp;</a>Give us your right hand, and let the Jews cease from fighting against us and the city.
 <span class="verse"> 51</span><a name="C11V51">&nbsp;</a>And they cast away their arms, and made peace; and the Jews were glorified in the sight of the king,
and before all that were in his kingdom; and they returned to Jerusalem, having many spoils.
 <span class="verse"> 52</span><a name="C11V52">&nbsp;</a>And king Demetrius sat on the throne of his kingdom, and the land was quiet before him.
 <span class="verse"> 53</span><a name="C11V53">&nbsp;</a>And he lied in all that he spoke, and estranged himself from Jonathan, and recompensed him not according
to the benefits with which he had recompensed him, and afflicted him exceedingly.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 54</span><a name="C11V54">&nbsp;</a>Now after this Tryphon returned, and with him the young child Antiochus; and he reigned, and put on a
diadem.
 <span class="verse"> 55</span><a name="C11V55">&nbsp;</a>And there were gathered to him all the forces which Demetrius had sent away with disgrace, and they fought
against him, and he fled and was put to the rout.
 <span class="verse"> 56</span><a name="C11V56">&nbsp;</a>And Tryphon took the elephants, and became master of Antioch.
 <span class="verse"> 57</span><a name="C11V57">&nbsp;</a>And the young Antiochus wrote to Jonathan, saying, I confirm to you the high priesthood, and appoint
you over the four governments, and to be one of the king’s
<a href="#FN5"><span class="notemark">**</span><span class="popup">See 1 Maccabees 2:18.
</span></a>
 Friends.
 <span class="verse"> 58</span><a name="C11V58">&nbsp;</a>And he sent to him golden vessels and furniture for the table, and gave him leave to drink in golden
vessels, and to be clothed in purple, and to have a golden buckle.
 <span class="verse"> 59</span><a name="C11V59">&nbsp;</a>And his brother Simon he made captain from the Ladder of Tyre to the borders of Egypt.
 <span class="verse"> 60</span><a name="C11V60">&nbsp;</a>And Jonathan went forth, and took his journey beyond the river and through the cities; and all the forces
of Syria gathered themselves to him for to be his confederates. And he came to Ascalon, and they of the
city met him honorably.
 <span class="verse"> 61</span><a name="C11V61">&nbsp;</a>And he departed thence to Gaza, and they of Gaza shut him out; and he laid siege to it, and burned the
suburbs thereof with fire, and spoiled them.
 <span class="verse"> 62</span><a name="C11V62">&nbsp;</a>And they of Gaza made request to Jonathan, and he gave them his right hand, and took the sons of their
princes for hostages, and sent them away to Jerusalem; and he passed through the country as far as Damascus.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 63</span><a name="C11V63">&nbsp;</a>And Jonathan heard that Demetrius’ princes were come to Kedesh, which is in Galilee, with a great host,
purposing to remove him from his office;
 <span class="verse"> 64</span><a name="C11V64">&nbsp;</a>and he went to meet them, but Simon his brother he left in the country.
 <span class="verse"> 65</span><a name="C11V65">&nbsp;</a>And Simon encamped against Bethsura, and fought against it many days, and shut it up:
 <span class="verse"> 66</span><a name="C11V66">&nbsp;</a>and they made request to him that he would give them his right hand, and he gave it to them; and he put
them out from thence, and took possession of the city, and set a garrison over it.
 <span class="verse"> 67</span><a name="C11V67">&nbsp;</a>And Jonathan and his army encamped at the water of Gennesareth, and early in the morning they got them
to the plain of Hazor.
 <span class="verse"> 68</span><a name="C11V68">&nbsp;</a>And, behold, an army of strangers met him in the plain, and they laid an ambush for him in the mountains,
but themselves met him face to face.
 <span class="verse"> 69</span><a name="C11V69">&nbsp;</a>But they that lay in ambush rose out of their places, and joined battle; and all they that were of Jonathan’s
side fled:
 <span class="verse"> 70</span><a name="C11V70">&nbsp;</a>not one of them was left, except Mattathias the son of Absalom, and Judas the son of Chalphi, captains
of the forces.
 <span class="verse"> 71</span><a name="C11V71">&nbsp;</a>And Jonathan tore his clothes, and put earth upon his head, and prayed.
 <span class="verse"> 72</span><a name="C11V72">&nbsp;</a>And he turned again to them in battle, and put them to the rout, and they fled.
 <span class="verse"> 73</span><a name="C11V73">&nbsp;</a>And they of his side that fled saw it, and returned to him, and pursued with him to Kedesh to their camp,
and they encamped there.
 <span class="verse"> 74</span><a name="C11V74">&nbsp;</a>And there fell of the strangers on that day about three thousand men: and Jonathan returned to Jerusalem.
