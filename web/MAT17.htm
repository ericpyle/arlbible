 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C17V1">&nbsp;</a>After six days, Jesus took with him Peter, James, and John his brother, and brought them up into a high
mountain by themselves.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C17V2">&nbsp;</a>He was transfigured before them. His face shone like the sun, and his garments became as white as the
light.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C17V3">&nbsp;</a>Behold, Moses and Elijah appeared to them talking with him.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C17V4">&nbsp;</a>Peter answered, and said to Jesus, “Lord, it is good for us to be here. If you want, let’s make three
tents here: one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C17V5">&nbsp;</a>While he was still speaking, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them. Behold, a voice came out of the
cloud, saying, “This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased. Listen to him.”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C17V6">&nbsp;</a>When the disciples heard it, they fell on their faces, and were very afraid.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C17V7">&nbsp;</a>Jesus came and touched them and said,
<span class="wj">“Get up, and don’t be afraid.”
</span> <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C17V8">&nbsp;</a>Lifting up their eyes, they saw no one, except Jesus alone.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C17V9">&nbsp;</a>As they were coming down from the mountain, Jesus commanded them, saying,
<span class="wj">“Don’t tell anyone what you saw, until the Son of Man has risen from the dead.”</span></div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C17V10">&nbsp;</a>His disciples asked him, saying, “Then why do the scribes say that Elijah must come first?”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C17V11">&nbsp;</a>Jesus answered them,
<span class="wj">“Elijah indeed comes first, and will restore all things,
</span> <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C17V12">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">but I tell you that Elijah has come already, and they didn’t recognize him, but did to him whatever they
wanted to. Even so the Son of Man will also suffer by them.”</span> <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C17V13">&nbsp;</a>Then the disciples understood that he spoke to them of John the Baptizer.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C17V14">&nbsp;</a>When they came to the multitude, a man came to him, kneeling down to him, and saying,
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C17V15">&nbsp;</a>“Lord, have mercy on my son, for he is epileptic, and suffers grievously; for he often falls into the
fire, and often into the water.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C17V16">&nbsp;</a>So I brought him to your disciples, and they could not cure him.”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C17V17">&nbsp;</a>Jesus answered,
<span class="wj">“Faithless and perverse generation! How long will I be with you? How long will I bear with you? Bring
him here to me.”</span> <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C17V18">&nbsp;</a>Jesus rebuked him, the demon went out of him, and the boy was cured from that hour.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C17V19">&nbsp;</a>Then the disciples came to Jesus privately, and said, “Why weren’t we able to cast it out?”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C17V20">&nbsp;</a>He said to them,
<span class="wj">“Because of your unbelief. For most certainly I tell you, if you have faith as a grain of mustard seed,
you will tell this mountain, ‘Move from here to there,’ and it will move; and nothing will be impossible
for you.
</span> <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C17V21">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">But this kind doesn’t go out except by prayer and fasting.”

</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C17V22">&nbsp;</a>While they were staying in Galilee, Jesus said to them,
<span class="wj">“The Son of Man is about to be delivered up into the hands of men,
</span> <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C17V23">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">and they will kill him, and the third day he will be raised up.”
</span></div>
<div class="p">They were exceedingly sorry.

 came to Peter, and said, “Doesn’t your teacher pay the didrachma?”
 <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C17V25">&nbsp;</a>He said, “Yes.”
</div>
<div class="p">When he came into the house, Jesus anticipated him, saying,
<span class="wj">“What do you think, Simon? From whom do the kings of the earth receive toll or tribute? From their children,
or from strangers?”</span></div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C17V26">&nbsp;</a>Peter said to him, “From strangers.”
</div>
<div class="p">Jesus said to him,
<span class="wj">“Therefore the children are exempt.

up. When you have opened its mouth, you will find a stater coin.</span><a href="#FN3"><span class="notemark">‡</span><span class="popup">A stater is a silver coin equivalent to four Attic or two Alexandrian drachmas, or a Jewish shekel: just
