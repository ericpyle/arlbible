 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C2V1">&nbsp;</a>Therefore you are without excuse, O man, whoever you are who judge. For in that which you judge another,
you condemn yourself. For you who judge practice the same things.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C2V2">&nbsp;</a>We know that the judgment of God is according to truth against those who practice such things.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C2V3">&nbsp;</a>Do you think this, O man who judges those who practice such things, and do the same, that you will escape
the judgment of God?
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C2V4">&nbsp;</a>Or do you despise the riches of his goodness, forbearance, and patience, not knowing that the goodness
of God leads you to repentance?
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C2V5">&nbsp;</a>But according to your hardness and unrepentant heart you are treasuring up for yourself wrath in the
day of wrath, revelation, and of the righteous judgment of God;
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C2V6">&nbsp;</a>who “will pay back to everyone according to their works:”<a href="#FN1"><span class="notemark"></span><span class="popup">+ Psalm 62:12; Proverbs 24:12</span></a>
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C2V7">&nbsp;</a>to those who by perseverance in well-doing seek for glory, honor, and incorruptibility, eternal life;
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C2V8">&nbsp;</a>but to those who are self-seeking, and don’t obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness, will be wrath
and indignation,
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C2V9">&nbsp;</a>oppression and anguish, on every soul of man who does evil, to the Jew first, and also to the Greek.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C2V10">&nbsp;</a>But glory, honor, and peace go to every man who does good, to the Jew first, and also to the Greek.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C2V11">&nbsp;</a>For there is no partiality with God.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C2V12">&nbsp;</a>For as many as have sinned without law will also perish without the law. As many as have sinned under
the law will be judged by the law.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C2V13">&nbsp;</a>For it isn’t the hearers of the law who are righteous before God, but the doers of the law will be justified
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C2V14">&nbsp;</a>(for when Gentiles who don’t have the law do by nature the things of the law, these, not having the law,
are a law to themselves,
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C2V15">&nbsp;</a>in that they show the work of the law written in their hearts, their conscience testifying with them,
and their thoughts among themselves accusing or else excusing them)
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C2V16">&nbsp;</a>in the day when God will judge the secrets of men, according to my Good News, by Jesus Christ.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C2V17">&nbsp;</a>Indeed you bear the name of a Jew, and rest on the law, and glory in God,
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C2V18">&nbsp;</a>and know his will, and approve the things that are excellent, being instructed out of the law,
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C2V19">&nbsp;</a>and are confident that you yourself are a guide of the blind, a light to those who are in darkness,
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C2V20">&nbsp;</a>a corrector of the foolish, a teacher of babies, having in the law the form of knowledge and of the truth.
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C2V21">&nbsp;</a>You therefore who teach another, don’t you teach yourself? You who preach that a man shouldn’t steal,
do you steal?
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C2V22">&nbsp;</a>You who say a man shouldn’t commit adultery. Do you commit adultery? You who abhor idols, do you rob
temples?
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C2V23">&nbsp;</a>You who glory in the law, through your disobedience of the law do you dishonor God?
 <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C2V24">&nbsp;</a>For “the name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles because of you,”
<a href="#FN2"><span class="notemark"></span><span class="popup">+ Isaiah 52:5; Ezekiel 36:22</span></a>
 just as it is written.
 <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C2V25">&nbsp;</a>For circumcision indeed profits, if you are a doer of the law, but if you are a transgressor of the law,
your circumcision has become uncircumcision.
 <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C2V26">&nbsp;</a>If therefore the uncircumcised keep the ordinances of the law, won’t his uncircumcision be accounted
as circumcision?
 <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C2V27">&nbsp;</a>Won’t the uncircumcision which is by nature, if it fulfills the law, judge you, who with the letter and
circumcision are a transgressor of the law?
 <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C2V28">&nbsp;</a>For he is not a Jew who is one outwardly, neither is that circumcision which is outward in the flesh;
 <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C2V29">&nbsp;</a>but he is a Jew who is one inwardly, and circumcision is that of the heart, in the spirit not in the
letter; whose praise is not from men, but from God.
