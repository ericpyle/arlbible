<div class="mt1">Paul’s Letter to Philemon
</div>
<div class="chapterlabel"> 1</div><div class="p">
 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C1V1">&nbsp;</a>Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and Timothy our brother, to Philemon, our beloved fellow worker,
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C1V2">&nbsp;</a>to the beloved Apphia, to Archippus, our fellow soldier, and to the assembly in your house:
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C1V3">&nbsp;</a>Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C1V4">&nbsp;</a>I thank my God always, making mention of you in my prayers,
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C1V5">&nbsp;</a>hearing of your love, and of the faith which you have toward the Lord Jesus, and toward all the saints;
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C1V6">&nbsp;</a>that the fellowship of your faith may become effective, in the knowledge of every good thing which is
in us in Christ Jesus.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C1V7">&nbsp;</a>For we have much joy and comfort in your love, because the hearts of the saints have been refreshed through
you, brother.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C1V8">&nbsp;</a>Therefore though I have all boldness in Christ to command you that which is appropriate,
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C1V9">&nbsp;</a>yet for love’s sake I rather beg, being such a one as Paul, the aged, but also a prisoner of Jesus Christ.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C1V10">&nbsp;</a>I beg you for my child, whom I have become the father of in my chains, Onesimus,
<a href="#FN1"><span class="notemark">*</span><span class="popup">Onesimus means “useful”.</span></a>
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C1V11">&nbsp;</a>who once was useless to you, but now is useful to you and to me.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C1V12">&nbsp;</a>I am sending him back. Therefore receive him, that is, my own heart,
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C1V13">&nbsp;</a>whom I desired to keep with me, that on your behalf he might serve me in my chains for the Good News.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C1V14">&nbsp;</a>But I was willing to do nothing without your consent, that your goodness would not be as of necessity,
but of free will.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C1V15">&nbsp;</a>For perhaps he was therefore separated from you for a while, that you would have him forever,
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C1V16">&nbsp;</a>no longer as a slave, but more than a slave, a beloved brother, especially to me, but how much rather
to you, both in the flesh and in the Lord.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C1V17">&nbsp;</a>If then you count me a partner, receive him as you would receive me.
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C1V18">&nbsp;</a>But if he has wronged you at all, or owes you anything, put that to my account.
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C1V19">&nbsp;</a>I, Paul, write this with my own hand: I will repay it (not to mention to you that you owe to me even
your own self besides).
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C1V20">&nbsp;</a>Yes, brother, let me have joy from you in the Lord. Refresh my heart in the Lord.
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C1V21">&nbsp;</a>Having confidence in your obedience, I write to you, knowing that you will do even beyond what I say.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C1V22">&nbsp;</a>Also, prepare a guest room for me, for I hope that through your prayers I will be restored to you.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C1V23">&nbsp;</a>Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus, greets you,
 <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C1V24">&nbsp;</a>as do Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, and Luke, my fellow workers.
 <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C1V25">&nbsp;</a>The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen.
