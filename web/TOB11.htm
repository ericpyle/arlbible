 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C11V1">&nbsp;</a>After these things Tobias also went his way, blessing God because he had prospered his journey; and he
blessed Raguel and Edna his wife. And he went on his way till they drew near to Nineveh.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C11V2">&nbsp;</a>And Raphael said to Tobias, Know you not, brother, how you did leave your father?
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C11V3">&nbsp;</a>Let us run forward before your wife, and prepare the house.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C11V4">&nbsp;</a>But take in your hand the gall of the fish. And they went their way, and the dog went after them.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C11V5">&nbsp;</a>And Anna sat looking about toward the way for her son.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C11V6">&nbsp;</a>And she espied him coming, and said to his father, Behold, your son comes, and the man that went with
him.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C11V7">&nbsp;</a>And Raphael said, I know, Tobias, that your father will open his eyes.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C11V8">&nbsp;</a>Do you therefore anoint his eyes with the gall, and being pricked therewith, he shall rub, and shall
make the white films to fall away, and he shall see you.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C11V9">&nbsp;</a>And Anna ran to him, and fell upon the neck of her son, and said to him, I have seen you, my child; from
henceforth I will die. And they wept both.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C11V10">&nbsp;</a>And Tobit went forth toward the door, and stumbled: but his son ran to him,
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C11V11">&nbsp;</a>and took hold of his father: and he struck the gall on his father’s eyes, saying, Be of good cheer, my
father.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C11V12">&nbsp;</a>But when his eyes began to hurt, he rubbed them;
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C11V13">&nbsp;</a>and the white films scaled away from the corners of his eyes; and he saw his son, and fell upon his neck.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C11V14">&nbsp;</a>And he wept, and said, Blessed are you, O God, and blessed is your name for ever, and blessed are all
your holy angels;
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C11V15">&nbsp;</a>for you did scourge, and did have mercy on me: behold, I see my son Tobias. And his son went in rejoicing,
and told his father the great things that had happened to him in Media.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C11V16">&nbsp;</a>And Tobit went out to meet his daughter in law at the gate of Nineveh, rejoicing, and blessing God: and
they which saw him go marveled, because he had received his sight.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C11V17">&nbsp;</a>And Tobit gave thanks before them, because God had showed mercy on him. And when Tobit came near to Sarah
his daughter in law, he blessed her, saying, Welcome, daughter: blessed is God which has brought you
to us, and
<span class="add">blessed are
</span> your father and your mother. And there was joy to all his brethren which were at Nineveh.
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C11V18">&nbsp;</a>And Achiacharus, and Nasbas his brother’s son, came:
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C11V19">&nbsp;</a>and Tobias’ wedding feast was kept seven days with great gladness.
