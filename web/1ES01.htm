 Josias held the passover in Jerusalem to his Lord, and offered the passover the fourteenth day of the
first month;
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C1V2">&nbsp;</a>having set the priests according to their daily courses, being arrayed in their vestments, in the temple
of the Lord.

 the temple-servants of Israel, that they should hallow themselves to the Lord, to set the holy ark of
the Lord in the house that King Solomon the son of David had built:
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C1V4">&nbsp;</a><span class="add">and said,</span> You⌃ shall no more have need to bear it upon your shoulders: now therefore serve the Lord your God,
and minister to his people Israel, and prepare you after your fathers’ houses and kindred,
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C1V5">&nbsp;</a>according to the writing of David king of Israel, and according to the magnificence of Solomon his son:
and standing in the holy place according to the several divisions of the families of you the Levites,
who

 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C1V6">&nbsp;</a>offer the passover in order, and make ready the sacrifices for your brethren, and keep the passover according
to the commandment of the Lord, which was given to Moses.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C1V7">&nbsp;</a>And to the people which were present Josias gave thirty thousand lambs and kids,
<span class="add">and</span> three thousand calves: these things were given of the king’s substance, according as he promised, to
the people, and to the priests and Levites.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C1V8">&nbsp;</a>And Helkias, and Zacharias, and
<a href="#FN3"><span class="notemark">†</span><span class="popup">Jehiel,

 Esyelus, the rulers of the temple, gave to the priests for the passover two thousand

<span class="add">and</span> three hundred calves.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C1V9">&nbsp;</a>And Jeconias, and Samaias and Nathanael his brother, and Sabias, and Ochielus, and Joram, captains over

 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C1V10">&nbsp;</a>And when these things were done, the priests and Levites, having the unleavened bread, stood in comely
order according to the kindred,
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C1V11">&nbsp;</a>and according to the several divisions by fathers’ houses, before the people, to offer to the Lord, as
it is written in the book of Moses: and thus
<span class="add">did they</span> in the morning.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C1V12">&nbsp;</a>And they roasted the passover with fire, as appertains: and the sacrifices they sod in the brazen vessels
and caldrons with a good savor,
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C1V13">&nbsp;</a>and set them before all the people: and afterward they prepared for themselves, and for the priests their
brethren, the sons of Aaron.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C1V14">&nbsp;</a>For the priests offered the fat until night: and the Levites prepared for themselves, and for the priests
their brethren, the sons of Aaron.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C1V15">&nbsp;</a>The holy singers also, the sons of Asaph, were in their order, according to the appointment of David,

 was of the king’s retinue.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C1V16">&nbsp;</a>Moreover the gatekeepers were at every gate; none had need to depart from his daily course: for their
brethren the Levites prepared for them.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C1V17">&nbsp;</a>Thus were the things that belonged to the sacrifices of the Lord accomplished in that day, in holding
the passover,
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C1V18">&nbsp;</a>and offering sacrifices upon the altar of the Lord, according to the commandment of King Josias.
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C1V19">&nbsp;</a>So the children of Israel which were present at that time held the passover, and the feast of unleavened
bread seven days.
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C1V20">&nbsp;</a>And such a passover was not held in Israel since the time of the prophet Samuel.
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C1V21">&nbsp;</a>Yes, all the kings of Israel held not such a passover as Josias, and the priests, and the Levites, and
the Jews, held with all Israel that were present in their dwelling place at Jerusalem.
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C1V22">&nbsp;</a>In the eighteenth year of the reign of Josias was this passover held.
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C1V23">&nbsp;</a>And the works of Josias were upright before his Lord with a heart full of godliness.
 <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C1V24">&nbsp;</a>Moreover the things that came to pass in his days have been written in times past, concerning those that
sinned, and did wickedly against the Lord above every people and kingdom, and how they grieved him

 Now after all these acts of Josias it came to pass, that Pharaoh the king of Egypt came to raise war
at Carchemish upon Euphrates: and Josias went out against him.
 <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C1V26">&nbsp;</a>But the king of Egypt sent to him, saying, What have I to do with you, O king of Judaea?
 <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C1V27">&nbsp;</a>I am not sent out from the Lord God against you; for my war is upon Euphrates: and now the Lord is with
me, yes, the Lord is with me hasting me forward: depart from me, and be not against the Lord.
 <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C1V28">&nbsp;</a>Howbeit Josias did not turn back

 to his chariot, but undertook to fight with him, not regarding the words of the prophet Jeremy
<span class="add">spoken</span> by the mouth of the Lord:
 <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C1V29">&nbsp;</a>but joined battle with him in the plain of Megiddo, and the princes came down against King Josias.
 <span class="verse"> 30</span><a name="C1V30">&nbsp;</a>Then said the king to his servants, Carry me away out of the battle; for I am very weak. And immediately
his servants carried him away out of the host.
 <span class="verse"> 31</span><a name="C1V31">&nbsp;</a>Then got he up upon his second chariot; and being brought back to Jerusalem he died, and was buried in
the sepulchre of his fathers.
 <span class="verse"> 32</span><a name="C1V32">&nbsp;</a>And in all Jewry they mourned for Josias; and Jeremy the prophet lamented for Josias, and the chief men
with the women made lamentation for him, to this day: and this was given out for an ordinance to be done
continually in all the nation of Israel.
 <span class="verse"> 33</span><a name="C1V33">&nbsp;</a>These things are written in the book of the histories of the kings of Judea, and every one of the acts
that Josias did, and his glory, and his understanding in the law of the Lord, and the things that he
had done before, and the things now
<span class="add">recited</span>, are reported in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah.
