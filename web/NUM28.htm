made by fire, of a pleasant aroma to me, in their due season.’

year old without defect, two day by day, for a continual burnt offering.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C28V4">&nbsp;</a>You shall offer the one lamb in the morning, and you shall offer the other lamb at evening;

of strong drink to Yahweh in the holy place.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C28V8">&nbsp;</a>The other lamb you shall offer at evening. As the meal offering of the morning, and as its drink offering,
you shall offer it, an offering made by fire, of a pleasant aroma to Yahweh.
