 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C12V1">&nbsp;</a>Therefore I urge you, brothers, by the mercies of God, to present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy,
acceptable to God, which is your spiritual service.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C12V2">&nbsp;</a>Don’t be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, so that you may prove
what is the good, well-pleasing, and perfect will of God.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C12V3">&nbsp;</a>For I say, through the grace that was given me, to every man who is among you, not to think of himself
more highly than he ought to think; but to think reasonably, as God has apportioned to each person a
measure of faith.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C12V4">&nbsp;</a>For even as we have many members in one body, and all the members don’t have the same function,
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C12V5">&nbsp;</a>so we, who are many, are one body in Christ, and individually members one of another.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C12V6">&nbsp;</a>Having gifts differing according to the grace that was given to us, if prophecy, let us prophesy according
to the proportion of our faith;
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C12V7">&nbsp;</a>or service, let us give ourselves to service; or he who teaches, to his teaching;
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C12V8">&nbsp;</a>or he who exhorts, to his exhorting: he who gives, let him do it with liberality; he who rules, with
diligence; he who shows mercy, with cheerfulness.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C12V9">&nbsp;</a>Let love be without hypocrisy. Abhor that which is evil. Cling to that which is good.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C12V10">&nbsp;</a>In love of the brothers be tenderly affectionate to one another; in honor preferring one another;
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C12V11">&nbsp;</a>not lagging in diligence; fervent in spirit; serving the Lord;
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C12V12">&nbsp;</a>rejoicing in hope; enduring in troubles; continuing steadfastly in prayer;
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C12V13">&nbsp;</a>contributing to the needs of the saints; given to hospitality.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C12V14">&nbsp;</a>Bless those who persecute you; bless, and don’t curse.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C12V15">&nbsp;</a>Rejoice with those who rejoice. Weep with those who weep.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C12V16">&nbsp;</a>Be of the same mind one toward another. Don’t set your mind on high things, but associate with the humble.
Don’t be wise in your own conceits.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C12V17">&nbsp;</a>Repay no one evil for evil. Respect what is honorable in the sight of all men.
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C12V18">&nbsp;</a>If it is possible, as much as it is up to you, be at peace with all men.
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C12V19">&nbsp;</a>Don’t seek revenge yourselves, beloved, but give place to God’s wrath. For it is written, “Vengeance
belongs to me; I will repay, says the Lord.”
