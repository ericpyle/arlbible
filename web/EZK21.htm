 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C21V1">&nbsp;</a>Yahweh’s word came to me, saying,
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C21V2">&nbsp;</a>“Son of man, set your face toward Jerusalem, and preach toward the sanctuaries, and prophesy against
the land of Israel.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C21V3">&nbsp;</a>Tell the land of Israel, ‘Yahweh says: “Behold, I am against you, and will draw my sword out of its sheath,
and will cut off from you the righteous and the wicked.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C21V4">&nbsp;</a>Seeing then that I will cut off from you the righteous and the wicked, therefore my sword will go out
of its sheath against all flesh from the south to the north.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C21V5">&nbsp;</a>All flesh will know that I, Yahweh, have drawn my sword out of its sheath. It will not return any more.”’

 and with bitterness.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C21V7">&nbsp;</a>It shall be, when they ask you, ‘Why do you sigh?’ that you shall say, ‘Because of the news, for it comes!
Every heart will melt, all hands will be feeble, every spirit will faint, and all knees will be weak
as water. Behold, it comes, and it shall be done, says the Lord Yahweh.’”

<div class="q2">It is pointed for slaughter.

<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C21V18">&nbsp;</a>Yahweh’s word came to me again, saying,

come out of one land, and mark out a place; mark it out at the head of the way to the city.
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C21V20">&nbsp;</a>You shall appoint a way for the sword to come to Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and to Judah in Jerusalem
the fortified.
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C21V21">&nbsp;</a>For the king of Babylon stood at the parting of the way, at the head of the two ways, to use divination.
He shook the arrows back and forth. He consulted the teraphim.<a href="#FN2"><span class="notemark">†</span><span class="popup">teraphim were household idols that may have been associated with inheritance rights to the household
property.</span></a>
 He looked in the liver.
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C21V22">&nbsp;</a>In his right hand was the lot for Jerusalem, to set battering rams, to open the mouth in the slaughter,
to lift up the voice with shouting, to set battering rams against the gates, to cast up mounds, to build
forts.
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C21V23">&nbsp;</a>It will be to them as a false divination in their sight, who have sworn oaths to them; but he brings
iniquity to memory, that they may be taken.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C21V24">&nbsp;</a>“Therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh: ‘Because you have made your iniquity to be remembered, in that
your transgressions are uncovered, so that in all your doings your sins appear; because you have come
to memory, you will be taken with the hand.

<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C21V25">&nbsp;</a>“‘You, deadly wounded wicked one, the prince of Israel, whose day has come, in the time of the iniquity
of the end,

that which is low, and abase that which is high.
 <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C21V27">&nbsp;</a>I will overturn, overturn, overturn it. This also will be no more, until he comes whose right it is;
and I will give it.”’

<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 31</span><a name="C21V31">&nbsp;</a>I will pour out my indignation on you;

<div class="q2">I will blow on you with the fire of my wrath;
