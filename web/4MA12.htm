 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C12V1">&nbsp;</a>When he, too, had undergone blessed martyrdom, and died in the caldron into which he had been thrown,
the seventh, the youngest of all, came forward:
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C12V2">&nbsp;</a>whom the tyrant pitying, though he had been dreadfully reproached by his brethren,
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C12V3">&nbsp;</a>seeing him already encompassed with chains, had him brought nearer, and endeavoured to counsel him, saying,
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C12V4">&nbsp;</a>You see the end of the madness of your brethren: for they have died in torture through disobedience;
and you, if disobedient, having been miserably tormented, will yourself perish prematurely.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C12V5">&nbsp;</a>But if you obey, you shall be my friend, and have a charge over the affairs of the kingdom.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C12V6">&nbsp;</a>And having thus exhorted him, he sent for the mother of the boy; that, by condoling with her for the
loss of so many sons, he might incline her, through the hope of safety, to render the survivor obedient.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C12V7">&nbsp;</a>And he, after his mother had urged him on in the Hebrew tongue, (as we shall soon relate) says,
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C12V8">&nbsp;</a>Release me that I may speak to the king and all his friends.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C12V9">&nbsp;</a>And they, rejoicing exceedingly at the promise of the youth, quickly let him go.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C12V10">&nbsp;</a>And he, running up to the pans, said,
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C12V11">&nbsp;</a>Impious tyrant, and most blasphemous man, were you not ashamed, having received prosperity and a kingdom
from God, to kill His servants, and to rack the doers of godliness?
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C12V12">&nbsp;</a>Wherefore the divine vengeance is reserving you for eternal fire and torments, which shall cling to you
for all time.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C12V13">&nbsp;</a>Were you not ashamed, man as you are, yet most savage, to cut out the tongues of men of like feeling
and origin, and having thus abused to torture them?
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C12V14">&nbsp;</a>But they, bravely dying, fulfilled their religion towards God.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C12V15">&nbsp;</a>But you shall groan according to your deserts for having slain without cause the champions of virtue.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C12V16">&nbsp;</a>Wherefore, he continued, I myself, being about to die,
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C12V17">&nbsp;</a>will not forsake my brethren.
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C12V18">&nbsp;</a>And I call upon the God of my fathers to be merciful to my race.
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C12V19">&nbsp;</a>But you, both living and dead, he will punish.
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C12V20">&nbsp;</a>Thus having prayed, he hurled himself into the pans; and so expired.
