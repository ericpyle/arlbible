 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C15V1">&nbsp;</a>Now we who are strong ought to bear the weaknesses of the weak, and not to please ourselves.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C15V2">&nbsp;</a>Let each one of us please his neighbor for that which is good, to be building him up.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C15V3">&nbsp;</a>For even Christ didn’t please himself. But, as it is written, “The reproaches of those who reproached
you fell on me.”<a href="#FN1"><span class="notemark"></span><span class="popup">+ Psalm 69:9</span></a>
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C15V4">&nbsp;</a>For whatever things were written before were written for our learning, that through perseverance and
through encouragement of the Scriptures we might have hope.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C15V5">&nbsp;</a>Now the God of perseverance and of encouragement grant you to be of the same mind one with another according
to Christ Jesus,
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C15V6">&nbsp;</a>that with one accord you may with one mouth glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C15V7">&nbsp;</a>Therefore accept one another, even as Christ also accepted you,<a href="#FN2"><span class="notemark">*</span><span class="popup">TR reads “us” instead of “you”</span></a>
 to the glory of God.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C15V8">&nbsp;</a>Now I say that Christ has been made a servant of the circumcision for the truth of God, that he might
confirm the promises given to the fathers,
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C15V9">&nbsp;</a>and that the Gentiles might glorify God for his mercy. As it is written,
</div>
<div class="q1">“Therefore will I give praise to you among the Gentiles,
</div>
<div class="q2">and sing to your name.”<a href="#FN3"><span class="notemark"></span><span class="popup">+ 2 Samuel 22:50; Psalm 18:49</span></a>
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C15V10">&nbsp;</a>Again he says,
</div>
<div class="q1">“Rejoice, you Gentiles, with his people.”<a href="#FN4"><span class="notemark"></span><span class="popup">+ Deuteronomy 32:43</span></a>
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C15V11">&nbsp;</a>Again,
</div>
<div class="q1">“Praise the Lord, all you Gentiles!
</div>
<div class="q2">Let all the peoples praise him.”<a href="#FN5"><span class="notemark"></span><span class="popup">+ Psalm 117:1</span></a>
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C15V12">&nbsp;</a>Again, Isaiah says,
</div>
<div class="q1">“There will be the root of Jesse,
</div>
<div class="q2">he who arises to rule over the Gentiles;
</div>
<div class="q2">in him the Gentiles will hope.”<a href="#FN6"><span class="notemark"></span><span class="popup">+ Isaiah 11:10</span></a>
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C15V13">&nbsp;</a>Now may the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, that you may abound in hope, in
the power of the Holy Spirit.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C15V14">&nbsp;</a>I myself am also persuaded about you, my brothers,<a href="#FN7"><span class="notemark">†</span><span class="popup">The word for “brothers” here and where context allows may also be correctly translated “brothers and
sisters” or “siblings.”</span></a>
 that you yourselves are full of goodness, filled with all knowledge, able also to admonish others.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C15V15">&nbsp;</a>But I write the more boldly to you in part, as reminding you, because of the grace that was given to
me by God,
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C15V16">&nbsp;</a>that I should be a servant of Christ Jesus to the Gentiles, serving as a priest of the Good News of God,
that the offering up of the Gentiles might be made acceptable, sanctified by the Holy Spirit.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C15V17">&nbsp;</a>I have therefore my boasting in Christ Jesus in things pertaining to God.
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C15V18">&nbsp;</a>For I will not dare to speak of any things except those which Christ worked through me, for the obedience
of the Gentiles, by word and deed,
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C15V19">&nbsp;</a>in the power of signs and wonders, in the power of God’s Spirit; so that from Jerusalem, and around as
far as to Illyricum, I have fully preached the Good News of Christ;
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C15V20">&nbsp;</a>yes, making it my aim to preach the Good News, not where Christ was already named, that I might not build
on another’s foundation.
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C15V21">&nbsp;</a>But, as it is written,
</div>
<div class="q1">“They will see, to whom no news of him came.
</div>
<div class="q2">They who haven’t heard will understand.”<a href="#FN8"><span class="notemark"></span><span class="popup">+ Isaiah 52:15</span></a>
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C15V22">&nbsp;</a>Therefore also I was hindered these many times from coming to you,
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C15V23">&nbsp;</a>but now, no longer having any place in these regions, and having these many years a longing to come to
you,
 <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C15V24">&nbsp;</a>whenever I travel to Spain, I will come to you. For I hope to see you on my journey, and to be helped
on my way there by you, if first I may enjoy your company for a while.
 <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C15V25">&nbsp;</a>But now, I say, I am going to Jerusalem, serving the saints.
 <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C15V26">&nbsp;</a>For it has been the good pleasure of Macedonia and Achaia to make a certain contribution for the poor
among the saints who are at Jerusalem.
 <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C15V27">&nbsp;</a>Yes, it has been their good pleasure, and they are their debtors. For if the Gentiles have been made
partakers of their spiritual things, they owe it to them also to serve them in fleshly things.
 <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C15V28">&nbsp;</a>When therefore I have accomplished this, and have sealed to them this fruit, I will go on by way of you
to Spain.
 <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C15V29">&nbsp;</a>I know that, when I come to you, I will come in the fullness of the blessing of the Good News of Christ.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 30</span><a name="C15V30">&nbsp;</a>Now I beg you, brothers, by our Lord Jesus Christ, and by the love of the Spirit, that you strive together
with me in your prayers to God for me,
 <span class="verse"> 31</span><a name="C15V31">&nbsp;</a>that I may be delivered from those who are disobedient in Judea, and that my service which I have for
Jerusalem may be acceptable to the saints;
 <span class="verse"> 32</span><a name="C15V32">&nbsp;</a>that I may come to you in joy through the will of God, and together with you, find rest.
 <span class="verse"> 33</span><a name="C15V33">&nbsp;</a>Now the God of peace be with you all. Amen.
