 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C17V1">&nbsp;</a>And some of the spearbearers said, that when she herself was about to be seized for the purpose of being
put to death, she threw herself upon the pile, rather than they should touch her person.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C17V2">&nbsp;</a>O you mother, who together with seven children did destroy the violence of the tyrant, and render void
his wicked intentions, and exhibit the nobleness of faith!
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C17V3">&nbsp;</a>For you, as an house bravely built upon the pillar of your children, did bear without swaying, the shock
of tortures.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C17V4">&nbsp;</a>Be of good cheer, therefore, O holy-minded mother! holding the firm
<span class="add">substance of the</span> hope of your steadfastness with God.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C17V5">&nbsp;</a>Not so gracious does the moon appear with the stars in heaven, as you are established honorable before
God, and fixed in the firmament with your sons who you did illuminate with religion to the stars.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C17V6">&nbsp;</a>For your bearing of children was after the fashion of a child of Abraham.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C17V7">&nbsp;</a>And, were it lawful for us to paint as on a tablet the religion of your story, the spectators would not
shudder at beholding the mother of seven children enduring for the sake of religion various tortures
even to death.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C17V8">&nbsp;</a>And it had been a worth thing to have inscribed upon the tomb itself these words as a memorial to those
of the nation,
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C17V9">&nbsp;</a>Here an aged priest, and an aged woman, and seven sons, are buried through the violence of a tyrant,
who wished to destroy the polity of the Hebrews.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C17V10">&nbsp;</a>These also avenged their nation, looking to God, and enduring torments to death.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C17V11">&nbsp;</a>For it was truly a divine contest which was carried through by them.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C17V12">&nbsp;</a>For at that time virtue presided over the contest, approving the victory through endurance, namely, immortality,
eternal life.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C17V13">&nbsp;</a>Eleazar was the first to contend: and the mother of the seven children entered the contest; and the brethren
contended.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C17V14">&nbsp;</a>The tyrant was the opposite; and the world and living men were the spectators.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C17V15">&nbsp;</a>And reverence for God conquered, and crowned her own athletes.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C17V16">&nbsp;</a>Who did not admire those champions of true legislation? who were not astonied?
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C17V17">&nbsp;</a>The tyrant himself, and all their council, admired their endurance;
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C17V18">&nbsp;</a>through which, also, they now stand beside the divine throne, and live a blessed life.
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C17V19">&nbsp;</a>For Moses says, And all the saints are under your hands.
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C17V20">&nbsp;</a>These, therefore, having been sanctified through God, have been honored not only with this honor, but
that also by their means the enemy did not overcome our nation;
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C17V21">&nbsp;</a>and that the tyrant was punished, and their country purified.
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C17V22">&nbsp;</a>For they became the ransom to the sin of the nation; and the Divine Providence saved Israel, aforetime
afflicted, by the blood of those pious ones, and the propitiatory death.
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C17V23">&nbsp;</a>For the tyrant Antiochus, looking to their manly virtue, and to their endurance in torture, proclaimed
that endurance as an example to his soldiers.
 <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C17V24">&nbsp;</a>And they proved to be to him noble and brave for land battles and for sieges; and he conquered and stormed
the towns of all his enemies.
