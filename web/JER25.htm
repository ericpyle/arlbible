<div class="chapterlabel"> 25</div><div class="p">
 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C25V1">&nbsp;</a>The word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the people of Judah, in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the
son of Josiah, king of Judah (the same was the first year of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon),
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C25V2">&nbsp;</a>which Jeremiah the prophet spoke to all the people of Judah, and to all the inhabitants of Jerusalem:
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C25V3">&nbsp;</a>From the thirteenth year of Josiah the son of Amon, king of Judah, even to this day, these twenty-three
years, Yahweh’s word has come to me, and I have spoken to you, rising up early and speaking; but you
have not listened.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C25V4">&nbsp;</a>Yahweh has sent to you all his servants the prophets, rising up early and sending them (but you have
not listened or inclined your ear to hear)
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C25V5">&nbsp;</a>saying, “Return now everyone from his evil way, and from the evil of your doings, and dwell in the land
that Yahweh has given to you and to your fathers, from of old and even forever more.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C25V6">&nbsp;</a>Don’t go after other gods to serve them or worship them, and don’t provoke me to anger with the work
of your hands; then I will do you no harm.”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C25V7">&nbsp;</a>“Yet you have not listened to me,” says Yahweh; “that you may provoke me to anger with the work of your
hands to your own hurt.”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C25V8">&nbsp;</a>Therefore Yahweh of Armies says: “Because you have not heard my words,
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C25V9">&nbsp;</a>behold, I will send and take all the families of the north,” says Yahweh, “and I will send to Nebuchadnezzar
the king of Babylon, my servant, and will bring them against this land, and against its inhabitants,
and against all these nations around. I will utterly destroy them, and make them an astonishment, and
a hissing, and perpetual desolations.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C25V10">&nbsp;</a>Moreover I will take from them the voice of mirth and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom
and the voice of the bride, the sound of the millstones, and the light of the lamp.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C25V11">&nbsp;</a>This whole land will be a desolation, and an astonishment; and these nations will serve the king of Babylon
seventy years.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C25V12">&nbsp;</a>“It will happen, when seventy years are accomplished, that I will punish the king of Babylon and that
nation,” says Yahweh, “for their iniquity. I will make the land of the Chaldeans desolate forever.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C25V13">&nbsp;</a>I will bring on that land all my words which I have pronounced against it, even all that is written in
this book, which Jeremiah has prophesied against all the nations.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C25V14">&nbsp;</a>For many nations and great kings will make bondservants of them, even of them. I will recompense them
according to their deeds, and according to the work of their hands.”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C25V15">&nbsp;</a>For Yahweh, the God of Israel, says to me: “Take this cup of the wine of wrath at my hand, and cause
all the nations, to whom I send you, to drink it.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C25V16">&nbsp;</a>They will drink, and reel back and forth, and be insane, because of the sword that I will send among
them.”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C25V17">&nbsp;</a>Then took I the cup at Yahweh’s hand, and made all the nations to drink, to whom Yahweh had sent me:
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C25V18">&nbsp;</a>Jerusalem, and the cities of Judah, with its kings and its princes, to make them a desolation, an astonishment,
a hissing, and a curse, as it is today;
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C25V19">&nbsp;</a>Pharaoh king of Egypt, with his servants, his princes, and all his people;
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C25V20">&nbsp;</a>and all the mixed people, and all the kings of the land of the Uz, all the kings of the Philistines,
Ashkelon, Gaza, Ekron, and the remnant of Ashdod;
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C25V21">&nbsp;</a>Edom, Moab, and the children of Ammon;
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C25V22">&nbsp;</a>and all the kings of Tyre, all the kings of Sidon, and the kings of the isle which is beyond the sea;
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C25V23">&nbsp;</a>Dedan, Tema, Buz, and all who have the corners of their beard cut off;
 <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C25V24">&nbsp;</a>and all the kings of Arabia, all the kings of the mixed people who dwell in the wilderness;
 <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C25V25">&nbsp;</a>and all the kings of Zimri, all the kings of Elam, and all the kings of the Medes;
 <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C25V26">&nbsp;</a>and all the kings of the north, far and near, one with another; and all the kingdoms of the world, which
are on the surface of the earth. The king of Sheshach will drink after them.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C25V27">&nbsp;</a>“You shall tell them, ‘Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel says: “Drink, and be drunk, vomit, fall, and
rise no more, because of the sword which I will send among you.”’
 <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C25V28">&nbsp;</a>It shall be, if they refuse to take the cup at your hand to drink, then you shall tell them, ‘Yahweh
of Armies says: “You shall surely drink.
 <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C25V29">&nbsp;</a>For, behold, I begin to work evil at the city which is called by my name; and should you be utterly unpunished?
You will not be unpunished; for I will call for a sword on all the inhabitants of the earth, says Yahweh
of Armies.”’
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 30</span><a name="C25V30">&nbsp;</a>“Therefore prophesy against them all these words, and tell them,
</div>
<div class="q1">“‘Yahweh will roar from on high,
</div>
<div class="q2">and utter his voice from his holy habitation.
</div>
<div class="q2">He will mightily roar against his fold.
</div>
<div class="q1">He will give a shout, as those who tread grapes,
</div>
<div class="q2">against all the inhabitants of the earth.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 31</span><a name="C25V31">&nbsp;</a>A noise will come even to the end of the earth;
</div>
<div class="q2">for Yahweh has a controversy with the nations.
</div>
<div class="q1">He will enter into judgment with all flesh.
</div>
<div class="q2">As for the wicked, he will give them to the sword,”’ says Yahweh.”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 32</span><a name="C25V32">&nbsp;</a>Yahweh of Armies says,
</div>
<div class="q1">“Behold, evil will go out from nation to nation,
</div>
<div class="q2">and a great storm will be raised up from the uttermost parts of the earth.”
</div>
<div class="m"> <span class="verse"> 33</span><a name="C25V33">&nbsp;</a>The slain of Yahweh will be at that day from one end of the earth even to the other end of the earth.
They won’t be lamented. They won’t be gathered or buried. They will be dung on the surface of the ground.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 34</span><a name="C25V34">&nbsp;</a>Wail, you shepherds, and cry.
</div>
<div class="q2">Wallow in dust, you leader of the flock;
</div>
<div class="q1">for the days of your slaughter and of your dispersions have fully come,
</div>
<div class="q2">and you will fall like fine pottery.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 35</span><a name="C25V35">&nbsp;</a>The shepherds will have no way to flee.
</div>
<div class="q2">The leader of the flock will have no escape.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 36</span><a name="C25V36">&nbsp;</a>A voice of the cry of the shepherds,
</div>
<div class="q2">and the wailing of the leader of the flock,
</div>
<div class="q2">for Yahweh destroys their pasture.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 37</span><a name="C25V37">&nbsp;</a>The peaceful folds are brought to silence
</div>
<div class="q2">because of the fierce anger of Yahweh.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 38</span><a name="C25V38">&nbsp;</a>He has left his covert, as the lion;
</div>
<div class="q2">for their land has become an astonishment because of the fierceness of the oppression,
</div>
<div class="q2">and because of his fierce anger.
