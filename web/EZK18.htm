 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C18V1">&nbsp;</a>Yahweh’s word came to me again, saying,
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C18V2">&nbsp;</a>“What do you mean, that you use this proverb concerning the land of Israel, saying,

<div class="q1">‘The fathers have eaten sour grapes,

</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C18V3">&nbsp;</a>“As I live,” says the Lord Yahweh, “you shall not use this proverb any more in Israel.

his people, behold, he will die in his iniquity.

<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C18V19">&nbsp;</a>“Yet you say, ‘Why doesn’t the son bear the iniquity of the father?’ When the son has done that which
is lawful and right, and has kept all my statutes, and has done them, he will surely live.
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C18V20">&nbsp;</a>The soul who sins, he shall die. The son shall not bear the iniquity of the father, neither shall the
father bear the iniquity of the son. The righteousness of the righteous shall be on him, and the wickedness
of the wicked shall be on him.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C18V21">&nbsp;</a>“But if the wicked turns from all his sins that he has committed, and keeps all my statutes, and does
that which is lawful and right, he shall surely live. He shall not die.
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C18V22">&nbsp;</a>None of his transgressions that he has committed will be remembered against him. In his righteousness
that he has done, he shall live.
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C18V23">&nbsp;</a>Have I any pleasure in the death of the wicked?” says the Lord Yahweh; “and not rather that he should
return from his way, and live?
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C18V24">&nbsp;</a>“But when the righteous turns away from his righteousness, and commits iniquity, and does according to
all the abominations that the wicked man does, should he live? None of his righteous deeds that he has
done will be remembered. In his trespass that he has trespassed, and in his sin that he has sinned, in
them he shall die.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C18V25">&nbsp;</a>“Yet you say, ‘The way of the Lord is not equal.’ Hear now, house of Israel: Is my way not equal? Aren’t
your ways unequal?
 <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C18V26">&nbsp;</a>When the righteous man turns away from his righteousness, and commits iniquity, and dies therein; in
his iniquity that he has done he shall die.
 <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C18V27">&nbsp;</a>Again, when the wicked man turns away from his wickedness that he has committed, and does that which
is lawful and right, he will save his soul alive.
 <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C18V28">&nbsp;</a>Because he considers, and turns away from all his transgressions that he has committed, he shall surely
live. He shall not die.
 <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C18V29">&nbsp;</a>Yet the house of Israel says, ‘The way of the Lord is not fair.’ House of Israel, aren’t my ways fair?
Aren’t your ways unfair?
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 30</span><a name="C18V30">&nbsp;</a>“Therefore I will judge you, house of Israel, everyone according to his ways,” says the Lord Yahweh.
“Return, and turn yourselves from all your transgressions; so iniquity will not be your ruin.
 <span class="verse"> 31</span><a name="C18V31">&nbsp;</a>Cast away from you all your transgressions, in which you have transgressed; and make yourself a new heart
and a new spirit: for why will you die, house of Israel?
 <span class="verse"> 32</span><a name="C18V32">&nbsp;</a>For I have no pleasure in the death of him who dies,” says the Lord Yahweh. “Therefore turn yourselves,
and live!
