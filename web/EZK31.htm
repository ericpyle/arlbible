 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C31V1">&nbsp;</a>In the eleventh year, in the third month, in the first day of the month, Yahweh’s word came to me, saying,
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C31V2">&nbsp;</a>“Son of man, tell Pharaoh king of Egypt, and to his multitude:
</div>
<div class="q1">‘Whom are you like in your greatness?
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C31V3">&nbsp;</a>Behold, the Assyrian was a cedar in Lebanon
</div>
<div class="q2">with beautiful branches,
</div>
<div class="q1">and with a forest-like shade,
</div>
<div class="q2">and of high stature;
</div>
<div class="q2">and its top was among the thick boughs.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C31V4">&nbsp;</a>The waters nourished it.
</div>
<div class="q2">The deep made it to grow.
</div>
<div class="q1">Its rivers ran all around its plantation;
</div>
<div class="q2">and it sent out its channels to all the trees of the field.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C31V5">&nbsp;</a>Therefore its stature was exalted above all the trees of the field;
</div>
<div class="q2">and its boughs were multiplied.
</div>
<div class="q1">Its branches became long by reason of many waters,
</div>
<div class="q2">when it spread them out.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C31V6">&nbsp;</a>All the birds of the sky made their nests in its boughs.
</div>
<div class="q2">Under its branches all the animals of the field gave birth to their young;
</div>
<div class="q2">and all great nations lived under its shadow.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C31V7">&nbsp;</a>Thus was it beautiful in its greatness,
</div>
<div class="q2">in the length of its branches;
</div>
<div class="q2">for its root was by many waters.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C31V8">&nbsp;</a>The cedars in the garden of God could not hide it.
</div>
<div class="q2">The cypress trees were not like its boughs.
</div>
<div class="q1">The pine trees were not as its branches;
</div>
<div class="q2">nor was any tree in the garden of God like it in its beauty.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C31V9">&nbsp;</a>I made it beautiful by the multitude of its branches,
</div>
<div class="q2">so that all the trees of Eden,
</div>
<div class="q2">that were in the garden of God, envied it.’
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C31V10">&nbsp;</a>“Therefore thus said the Lord Yahweh: ‘Because you are exalted in stature, and he has set his top among
the thick boughs, and his heart is lifted up in his height;
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C31V11">&nbsp;</a>I will even deliver him into the hand of the mighty one of the nations. He will surely deal with him.
I have driven him out for his wickedness.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C31V12">&nbsp;</a>Strangers, the terrible of the nations, have cut him off, and have left him. On the mountains and in
all the valleys his branches are fallen, and his boughs are broken by all the watercourses of the land.
All the peoples of the earth have gone down from his shadow, and have left him.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C31V13">&nbsp;</a>On his ruin all the birds of the sky will dwell, and all the animals of the field will be on his branches;
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C31V14">&nbsp;</a>to the end that none of all the trees by the waters exalt themselves in their stature, neither set their
top among the thick boughs, nor that their mighty ones stand up on their height, even all who drink water:
for they are all delivered to death, to the lower parts of the earth, among the children of men, with
those who go down to the pit.’
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C31V15">&nbsp;</a>“Thus says the Lord Yahweh: ‘In the day when he went down to Sheol
<a href="#FN1"><span class="notemark">*</span><span class="popup">Sheol is the place of the dead.</span></a>
 I caused a mourning. I covered the deep for him, and I restrained its rivers; and the great waters were
stayed; and I caused Lebanon to mourn for him, and all the trees of the field fainted for him.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C31V16">&nbsp;</a>I made the nations to shake at the sound of his fall, when I cast him down to Sheol<a href="#FN2"><span class="notemark">†</span><span class="popup">Sheol is the place of the dead.</span></a>
 with those who descend into the pit; and all the trees of Eden, the choice and best of Lebanon, all
that drink water, were comforted in the lower parts of the earth.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C31V17">&nbsp;</a>They also went down into Sheol with him to those who are slain by the sword; yes, those who were his
arm, who lived under his shadow in the middle of the nations.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C31V18">&nbsp;</a>“‘To whom are you thus like in glory and in greatness among the trees of Eden? Yet you will be brought
down with the trees of Eden to the lower parts of the earth. You will lie in the middle of the uncircumcised,
with those who are slain by the sword.
</div>
