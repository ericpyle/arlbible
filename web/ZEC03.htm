 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C3V1">&nbsp;</a>He showed me Joshua the high priest standing before Yahweh’s angel, and Satan standing at his right hand
to be his adversary.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C3V2">&nbsp;</a>Yahweh said to Satan, “Yahweh rebuke you, Satan! Yes, Yahweh who has chosen Jerusalem rebuke you! Isn’t
this a burning stick plucked out of the fire?”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C3V3">&nbsp;</a>Now Joshua was clothed with filthy garments, and was standing before the angel.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C3V4">&nbsp;</a>He answered and spoke to those who stood before him, saying, “Take the filthy garments off of him.” To
him he said, “Behold, I have caused your iniquity to pass from you, and I will clothe you with rich clothing.”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C3V5">&nbsp;</a>I said, “Let them set a clean turban on his head.”
</div>
<div class="p">So they set a clean turban on his head, and clothed him; and Yahweh’s angel was standing by.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C3V6">&nbsp;</a>Yahweh’s angel protested to Joshua, saying,
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C3V7">&nbsp;</a>“Yahweh of Armies says: ‘If you will walk in my ways, and if you will follow my instructions, then you
also shall judge my house, and shall also keep my courts, and I will give you a place of access among
these who stand by.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C3V8">&nbsp;</a>Hear now, Joshua the high priest, you and your fellows who sit before you; for they are men who are a
sign: for, behold, I will bring out my servant, the Branch.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C3V9">&nbsp;</a>For, behold, the stone that I have set before Joshua; on one stone are seven eyes: behold, I will engrave
its engraving,’ says Yahweh of Armies, ‘and I will remove the iniquity of that land in one day.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C3V10">&nbsp;</a>In that day,’ says Yahweh of Armies, ‘you will invite every man his neighbor under the vine and under
the fig tree.’”
