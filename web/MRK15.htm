 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C15V1">&nbsp;</a>Immediately in the morning the chief priests, with the elders and scribes, and the whole council, held
a consultation, and bound Jesus, and carried him away, and delivered him up to Pilate.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C15V2">&nbsp;</a>Pilate asked him, “Are you the King of the Jews?”
</div>
<div class="p">He answered,
<span class="wj">“So you say.”</span></div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C15V3">&nbsp;</a>The chief priests accused him of many things.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C15V4">&nbsp;</a>Pilate again asked him, “Have you no answer? See how many things they testify against you!”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C15V5">&nbsp;</a>But Jesus made no further answer, so that Pilate marveled.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C15V6">&nbsp;</a>Now at the feast he used to release to them one prisoner, whom they asked of him.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C15V7">&nbsp;</a>There was one called Barabbas, bound with his fellow insurgents, men who in the insurrection had committed
murder.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C15V8">&nbsp;</a>The multitude, crying aloud, began to ask him to do as he always did for them.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C15V9">&nbsp;</a>Pilate answered them, saying, “Do you want me to release to you the King of the Jews?”
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C15V10">&nbsp;</a>For he perceived that for envy the chief priests had delivered him up.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C15V11">&nbsp;</a>But the chief priests stirred up the multitude, that he should release Barabbas to them instead.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C15V12">&nbsp;</a>Pilate again asked them, “What then should I do to him whom you call the King of the Jews?”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C15V13">&nbsp;</a>They cried out again, “Crucify him!”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C15V14">&nbsp;</a>Pilate said to them, “Why, what evil has he done?”
</div>
<div class="p">But they cried out exceedingly, “Crucify him!”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C15V15">&nbsp;</a>Pilate, wishing to please the multitude, released Barabbas to them, and handed over Jesus, when he had
flogged him, to be crucified.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C15V16">&nbsp;</a>The soldiers led him away within the court, which is the Praetorium; and they called together the whole
cohort.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C15V17">&nbsp;</a>They clothed him with purple, and weaving a crown of thorns, they put it on him.
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C15V18">&nbsp;</a>They began to salute him, “Hail, King of the Jews!”
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C15V19">&nbsp;</a>They struck his head with a reed, and spat on him, and bowing their knees, did homage to him.
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C15V20">&nbsp;</a>When they had mocked him, they took the purple off of him, and put his own garments on him. They led
him out to crucify him.
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C15V21">&nbsp;</a>They compelled one passing by, coming from the country, Simon of Cyrene, the father of Alexander and
Rufus, to go with them, that he might bear his cross.
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C15V22">&nbsp;</a>They brought him to the place called Golgotha, which is, being interpreted, “The place of a skull.”
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C15V23">&nbsp;</a>They offered him wine mixed with myrrh to drink, but he didn’t take it.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C15V24">&nbsp;</a>Crucifying him, they parted his garments among them, casting lots on them, what each should take.
 <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C15V25">&nbsp;</a>It was the third hour,<a href="#FN1"><span class="notemark">*</span><span class="popup">9:00 a.m.</span></a>
 and they crucified him.
 <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C15V26">&nbsp;</a>The superscription of his accusation was written over him, “THE KING OF THE JEWS.”
 <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C15V27">&nbsp;</a>With him they crucified two robbers; one on his right hand, and one on his left.
 <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C15V28">&nbsp;</a>The Scripture was fulfilled, which says, “He was counted with transgressors.”<a href="#FN2"><span class="notemark">†</span><span class="popup">NU omits verse 28.</span></a>
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C15V29">&nbsp;</a>Those who passed by blasphemed him, wagging their heads, and saying, “Ha! You who destroy the temple,
and build it in three days,
 <span class="verse"> 30</span><a name="C15V30">&nbsp;</a>save yourself, and come down from the cross!”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 31</span><a name="C15V31">&nbsp;</a>Likewise, also the chief priests mocking among themselves with the scribes said, “He saved others. He
can’t save himself.
 <span class="verse"> 32</span><a name="C15V32">&nbsp;</a>Let the Christ, the King of Israel, now come down from the cross, that we may see and believe him.”<a href="#FN3"><span class="notemark">‡</span><span class="popup">TR omits “him”</span></a>
 Those who were crucified with him also insulted him.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 33</span><a name="C15V33">&nbsp;</a>When the sixth hour<a href="#FN4"><span class="notemark">§</span><span class="popup">or, noon</span></a>
 had come, there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour.<a href="#FN5"><span class="notemark">**</span><span class="popup">3:00 p.m.</span></a>
 <span class="verse"> 34</span><a name="C15V34">&nbsp;</a>At the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying,
<span class="wj">“Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?”</span> which is, being interpreted,
<span class="wj">“My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?”</span><a href="#FN6"><span class="notemark"></span><span class="popup">+ Psalm 22:1</span></a>
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 35</span><a name="C15V35">&nbsp;</a>Some of those who stood by, when they heard it, said, “Behold, he is calling Elijah.”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 36</span><a name="C15V36">&nbsp;</a>One ran, and filling a sponge full of vinegar, put it on a reed, and gave it to him to drink, saying,
“Let him be. Let’s see whether Elijah comes to take him down.”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 37</span><a name="C15V37">&nbsp;</a>Jesus cried out with a loud voice, and gave up the spirit.
 <span class="verse"> 38</span><a name="C15V38">&nbsp;</a>The veil of the temple was torn in two from the top to the bottom.
 <span class="verse"> 39</span><a name="C15V39">&nbsp;</a>When the centurion, who stood by opposite him, saw that he cried out like this and breathed his last,
he said, “Truly this man was the Son of God!”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 40</span><a name="C15V40">&nbsp;</a>There were also women watching from afar, among whom were both Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of
James the less and of Joses, and Salome;
 <span class="verse"> 41</span><a name="C15V41">&nbsp;</a>who, when he was in Galilee, followed him, and served him; and many other women who came up with him
to Jerusalem.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 42</span><a name="C15V42">&nbsp;</a>When evening had now come, because it was the Preparation Day, that is, the day before the Sabbath,
 <span class="verse"> 43</span><a name="C15V43">&nbsp;</a>Joseph of Arimathaea, a prominent council member who also himself was looking for God’s Kingdom, came.
He boldly went in to Pilate, and asked for Jesus’ body.
 <span class="verse"> 44</span><a name="C15V44">&nbsp;</a>Pilate marveled if he were already dead; and summoning the centurion, he asked him whether he had been
dead long.
 <span class="verse"> 45</span><a name="C15V45">&nbsp;</a>When he found out from the centurion, he granted the body to Joseph.
 <span class="verse"> 46</span><a name="C15V46">&nbsp;</a>He bought a linen cloth, and taking him down, wound him in the linen cloth, and laid him in a tomb which
had been cut out of a rock. He rolled a stone against the door of the tomb.
 <span class="verse"> 47</span><a name="C15V47">&nbsp;</a>Mary Magdalene and Mary, the mother of Joses, saw where he was laid.
