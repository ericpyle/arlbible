</div>
<div class="chapterlabel"> 1</div><div class="p">
 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C1V1">&nbsp;</a>Paul, Silvanus, and Timothy, to the assembly of the Thessalonians in God our Father, and the Lord Jesus
Christ:
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C1V2">&nbsp;</a>Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C1V3">&nbsp;</a>We are bound to always give thanks to God for you, brothers,<a href="#FN1"><span class="notemark">*</span><span class="popup">The word for “brothers” here and where context allows may also be correctly translated “brothers and
sisters” or “siblings.”</span></a>
 even as it is appropriate, because your faith grows exceedingly, and the love of each and every one
of you towards one another abounds;
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C1V4">&nbsp;</a>so that we ourselves boast about you in the assemblies of God for your perseverance and faith in all
your persecutions and in the afflictions which you endure.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C1V5">&nbsp;</a>This is an obvious sign of the righteous judgment of God, to the end that you may be counted worthy of
God’s Kingdom, for which you also suffer.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C1V6">&nbsp;</a>Since it is a righteous thing with God to repay affliction to those who afflict you,
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C1V7">&nbsp;</a>and to give relief to you who are afflicted with us, when the Lord Jesus is revealed from heaven with
his mighty angels in flaming fire,
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C1V8">&nbsp;</a>giving vengeance to those who don’t know God, and to those who don’t obey the Good News of our Lord Jesus,
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C1V9">&nbsp;</a>who will pay the penalty: eternal destruction from the face of the Lord and from the glory of his might,
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C1V10">&nbsp;</a>when he comes to be glorified in his saints, and to be admired among all those who have believed (because
our testimony to you was believed) in that day.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C1V11">&nbsp;</a>To this end we also pray always for you, that our God may count you worthy of your calling, and fulfill
every desire of goodness and work of faith, with power;
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C1V12">&nbsp;</a>that the name of our Lord Jesus<a href="#FN2"><span class="notemark">†</span><span class="popup">TR adds “Christ”</span></a>
 may be glorified in you, and you in him, according to the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ.
