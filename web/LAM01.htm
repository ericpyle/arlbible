</div>
<div class="q2">that was full of people!
</div>
<div class="q1">She has become as a widow,
</div>
<div class="q2">who was great among the nations!
</div>
<div class="q1">She who was a princess among the provinces
</div>
<div class="q2">has become tributary!

<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C1V2">&nbsp;</a>She weeps bitterly in the night,
</div>
<div class="q2">and her tears are on her cheeks;

<div class="q1">among all her lovers
</div>
<div class="q2">she has no one to comfort her:
</div>
<div class="q1">All her friends have dealt treacherously with her;

<div class="q2">they have become her enemies.

<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C1V3">&nbsp;</a>Judah has gone into captivity because of affliction,
</div>
<div class="q2">and because of great servitude;

<div class="q2">she finds no rest:
</div>
<div class="q2">all her persecutors overtook her within the straits.

<div class="b"></div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C1V4">&nbsp;</a>The ways of Zion mourn,
