 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C16V1">&nbsp;</a>And John went up from Gazara, and told Simon his father what Cendebaeus was doing.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C16V2">&nbsp;</a>And Simon called his two oldest sons, Judas and John, and said to them, I and my brethren and my father’s
house have fought the battles of Israel from our youth, even to this day; and things have prospered in
our hands, that we should deliver Israel oftentimes.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C16V3">&nbsp;</a>But now I am old, and you⌃ moreover, by
<span class="add">his
</span> mercy, are of a sufficient age: be you⌃ instead of me and my brother, and go forth and fight for our
nation; but let the help which is from heaven be with you.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C16V4">&nbsp;</a>And he chose out of the country twenty thousand men of war and horsemen, and they went against Cendebaeus,
and slept at Modin.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C16V5">&nbsp;</a>And rising up in the morning, they went into the plain, and, behold, a great host came to meet them,
of footmen and horsemen: and there was a brook between them.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C16V6">&nbsp;</a>And he encamped over against them, he and his people: and he saw that the people were afraid to pass
over the brook, and he passed over first, and the men saw him, and passed over after him.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C16V7">&nbsp;</a>And he divided the people, and
<span class="add">set
</span> the horsemen in the midst of the footmen: but the enemies’ horsemen were exceeding many.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C16V8">&nbsp;</a>And they sounded with the trumpets; and Cendebaeus and his army were put to the rout, and there fell
of them many wounded to death, but they that were left fled to the stronghold:
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C16V9">&nbsp;</a>at that time was Judas John’s brother wounded: but John pursued after them, till he came to Kidron, which
<span class="add">Cendebaeus
</span> had built;
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C16V10">&nbsp;</a>and they fled to the towers that are in the fields of Azotus; and he burned it with fire; and there fell
of them about two thousand men. And he returned into Judaea in peace.

<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C16V11">&nbsp;</a>And Ptolemy the son of Abubus had been appointed captain for the plain of Jericho, and he had much silver
and gold;
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C16V12">&nbsp;</a>for he was the high priest’s son in law.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C16V13">&nbsp;</a>And his heart was lifted up, and he was minded to make himself master of the country, and he took counsel
deceitfully against Simon and his sons, to make away with them.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C16V14">&nbsp;</a>Now Simon was visiting the cities that were in the country, and taking care for the good ordering of
them; and he went down to Jericho, himself and Mattathias and Judas his sons, in

 the hundred and seventy and seventh year, in the eleventh month, the same is the month Sebat:
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C16V15">&nbsp;</a>and the son of Abubus received them deceitfully into the little stronghold that is called Dok, which
he had built, and made them a great banquet, and hid men there.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C16V16">&nbsp;</a>And when Simon and his sons had drunk freely, Ptolemy and his men rose up, and took their arms, and came
in upon Simon into the banqueting place, and killed him, and his two sons, and certain of his servants.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C16V17">&nbsp;</a>And he committed a great iniquity, and recompensed evil for good.
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C16V18">&nbsp;</a>And Ptolemy wrote these things, and sent to the king, that he should send him forces to aid him, and
should deliver him their country and the cities.
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C16V19">&nbsp;</a>And he sent others to Gazara to make away with John: and to the captains of thousands he sent letters
to come to him, that he might give them silver and gold and gifts.
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C16V20">&nbsp;</a>And others he sent to take possession of Jerusalem, and the mount of the temple.
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C16V21">&nbsp;</a>And one ran before to Gazara, and told John that his father and brethren were perished, and he has sent
to kill you also.
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C16V22">&nbsp;</a>And when he heard, he was sore amazed; and he laid hands on the men that came to destroy him, and killed
them; for he perceived that they were seeking to destroy him.
