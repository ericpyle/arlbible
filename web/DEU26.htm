it, and dwell in it,
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C26V2">&nbsp;</a>that you shall take some of the first of all the fruit of the ground, which you shall bring in from your
land that Yahweh your God gives you. You shall put it in a basket, and shall go to the place which Yahweh
your God shall choose, to cause his name to dwell there.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C26V3">&nbsp;</a>You shall come to the priest who shall be in those days, and tell him, “I profess today to Yahweh your
God, that I have come to the land which Yahweh swore to our fathers to give us.”
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C26V4">&nbsp;</a>The priest shall take the basket out of your hand, and set it down before Yahweh your God’s altar.

 was a Syrian ready to perish. He went down into Egypt, and lived there, few in number. There he became
a great, mighty, and populous nation.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C26V6">&nbsp;</a>The Egyptians mistreated us, afflicted us, and imposed hard labor on us.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C26V7">&nbsp;</a>Then we cried to Yahweh, the God of our fathers. Yahweh heard our voice, and saw our affliction, our
toil, and our oppression.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C26V8">&nbsp;</a>Yahweh brought us out of Egypt with a mighty hand, with an outstretched arm, with great terror, with
signs, and with wonders;
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C26V9">&nbsp;</a>and he has brought us into this place, and has given us this land, a land flowing with milk and honey.

that they may eat within your gates, and be filled.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C26V13">&nbsp;</a>You shall say before Yahweh your God, “I have put away the holy things out of my house, and also have
given them to the Levite, to the foreigner, to the fatherless, and to the widow, according to all your
commandment which you have commanded me. I have not transgressed any of your commandments, neither have
I forgotten them.

of it for the dead. I have listened to Yahweh my God’s voice. I have done according to all that you have
commanded me.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C26V15">&nbsp;</a>Look down from your holy habitation, from heaven, and bless your people Israel, and the ground which

you should keep all his commandments.
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C26V19">&nbsp;</a>He will make you high above all nations that he has made, in praise, in name, and in honor; and that
you may be a holy people to Yahweh your God, as he has spoken.
