<div class="p">I answered, “I see a flying scroll; its length is twenty cubits,<a href="#FN1"><span class="notemark">*</span><span class="popup">A cubit is the length from the tip of the middle finger to the elbow on a man’s arm, or about 18 inches
or 46 centimeters.</span></a>
 and its width ten cubits.”

<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C5V3">&nbsp;</a>Then he said to me, “This is the curse that goes out over the surface of the whole land; for everyone
who steals shall be cut off according to it on the one side; and everyone who swears falsely shall be
cut off according to it on the other side.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C5V4">&nbsp;</a>I will cause it to go out,” says Yahweh of Armies, “and it will enter into the house of the thief, and
into the house of him who swears falsely by my name; and it will remain in the middle of his house, and
will destroy it with its timber and its stones.”

<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C5V5">&nbsp;</a>Then the angel who talked with me came forward, and said to me, “Lift up now your eyes, and see what
is this that is appearing.”

 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C5V8">&nbsp;</a>He said, “This is Wickedness”; and he threw her down into the middle of the ephah basket; and he threw
the weight of lead on its mouth.

<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C5V9">&nbsp;</a>Then lifted I up my eyes, and saw, and behold, there were two women, and the wind was in their wings.
Now they had wings like the wings of a stork, and they lifted up the ephah basket between earth and the
sky.
