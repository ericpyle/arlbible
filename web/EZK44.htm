it was shut.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C44V2">&nbsp;</a>Yahweh said to me, “This gate shall be shut. It shall not be opened, neither shall any man enter in by
it; for Yahweh, the God of Israel, has entered in by it. Therefore it shall be shut.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C44V3">&nbsp;</a>As for the prince, he shall sit therein as prince to eat bread before Yahweh. He shall enter by the way

<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C44V4">&nbsp;</a>Then he brought me by the way of the north gate before the house; and I looked, and behold, Yahweh’s

<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C44V5">&nbsp;</a>Yahweh said to me, “Son of man, mark well, and see with your eyes, and hear with your ears all that I
tell you concerning all the ordinances of Yahweh’s house, and all its laws; and mark well the entrance
of the house, with every exit of the sanctuary.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C44V6">&nbsp;</a>You shall tell the rebellious, even the house of Israel, ‘Thus says the Lord Yahweh: “You house of Israel,
let it suffice you of all your abominations,
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C44V7">&nbsp;</a>in that you have brought in foreigners, uncircumcised in heart and uncircumcised in flesh, to be in my
sanctuary, to profane it, even my house, when you offer my bread, the fat and the blood, and they have
broken my covenant, to add to all your abominations.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C44V8">&nbsp;</a>You have not performed the duty of my holy things; but you have set performers of my duty in my sanctuary
for yourselves.”
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C44V9">&nbsp;</a>Thus says the Lord Yahweh, “No foreigner, uncircumcised in heart and uncircumcised in flesh, shall enter
into my sanctuary, of any foreigners who are among the children of Israel.

idols, they will bear their iniquity.

in the house. They shall kill the burnt offering and the sacrifice for the people, and they shall stand
before them to minister to them.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C44V12">&nbsp;</a>Because they ministered to them before their idols, and became a stumbling block of iniquity to the house
of Israel. Therefore I have lifted up my hand against them,” says the Lord Yahweh, “and they will bear
their iniquity.

holy things, to the things that are most holy; but they will bear their shame, and their abominations
which they have committed.

me to offer to me the fat and the blood,” says the Lord Yahweh.
