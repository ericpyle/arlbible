 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C1V1">&nbsp;</a>The words of Jeremiah the son of Hilkiah, one of the priests who were in Anathoth in the land of Benjamin.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C1V2">&nbsp;</a>Yahweh’s word<a href="#FN1"><span class="notemark">*</span><span class="popup">“Yahweh” is God’s proper Name, sometimes rendered “LORD” (all caps) in other translations.</span></a>
 came to him in the days of Josiah the son of Amon, king of Judah, in the thirteenth year of his reign.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C1V3">&nbsp;</a>It came also in the days of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, to the end of the eleventh year
of Zedekiah, the son of Josiah, king of Judah, to the carrying away of Jerusalem captive in the fifth
month.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C1V4">&nbsp;</a>Now Yahweh’s word came to me, saying,
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C1V5">&nbsp;</a>“Before I formed you in the womb, I knew you.
</div>
<div class="q2">Before you were born, I sanctified you.
</div>
<div class="q2">I have appointed you a prophet to the nations.”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C1V6">&nbsp;</a>Then I said, “Ah, Lord<a href="#FN2"><span class="notemark">†</span><span class="popup">The word translated “Lord” is “Adonai.”
</span></a>
 Yahweh! Behold,<a href="#FN3"><span class="notemark">‡</span><span class="popup">“Behold”, from “הִנֵּה”, means look at, take notice, observe, see, or gaze at. It is often used as an

 I don’t know how to speak; for I am a child.”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C1V7">&nbsp;</a>But Yahweh said to me, “Don’t say, ‘I am a child;’ for you must go to whomever I send you, and you must
say whatever I command you.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C1V8">&nbsp;</a>Don’t be afraid because of them, for I am with you to rescue you,” says Yahweh.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C1V9">&nbsp;</a>Then Yahweh stretched out his hand, and touched my mouth. Then Yahweh said to me, “Behold, I have put
my words in your mouth.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C1V10">&nbsp;</a>Behold, I have today set you over the nations and over the kingdoms, to uproot and to tear down, to destroy
and to overthrow, to build and to plant.”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C1V11">&nbsp;</a>Moreover Yahweh’s word came to me, saying, “Jeremiah, what do you see?”
</div>
<div class="p">I said, “I see a branch of an almond tree.”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C1V12">&nbsp;</a>Then Yahweh said to me, “You have seen well; for I watch over my word to perform it.”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C1V13">&nbsp;</a>Yahweh’s word came to me the second time, saying, “What do you see?”
</div>
<div class="p">I said, “I see a boiling cauldron; and it is tipping away from the north.”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C1V14">&nbsp;</a>Then Yahweh said to me, “Out of the north, evil will break out on all the inhabitants of the land.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C1V15">&nbsp;</a>For, behold, I will call all the families of the kingdoms of the north,” says Yahweh.
</div>
<div class="q1">“They will come, and they will each set his throne at the entrance of the gates of Jerusalem,
</div>
<div class="q2">and against all its walls all around, and against all the cities of Judah.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C1V16">&nbsp;</a>I will utter my judgments against them concerning all their wickedness,
</div>
<div class="q2">in that they have forsaken me,
</div>
<div class="q2">and have burned incense to other gods,
</div>
<div class="q2">and worshiped the works of their own hands.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C1V17">&nbsp;</a>“You therefore put your belt on your waist, arise, and say to them all that I command you. Don’t be dismayed
at them, lest I dismay you before them.
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C1V18">&nbsp;</a>For, behold, I have made you today a fortified city, an iron pillar, and bronze walls, against the whole
land, against the kings of Judah, against its princes, against its priests, and against the people of
the land.
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C1V19">&nbsp;</a>They will fight against you, but they will not prevail against you; for I am with you”, says Yahweh,
“to rescue you.”
