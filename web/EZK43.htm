 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C43V2">&nbsp;</a>Behold, the glory of the God of Israel came from the way of the east: and his voice was like the sound
of many waters; and the earth shined with his glory.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C43V3">&nbsp;</a>It was according to the appearance of the vision which I saw, even according to the vision that I saw
when I came to destroy the city; and the visions were like the vision that I saw by the river Chebar;
and I fell on my face.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C43V4">&nbsp;</a>Yahweh’s glory came into the house by the way of the gate whose prospect is toward the east.

I will dwell among the children of Israel forever. The house of Israel will no more defile my holy name,
neither they, nor their kings, by their prostitution, and by the dead bodies of their kings in their
high places;
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C43V8">&nbsp;</a>in their setting of their threshold by my threshold, and their door post beside my door post, and there
was a wall between me and them; and they have defiled my holy name by their abominations which they have
committed: therefore I have consumed them in my anger.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C43V9">&nbsp;</a>Now let them put away their prostitution, and the dead bodies of their kings, far from me; and I will
dwell among them forever.

and let them measure the pattern.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C43V11">&nbsp;</a>If they be ashamed of all that they have done, make known to them the form of the house, and its fashion,
and its exits, and its entrances, and all its forms, and all its ordinances, and all its forms, and all
its laws; and write it in their sight; that they may keep the whole form of it, and all its ordinances,
and do them.

<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C43V18">&nbsp;</a>He said to me, “Son of man, thus says the Lord Yahweh: ‘These are the ordinances of the altar in the
day when they make it, to offer burnt offerings on it, and to sprinkle blood on it.

and on the border all around: thus you shall cleanse it and make atonement for it.
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C43V21">&nbsp;</a>You shall also take the bull of the sin offering, and it shall be burned in the appointed place of the

the altar, as they cleansed it with the bull.

flock without defect.
 <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C43V24">&nbsp;</a>You shall bring them near to Yahweh, and the priests shall cast salt on them, and they shall offer them
up for a burnt offering to Yahweh.

<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C43V25">&nbsp;</a>“Seven days you shall prepare every day a goat for a sin offering: they shall also prepare a young bull,
and a ram out of the flock, without defect.

 <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C43V27">&nbsp;</a>When they have accomplished the days, it shall be that on the eighth day, and forward, the priests shall
make your burnt offerings on the altar, and your peace offerings; and I will accept you,’ says the Lord
Yahweh.”
