 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C4V1">&nbsp;</a>I command you therefore before God and the Lord Jesus Christ, who will judge the living and the dead
at his appearing and his Kingdom:
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C4V2">&nbsp;</a>preach the word; be urgent in season and out of season; reprove, rebuke, and exhort, with all patience
and teaching.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C4V3">&nbsp;</a>For the time will come when they will not listen to the sound doctrine, but, having itching ears, will
heap up for themselves teachers after their own lusts;
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C4V4">&nbsp;</a>and will turn away their ears from the truth, and turn aside to fables.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C4V5">&nbsp;</a>But you be sober in all things, suffer hardship, do the work of an evangelist, and fulfill your ministry.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C4V6">&nbsp;</a>For I am already being offered, and the time of my departure has come.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C4V7">&nbsp;</a>I have fought the good fight. I have finished the course. I have kept the faith.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C4V8">&nbsp;</a>From now on, there is stored up for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge,
will give to me on that day; and not to me only, but also to all those who have loved his appearing.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C4V9">&nbsp;</a>Be diligent to come to me soon,
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C4V10">&nbsp;</a>for Demas left me, having loved this present world, and went to Thessalonica; Crescens to Galatia, and
Titus to Dalmatia.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C4V11">&nbsp;</a>Only Luke is with me. Take Mark, and bring him with you, for he is useful to me for service.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C4V12">&nbsp;</a>But I sent Tychicus to Ephesus.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C4V13">&nbsp;</a>Bring the cloak that I left at Troas with Carpus when you come, and the books, especially the parchments.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C4V14">&nbsp;</a>Alexander, the coppersmith, did much evil to me. The Lord will repay him according to his deeds,
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C4V15">&nbsp;</a>of whom you also must beware; for he greatly opposed our words.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C4V16">&nbsp;</a>At my first defense, no one came to help me, but all left me. May it not be held against them.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C4V17">&nbsp;</a>But the Lord stood by me, and strengthened me, that through me the message might be fully proclaimed,
and that all the Gentiles might hear; and I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion.
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C4V18">&nbsp;</a>And the Lord will deliver me from every evil work, and will preserve me for his heavenly Kingdom; to
whom be the glory forever and ever. Amen.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C4V19">&nbsp;</a>Greet Prisca and Aquila, and the house of Onesiphorus.
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C4V20">&nbsp;</a>Erastus remained at Corinth, but I left Trophimus at Miletus sick.
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C4V21">&nbsp;</a>Be diligent to come before winter. Eubulus salutes you, as do Pudens, Linus, Claudia, and all the brothers.
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C4V22">&nbsp;</a>The Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Grace be with you. Amen.
