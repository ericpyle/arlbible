 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C11V1">&nbsp;</a>Therefore you shall love Yahweh your God, and keep his instructions, his statutes, his ordinances, and
his commandments, always.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C11V2">&nbsp;</a>Know this day: for I don’t speak with your children who have not known, and who have not seen the chastisement
of Yahweh your God, his greatness, his mighty hand, his outstretched arm,
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C11V3">&nbsp;</a>his signs, and his works, which he did in the middle of Egypt to Pharaoh the king of Egypt, and to all
his land;
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C11V4">&nbsp;</a>and what he did to the army of Egypt, to their horses, and to their chariots; how he made the water of
the Red Sea to overflow them as they pursued you, and how Yahweh has destroyed them to this day;
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C11V5">&nbsp;</a>and what he did to you in the wilderness, until you came to this place;
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C11V6">&nbsp;</a>and what he did to Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, the son of Reuben; how the earth opened its
mouth, and swallowed them up, and their households, and their tents, and every living thing that followed
them, in the middle of all Israel;
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C11V7">&nbsp;</a>but your eyes have seen all of Yahweh’s great work which he did.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C11V8">&nbsp;</a>Therefore you shall keep all the commandment which I command you today, that you may be strong, and go
in and possess the land, where you go over to possess it;
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C11V9">&nbsp;</a>and that you may prolong your days in the land, which Yahweh swore to your fathers to give to them and
to their offspring,<a href="#FN1"><span class="notemark">*</span><span class="popup">or, seed</span></a>
 a land flowing with milk and honey.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C11V10">&nbsp;</a>For the land, where you go in to possess it, isn’t as the land of Egypt, that you came out of, where
you sowed your seed, and watered it with your foot, as a garden of herbs;
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C11V11">&nbsp;</a>but the land, where you go over to possess it, is a land of hills and valleys which drinks water from
the rain of the sky,
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C11V12">&nbsp;</a>a land which Yahweh your God cares for. Yahweh your God’s eyes are always on it, from the beginning of
the year even to the end of the year.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C11V13">&nbsp;</a>It shall happen, if you shall listen diligently to my commandments which I command you today, to love
Yahweh your God, and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul,
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C11V14">&nbsp;</a>that I will give the rain of your land in its season, the former rain and the latter rain, that you may
gather in your grain, your new wine, and your oil.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C11V15">&nbsp;</a>I will give grass in your fields for your livestock, and you shall eat and be full.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C11V16">&nbsp;</a>Be careful, lest your heart be deceived, and you turn aside, and serve other gods, and worship them;
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C11V17">&nbsp;</a>and Yahweh’s anger be kindled against you, and he shut up the sky, so that there is no rain, and the
land doesn’t yield its fruit; and you perish quickly from off the good land which Yahweh gives you.
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C11V18">&nbsp;</a>Therefore you shall lay up these my words in your heart and in your soul. You shall bind them for a sign
on your hand, and they shall be for frontlets between your eyes.
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C11V19">&nbsp;</a>You shall teach them your children, talking of them, when you sit in your house, and when you walk by
the way, and when you lie down, and when you rise up.
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C11V20">&nbsp;</a>You shall write them on the door posts of your house, and on your gates;
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C11V21">&nbsp;</a>that your days may be multiplied, and the days of your children, in the land which Yahweh swore to your
fathers to give them, as the days of the heavens above the earth.
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C11V22">&nbsp;</a>For if you shall diligently keep all these commandments which I command you, to do them, to love Yahweh
your God, to walk in all his ways, and to cling to him;
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C11V23">&nbsp;</a>then will Yahweh drive out all these nations from before you, and you shall dispossess nations greater
and mightier than yourselves.
 <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C11V24">&nbsp;</a>Every place whereon the sole of your foot treads shall be yours: from the wilderness, and Lebanon, from
the river, the river Euphrates, even to the western sea shall be your border.
 <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C11V25">&nbsp;</a>No man will be able to stand before you. Yahweh your God will lay the fear of you and the dread of you
on all the land that you tread on, as he has spoken to you.
 <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C11V26">&nbsp;</a>Behold, I set before you today a blessing and a curse:
 <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C11V27">&nbsp;</a>the blessing, if you listen to the commandments of Yahweh your God, which I command you today;
 <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C11V28">&nbsp;</a>and the curse, if you do not listen to the commandments of Yahweh your God, but turn aside out of the
way which I command you today, to go after other gods, which you have not known.
 <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C11V29">&nbsp;</a>It shall happen, when Yahweh your God brings you into the land where you go to possess it, that you shall
set the blessing on Mount Gerizim, and the curse on Mount Ebal.
 <span class="verse"> 30</span><a name="C11V30">&nbsp;</a>Aren’t they beyond the Jordan, behind the way of the going down of the sun, in the land of the Canaanites
who dwell in the Arabah, near Gilgal, beside the oaks of Moreh?
 <span class="verse"> 31</span><a name="C11V31">&nbsp;</a>For you are to pass over the Jordan to go in to possess the land which Yahweh your God gives you, and
you shall possess it, and dwell therein.
 <span class="verse"> 32</span><a name="C11V32">&nbsp;</a>You shall observe to do all the statutes and the ordinances which I set before you today.
