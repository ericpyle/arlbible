<div class="chapterlabel"> 8</div><div class="p">
 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C8V1">&nbsp;</a>The word of Yahweh of Armies came to me.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C8V2">&nbsp;</a>Yahweh of Armies says: “I am jealous for Zion with great jealousy, and I am jealous for her with great
wrath.”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C8V3">&nbsp;</a>Yahweh says: “I have returned to Zion, and will dwell in the middle of Jerusalem. Jerusalem shall be
called ‘The City of Truth;’ and the mountain of Yahweh of Armies, ‘The Holy Mountain.’”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C8V4">&nbsp;</a>Yahweh of Armies says: “Old men and old women will again dwell in the streets of Jerusalem, every man
with his staff in his hand for very age.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C8V5">&nbsp;</a>The streets of the city will be full of boys and girls playing in its streets.”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C8V6">&nbsp;</a>Yahweh of Armies says: “If it is marvelous in the eyes of the remnant of this people in those days, should
it also be marvelous in my eyes?” says Yahweh of Armies.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C8V7">&nbsp;</a>Yahweh of Armies says: “Behold, I will save my people from the east country, and from the west country;
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C8V8">&nbsp;</a>and I will bring them, and they will dwell within Jerusalem; and they will be my people, and I will be
their God, in truth and in righteousness.”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C8V9">&nbsp;</a>Yahweh of Armies says: “Let your hands be strong, you who hear in these days these words from the mouth
of the prophets who were in the day that the foundation of the house of Yahweh of Armies was laid, even
the temple, that it might be built.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C8V10">&nbsp;</a>For before those days there was no wages for man, nor any wages for an animal; neither was there any
peace to him who went out or came in, because of the adversary. For I set all men everyone against his
neighbor.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C8V11">&nbsp;</a>But now I will not be to the remnant of this people as in the former days,” says Yahweh of Armies.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C8V12">&nbsp;</a>“For the seed of peace and the vine will yield its fruit, and the ground will give its increase, and
the heavens will give their dew; and I will cause the remnant of this people to inherit all these things.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C8V13">&nbsp;</a>It shall come to pass that, as you were a curse among the nations, house of Judah and house of Israel,
so will I save you, and you shall be a blessing. Don’t be afraid. Let your hands be strong.”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C8V14">&nbsp;</a>For Yahweh of Armies says: “As I thought to do evil to you, when your fathers provoked me to wrath,”
says Yahweh of Armies, “and I didn’t repent;
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C8V15">&nbsp;</a>so again I have thought in these days to do good to Jerusalem and to the house of Judah. Don’t be afraid.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C8V16">&nbsp;</a>These are the things that you shall do: speak every man the truth with his neighbor. Execute the judgment
of truth and peace in your gates,
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C8V17">&nbsp;</a>and let none of you devise evil in your hearts against his neighbor, and love no false oath: for all
these are things that I hate,” says Yahweh.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C8V18">&nbsp;</a>The word of Yahweh of Armies came to me.
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C8V19">&nbsp;</a>Yahweh of Armies says: “The fasts of the fourth fifth, seventh, and tenth months shall be for the house
of Judah joy and gladness, and cheerful feasts. Therefore love truth and peace.”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C8V20">&nbsp;</a>Yahweh of Armies says: “Many peoples, and the inhabitants of many cities will yet come;
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C8V21">&nbsp;</a>and the inhabitants of one shall go to another, saying, ‘Let us go speedily to entreat the favor of Yahweh,
and to seek Yahweh of Armies. I will go also.’
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C8V22">&nbsp;</a>Yes, many peoples and strong nations will come to seek Yahweh of Armies in Jerusalem, and to entreat
the favor of Yahweh.”
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C8V23">&nbsp;</a>Yahweh of Armies says: “In those days, ten men will take hold, out of all the languages of the nations,
they will take hold of the skirt of him who is a Jew, saying, ‘We will go with you, for we have heard
that God is with you.’”
