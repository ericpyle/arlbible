 word came to Zechariah the son of Berechiah, the son of Iddo, the prophet, saying,
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C1V2">&nbsp;</a>“Yahweh was very displeased with your fathers.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C1V3">&nbsp;</a>Therefore tell them: Yahweh of Armies says: ‘Return to me,’ says Yahweh of Armies, ‘and I will return
to you,’ says Yahweh of Armies.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C1V4">&nbsp;</a>Don’t you be like your fathers, to whom the former prophets proclaimed, saying: Yahweh of Armies says,
‘Return now from your evil ways, and from your evil doings;’ but they did not hear, nor listen to me,
says Yahweh.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C1V5">&nbsp;</a>Your fathers, where are they? And the prophets, do they live forever?
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C1V6">&nbsp;</a>But my words and my decrees, which I commanded my servants the prophets, didn’t they overtake your fathers?
</div>
<div class="p">“Then they repented and said, ‘Just as Yahweh of Armies determined to do to us, according to our ways,
and according to our practices, so he has dealt with us.’”
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C1V7">&nbsp;</a>On the twenty-fourth day of the eleventh month, which is the month Shebat, in the second year of Darius,
Yahweh’s word came to Zechariah the son of Berechiah, the son of Iddo, the prophet, saying,
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C1V8">&nbsp;</a>“I had a vision in the night, and behold,<a href="#FN2"><span class="notemark">†</span><span class="popup">“Behold”, from “הִנֵּה”, means look at, take notice, observe, see, or gaze at. It is often used as an

 a man riding on a red horse, and he stood among the myrtle trees that were in a ravine; and behind him
there were red, brown, and white horses.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C1V9">&nbsp;</a>Then I asked, ‘My lord, what are these?’”
</div>
<div class="p">The angel who talked with me said to me, “I will show you what these are.”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C1V10">&nbsp;</a>The man who stood among the myrtle trees answered, “They are the ones Yahweh has sent to go back and
forth through the earth.”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C1V11">&nbsp;</a>They reported to Yahweh’s angel who stood among the myrtle trees, and said, “We have walked back and
forth through the earth, and behold, all the earth is at rest and in peace.”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C1V12">&nbsp;</a>Then Yahweh’s angel replied, “O Yahweh of Armies, how long will you not have mercy on Jerusalem and on
the cities of Judah, against which you have had indignation these seventy years?”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C1V13">&nbsp;</a>Yahweh answered the angel who talked with me with kind and comforting words.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C1V14">&nbsp;</a>So the angel who talked with me said to me, “Proclaim, saying, ‘Yahweh of Armies says: “I am jealous
for Jerusalem and for Zion with a great jealousy.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C1V15">&nbsp;</a>I am very angry with the nations that are at ease; for I was but a little displeased, but they added
to the calamity.”
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C1V16">&nbsp;</a>Therefore Yahweh says: “I have returned to Jerusalem with mercy. My house shall be built in it,” says
Yahweh of Armies, “and a line shall be stretched out over Jerusalem.”’
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C1V17">&nbsp;</a>“Proclaim further, saying, ‘Yahweh of Armies says: “My cities will again overflow with prosperity, and
Yahweh will again comfort Zion, and will again choose Jerusalem.”’”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C1V18">&nbsp;</a>I lifted up my eyes, and saw, and behold, four horns.
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C1V19">&nbsp;</a>I asked the angel who talked with me, “What are these?”
</div>
<div class="p">He answered me, “These are the horns which have scattered Judah, Israel, and Jerusalem.”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C1V20">&nbsp;</a>Yahweh showed me four craftsmen.
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C1V21">&nbsp;</a>Then I asked, “What are these coming to do?”
</div>
<div class="p">He said, “These are the horns which scattered Judah, so that no man lifted up his head; but these have
come to terrify them, to cast down the horns of the nations, which lifted up their horn against the land
of Judah to scatter it.”
