 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C11V1">&nbsp;</a>Now after a very little time Lysias, the king’s guardian and kinsman and chancellor, being sore displeased
for the things that had come to pass,
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C11V2">&nbsp;</a>collected about fourscore thousand
<span class="add">footmen
</span> and all his horsemen and came against the Jews, thinking to make the city a place for Greeks to dwell
in,
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C11V3">&nbsp;</a>and to levy tribute on the temple, as
<a href="#FN1"><span class="notemark">*</span><span class="popup">Or,
on all the sacred places of the heathen
</span></a>
 on the other sacred places of the nations, and to put up the high priesthood to sale every year;
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C11V4">&nbsp;</a>holding in no account the might of God, but puffed up with his ten thousands of footmen, and his thousands
of horsemen, and his fourscore elephants.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C11V5">&nbsp;</a>And coming into Judaea and drawing near to Bethsuron, which was a strong place and distant from Jerusalem
about
<a href="#FN2"><span class="notemark">†</span><span class="popup">The Greek text here is uncertain.
</span></a>
 five leagues, he pressed it hard.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C11V6">&nbsp;</a>But when Maccabaeus and his men learned that he was besieging the strongholds, they and all the people
with lamentations and tears made supplication to the Lord to send a good angel to save Israel.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C11V7">&nbsp;</a>And Maccabaeus himself took up arms first, and exhorted the others to jeopard themselves together with
him and succour their brethren; and they sallied forth with him right willingly.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C11V8">&nbsp;</a>And as they were there, close to Jerusalem, there appeared at their head one on horseback in white apparel,
brandishing
<a href="#FN3"><span class="notemark">‡</span><span class="popup">Gr.
a panoply.
</span></a>
 weapons of gold.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C11V9">&nbsp;</a>And they all together praised the merciful God, and were yet more strengthened in heart: being ready
to
<a href="#FN4"><span class="notemark">§</span><span class="popup">Gr.
wound.
</span></a>
 assail not men only but the wildest beasts, and walls of iron,
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C11V10">&nbsp;</a>they advanced in array, having him that is in heaven to fight on their side, for the Lord had mercy on
them.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C11V11">&nbsp;</a>And hurling
<span class="add">themselves
</span> like lions upon the enemy, they killed of them eleven thousand
<span class="add">footmen
</span> and sixteen hundred horsemen, and forced all
<span class="add">the rest
</span> to flee.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C11V12">&nbsp;</a>But the more part of them escaped wounded
<span class="add">and
</span> naked; and Lysias also himself escaped by shameful flight.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C11V13">&nbsp;</a>But as he was a man not void of understanding, weighing with himself the defeat which had befallen him,
and considering that the Hebrews could not be overcome, because the Almighty God fought on their side,
he sent again
<span class="add">to them,
</span> <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C11V14">&nbsp;</a>and persuaded them to come to terms on condition that all their rights were acknowledged, and
<a href="#FN5"><span class="notemark">**</span><span class="popup">The Greek text here is corrupt.
</span></a>
<span class="add">promised
</span> that he would also persuade the king to become their friend.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C11V15">&nbsp;</a>And Maccabaeus gave consent upon all the conditions which Lysias proposed to him, being careful of the
<span class="add">common
</span> good; for whatever
<span class="add">requests
</span> Maccabaeus delivered in writing to Lysias concerning the Jews the king allowed.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C11V16">&nbsp;</a>For the letters written to the Jews from Lysias were to this effect:
</div>
<div class="p">Lysias to the
<a href="#FN6"><span class="notemark">††</span><span class="popup">Gr.
multitude.
</span></a>
 people of the Jews, greeting.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C11V17">&nbsp;</a>John and Absalom, who were sent from you, having delivered the
<a href="#FN7"><span class="notemark">‡‡</span><span class="popup">Or,
document
</span></a>
 petition written below, made request concerning the things signified therein.
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C11V18">&nbsp;</a>What things soever therefore had need to be brought before the king I declared
<span class="add">to him,
</span> and what things were possible he allowed.
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C11V19">&nbsp;</a>If then you⌃ will preserve your good will toward the state, henceforward also will I endeavor to contribute
to
<span class="add">your
</span> good.
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C11V20">&nbsp;</a><a href="#FN8"><span class="notemark">§§</span><span class="popup">Or,
but as to this.
</span></a>
 And on this behalf I have given order in detail, both to these men and to those
<span class="add">that are sent
</span> from me, to confer with you.
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C11V21">&nbsp;</a>Fare you⌃ well.
<span class="add">Written

 Dioscorinthius.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C11V22">&nbsp;</a>And the king’s letter was in these words:
</div>
<div class="p">King Antiochus to his brother Lysias, greeting.
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C11V23">&nbsp;</a>Seeing that our father passed to the gods having the wish that the subjects of his kingdom
<a href="#FN10"><span class="notemark">†††</span><span class="popup">Or,
should not be disquieted but
</span></a>
 should be undisturbed and give themselves to the care of their own affairs,
 <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C11V24">&nbsp;</a>we, having heard that the Jews do not consent to our father’s purpose to turn them to the
<span class="add">customs
</span> of the Greeks, but choose rather their own manner of living, and make request that the
<span class="add">customs
</span> of their law be allowed to them,—
 <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C11V25">&nbsp;</a>choosing therefore that this nation also should be free from
<a href="#FN11"><span class="notemark">‡‡‡</span><span class="popup">Or,
disquiet
</span></a>
 disturbance, we determine that their temple be restored to them, and that they live according to the
customs that were in the days of their ancestors.
 <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C11V26">&nbsp;</a>You will therefore do well to send
<span class="add">messengers
</span> to them and give them the right hand
<span class="add">of friendship,
</span> that they, knowing our mind, may be of good heart, and gladly occupy themselves with the conduct of
their own affairs.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C11V27">&nbsp;</a>And to the nation the king’s letter was after this manner:
</div>
<div class="p">King Antiochus to the senate of the Jews and to the other Jews, greeting.
 <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C11V28">&nbsp;</a>If you⌃ fare well, we have our desire: we ourselves also are in good health.
 <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C11V29">&nbsp;</a>Menelaus informed us that your desire was to return home and follow your own business.
 <span class="verse"> 30</span><a name="C11V30">&nbsp;</a>They therefore that depart home up to the thirties day of Xanthicus shall have

 <span class="verse"> 31</span><a name="C11V31">&nbsp;</a>that the Jews use their own
<span class="add">proper

<span class="add">observe their own
</span> laws, even as heretofore; and none of them shall be in any way molested for the things that have been
ignorantly done.
 <span class="verse"> 32</span><a name="C11V32">&nbsp;</a>Moreover I have sent Menelaus also, that he may encourage you.

<span class="add">Written
</span> in the hundred forty and eighth year, on the fifteenth day of Xanthicus.

</div>
<div class="p">Quintus Memmius
<span class="add">and
</span> Titus Manius, ambassadors of the Romans, to the people of the Jews, greeting.
 <span class="verse"> 35</span><a name="C11V35">&nbsp;</a>In regard to the things which Lysias the king’s kinsman granted you, we also give consent.
 <span class="verse"> 36</span><a name="C11V36">&nbsp;</a>But as for the things which he judged should be referred to the king, send one forthwith, after you⌃
have advised thereof, that we may publish such
<span class="add">decrees
</span> as befit your case; for we are on our way to Antioch.
 <span class="verse"> 37</span><a name="C11V37">&nbsp;</a>Wherefore send some with speed, that we also may learn what is your mind.
