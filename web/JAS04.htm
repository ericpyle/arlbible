 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C4V1">&nbsp;</a>Where do wars and fightings among you come from? Don’t they come from your pleasures that war in your
members?
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C4V2">&nbsp;</a>You lust, and don’t have. You murder and covet, and can’t obtain. You fight and make war. You don’t have,
because you don’t ask.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C4V3">&nbsp;</a>You ask, and don’t receive, because you ask with wrong motives, so that you may spend it for your pleasures.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C4V4">&nbsp;</a>You adulterers and adulteresses, don’t you know that friendship with the world is hostility toward God?
Whoever therefore wants to be a friend of the world makes himself an enemy of God.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C4V5">&nbsp;</a>Or do you think that the Scripture says in vain, “The Spirit who lives in us yearns jealously”?
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C4V6">&nbsp;</a>But he gives more grace. Therefore it says, “God resists the proud, but gives grace to the humble.”<a href="#FN1"><span class="notemark"></span><span class="popup">+ Proverbs 3:34</span></a>
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C4V7">&nbsp;</a>Be subject therefore to God. But resist the devil, and he will flee from you.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C4V8">&nbsp;</a>Draw near to God, and he will draw near to you. Cleanse your hands, you sinners; and purify your hearts,
you double-minded.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C4V9">&nbsp;</a>Lament, mourn, and weep. Let your laughter be turned to mourning, and your joy to gloom.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C4V10">&nbsp;</a>Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord, and he will exalt you.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C4V11">&nbsp;</a>Don’t speak against one another, brothers. He who speaks against a brother and judges his brother, speaks
against the law and judges the law. But if you judge the law, you are not a doer of the law, but a judge.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C4V12">&nbsp;</a>Only one is the lawgiver, who is able to save and to destroy. But who are you to judge another?
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C4V13">&nbsp;</a>Come now, you who say, “Today or tomorrow let’s go into this city, and spend a year there, trade, and
make a profit.”
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C4V14">&nbsp;</a>Whereas you don’t know what your life will be like tomorrow. For what is your life? For you are a vapor,
that appears for a little time, and then vanishes away.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C4V15">&nbsp;</a>For you ought to say, “If the Lord wills, we will both live, and do this or that.”
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C4V16">&nbsp;</a>But now you glory in your boasting. All such boasting is evil.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C4V17">&nbsp;</a>To him therefore who knows to do good, and doesn’t do it, to him it is sin.
