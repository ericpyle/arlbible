 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C5V1">&nbsp;</a>Therefore I exhort the elders among you, as a fellow elder, and a witness of the sufferings of Christ,
and who will also share in the glory that will be revealed.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C5V2">&nbsp;</a>Shepherd the flock of God which is among you, exercising the oversight, not under compulsion, but voluntarily,
not for dishonest gain, but willingly;
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C5V3">&nbsp;</a>neither as lording it over those entrusted to you, but making yourselves examples to the flock.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C5V4">&nbsp;</a>When the chief Shepherd is revealed, you will receive the crown of glory that doesn’t fade away.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C5V5">&nbsp;</a>Likewise, you younger ones, be subject to the elder. Yes, all of you clothe yourselves with humility,
to subject yourselves to one another; for “God resists the proud, but gives grace to the humble.”<a href="#FN1"><span class="notemark"></span><span class="popup">+ Proverbs 3:34
</span></a>
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C5V6">&nbsp;</a>Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in due time;
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C5V7">&nbsp;</a>casting all your worries on him, because he cares for you.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C5V8">&nbsp;</a>Be sober and self-controlled. Be watchful. Your adversary, the devil, walks around like a roaring lion,
seeking whom he may devour.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C5V9">&nbsp;</a>Withstand him steadfast in your faith, knowing that your brothers who are in the world are undergoing
the same sufferings.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C5V10">&nbsp;</a>But may the God of all grace, who called you to his eternal glory by Christ Jesus, after you have suffered
a little while, perfect, establish, strengthen, and settle you.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C5V11">&nbsp;</a>To him be the glory and the power forever and ever. Amen.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C5V12">&nbsp;</a>Through Silvanus, our faithful brother, as I consider him, I have written to you briefly, exhorting,
and testifying that this is the true grace of God in which you stand.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C5V13">&nbsp;</a>She who is in Babylon, chosen together with you, greets you; and so does Mark, my son.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C5V14">&nbsp;</a>Greet one another with a kiss of love. Peace be to you all who are in Christ Jesus. Amen.
