 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C9V1">&nbsp;</a>I saw the Lord standing beside the altar, and he said, “Strike the tops of the pillars, that the thresholds
may shake; and break them in pieces on the head of all of them; and I will kill the last of them with
the sword: there shall not one of them flee away, and there shall not one of them escape.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C9V2">&nbsp;</a>Though they dig into Sheol,<a href="#FN1"><span class="notemark">*</span><span class="popup">Sheol is the place of the dead.</span></a>
 there my hand will take them; and though they climb up to heaven, there I will bring them down.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C9V3">&nbsp;</a>Though they hide themselves in the top of Carmel, I will search and take them out there; and though they
be hidden from my sight in the bottom of the sea, there I will command the serpent, and it will bite
them.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C9V4">&nbsp;</a>Though they go into captivity before their enemies, there I will command the sword, and it will kill
them. I will set my eyes on them for evil, and not for good.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C9V5">&nbsp;</a>For the Lord, Yahweh of Armies, is he who touches the land and it melts, and all who dwell in it will
mourn; and it will rise up wholly like the River, and will sink again, like the River of Egypt.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C9V6">&nbsp;</a>It is he who builds his rooms in the heavens, and has founded his vault on the earth; he who calls for
the waters of the sea, and pours them out on the surface of the earth; Yahweh is his name.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C9V7">&nbsp;</a>Are you not like the children of the Ethiopians to me, children of Israel?” says Yahweh. “Haven’t I brought
up Israel out of the land of Egypt, and the Philistines from Caphtor, and the Syrians from Kir?
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C9V8">&nbsp;</a>Behold, the eyes of the Lord Yahweh are on the sinful kingdom, and I will destroy it from off the surface
of the earth; except that I will not utterly destroy the house of Jacob,” says Yahweh.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C9V9">&nbsp;</a>“For, behold, I will command, and I will sift the house of Israel among all the nations, as grain is
sifted in a sieve, yet not the least kernel will fall on the earth.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C9V10">&nbsp;</a>All the sinners of my people will die by the sword, who say, ‘Evil won’t overtake nor meet us.’
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C9V11">&nbsp;</a>In that day I will raise up the tent of David who is fallen, and close up its breaches, and I will raise
up its ruins, and I will build it as in the days of old;
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C9V12">&nbsp;</a>that they may possess the remnant of Edom, and all the nations who are called by my name,” says Yahweh
who does this.

<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C9V13">&nbsp;</a>“Behold, the days come,” says Yahweh,
</div>
<div class="q2">“that the plowman shall overtake the reaper,
</div>
<div class="q2">and the one treading grapes him who sows seed;
</div>
<div class="q2">and sweet wine will drip from the mountains,
</div>
<div class="q2">and flow from the hills.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C9V14">&nbsp;</a>I will bring my people Israel back from captivity,
</div>
<div class="q2">and they will rebuild the ruined cities, and inhabit them;
</div>
<div class="q2">and they will plant vineyards, and drink wine from them.
</div>
<div class="q1">They shall also make gardens,
</div>
<div class="q2">and eat their fruit.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C9V15">&nbsp;</a>I will plant them on their land,
</div>
<div class="q2">and they will no more be plucked up out of their land which I have given them,”
</div>
<div class="q2">says Yahweh your God.
