<div class="chapterlabel"> 22</div><div class="p">
 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C22V1">&nbsp;</a>David therefore departed from there, and escaped to the cave of Adullam. When his brothers and all his
father’s house heard it, they went down there to him.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C22V2">&nbsp;</a>Everyone who was in distress, everyone who was in debt, and everyone who was discontented, gathered themselves
to him; and he became captain over them. There were with him about four hundred men.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C22V3">&nbsp;</a>David went from there to Mizpeh of Moab, and he said to the king of Moab, “Please let my father and my
mother come out with you, until I know what God will do for me.”
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C22V4">&nbsp;</a>He brought them before the king of Moab; and they lived with him all the time that David was in the stronghold.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C22V5">&nbsp;</a>The prophet Gad said to David, “Don’t stay in the stronghold. Depart, and go into the land of Judah.”
</div>
<div class="p">Then David departed, and came into the forest of Hereth.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C22V6">&nbsp;</a>Saul heard that David was discovered, with the men who were with him. Now Saul was sitting in Gibeah,
under the tamarisk tree in Ramah, with his spear in his hand, and all his servants were standing around
him.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C22V7">&nbsp;</a>Saul said to his servants who stood around him, “Hear now, you Benjamites! Will the son of Jesse give
everyone of you fields and vineyards? Will he make you all captains of thousands and captains of hundreds,
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C22V8">&nbsp;</a>that all of you have conspired against me, and there is no one who discloses to me when my son makes
a treaty with the son of Jesse, and there is none of you who is sorry for me, or discloses to me that
my son has stirred up my servant against me, to lie in wait, as it is today?”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C22V9">&nbsp;</a>Then Doeg the Edomite, who stood by the servants of Saul, answered and said, “I saw the son of Jesse
coming to Nob, to Ahimelech the son of Ahitub.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C22V10">&nbsp;</a>He inquired of Yahweh for him, gave him food, and gave him the sword of Goliath the Philistine.”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C22V11">&nbsp;</a>Then the king sent to call Ahimelech the priest, the son of Ahitub, and all his father’s house, the priests
who were in Nob; and they all came to the king.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C22V12">&nbsp;</a>Saul said, “Hear now, you son of Ahitub.”
</div>
<div class="p">He answered, “Here I am, my lord.”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C22V13">&nbsp;</a>Saul said to him, “Why have you conspired against me, you and the son of Jesse, in that you have given
him bread, and a sword, and have inquired of God for him, that he should rise against me, to lie in wait,
as it is today?”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C22V14">&nbsp;</a>Then Ahimelech answered the king, and said, “Who among all your servants is so faithful as David, who
is the king’s son-in-law, and is taken into your council, and is honorable in your house?
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C22V15">&nbsp;</a>Have I today begun to inquire of God for him? Be it far from me! Don’t let the king impute anything to
his servant, nor to all the house of my father; for your servant knows nothing of all this, less or more.”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C22V16">&nbsp;</a>The king said, “You shall surely die, Ahimelech, you, and all your father’s house.”
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C22V17">&nbsp;</a>The king said to the guard who stood about him, “Turn, and kill the priests of Yahweh; because their
hand also is with David, and because they knew that he fled, and didn’t disclose it to me.” But the servants
of the king wouldn’t put out their hand to fall on the priests of Yahweh.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C22V18">&nbsp;</a>The king said to Doeg, “Turn and attack the priests!”
</div>
<div class="p">Doeg the Edomite turned, and he attacked the priests, and he killed on that day eighty-five people who
wore a linen ephod.
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C22V19">&nbsp;</a>He struck Nob, the city of the priests, with the edge of the sword, both men and women, children and
nursing babies, and cattle and donkeys and sheep, with the edge of the sword.
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C22V20">&nbsp;</a>One of the sons of Ahimelech, the son of Ahitub, named Abiathar, escaped, and fled after David.
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C22V21">&nbsp;</a>Abiathar told David that Saul had slain Yahweh’s priests.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C22V22">&nbsp;</a>David said to Abiathar, “I knew on that day, when Doeg the Edomite was there, that he would surely tell
Saul. I am responsible for the death of all the persons of your father’s house.
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C22V23">&nbsp;</a>Stay with me. Don’t be afraid, for he who seeks my life seeks your life. For you will be safe with me.”
