 a stormy wind came out of the north, a great cloud, with flashing lightning, and a brightness around
it, and out of the middle of it as it were glowing metal, out of the middle of the fire.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C1V5">&nbsp;</a>Out of its center came the likeness of four living creatures. This was their appearance: they had the
likeness of a man.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C1V6">&nbsp;</a>Everyone had four faces, and each one of them had four wings.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C1V7">&nbsp;</a>Their feet were straight feet; and the sole of their feet was like the sole of a calf’s foot; and they
sparkled like burnished brass.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C1V8">&nbsp;</a>They had the hands of a man under their wings on their four sides; and the four of them had their faces
and their wings thus:
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C1V9">&nbsp;</a>their wings were joined to one another; they didn’t turn when they went; each one went straight forward.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C1V10">&nbsp;</a>As for the likeness of their faces, they had the face of a man; and the four of them had the face of
a lion on the right side; and the four of them had the face of an ox on the left side; the four of them
also had the face of an eagle.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C1V11">&nbsp;</a>Such were their faces. Their wings were spread out above. Two wings of each one touched another, and
two covered their bodies.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C1V12">&nbsp;</a>Each one went straight forward: where the spirit was to go, they went; they didn’t turn when they went.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C1V13">&nbsp;</a>As for the likeness of the living creatures, their appearance was like burning coals of fire, like the
appearance of torches: the fire went up and down among the living creatures; and the fire was bright,
and lightning went out of the fire.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C1V14">&nbsp;</a>The living creatures ran and returned as the appearance of a flash of lightning.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C1V15">&nbsp;</a>Now as I saw the living creatures, behold, one wheel on the earth beside the living creatures, for each
of the four faces of it.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C1V16">&nbsp;</a>The appearance of the wheels and their work was like a beryl: and the four of them had one likeness;
and their appearance and their work was as it were a wheel within a wheel.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C1V17">&nbsp;</a>When they went, they went in their four directions: they didn’t turn when they went.
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C1V18">&nbsp;</a>As for their rims, they were high and dreadful; and the four of them had their rims full of eyes all
around.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C1V19">&nbsp;</a>When the living creatures went, the wheels went beside them; and when the living creatures were lifted
up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up.
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C1V20">&nbsp;</a>Wherever the spirit was to go, they went; there was the spirit to go: and the wheels were lifted up beside
them; for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels.
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C1V21">&nbsp;</a>When those went, these went; and when those stood, these stood; and when those were lifted up from the
earth, the wheels were lifted up beside them: for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C1V22">&nbsp;</a>Over the head of the living creature there was the likeness of an expanse, like the awesome crystal to
look on, stretched out over their heads above.
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C1V23">&nbsp;</a>Under the expanse were their wings straight, the one toward the other: each one had two which covered
on this side, and every one had two which covered on that side, their bodies.
 <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C1V24">&nbsp;</a>When they went, I heard the noise of their wings like the noise of great waters, like the voice of the
Almighty, a noise of tumult like the noise of an army: when they stood, they let down their wings.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C1V25">&nbsp;</a>There was a voice above the expanse that was over their heads: when they stood, they let down their wings.
 <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C1V26">&nbsp;</a>Above the expanse that was over their heads was the likeness of a throne, as the appearance of a sapphire<a href="#FN4"><span class="notemark">§</span><span class="popup">or, lapis lazuli</span></a>
 stone; and on the likeness of the throne was a likeness as the appearance of a man on it above.
 <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C1V27">&nbsp;</a>I saw as it were glowing metal, as the appearance of fire within it all around, from the appearance of
his waist and upward; and from the appearance of his waist and downward I saw as it were the appearance
of fire, and there was brightness around him.
 <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C1V28">&nbsp;</a>As the appearance of the rainbow that is in the cloud in the day of rain, so was the appearance of the
brightness all around.
</div>
<div class="p">This was the appearance of the likeness of Yahweh’s glory. When I saw it, I fell on my face, and I heard
a voice of one that spoke.
