 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C4V1">&nbsp;</a>And Gorgias took five thousand footmen, and a thousand chosen horse, and the army removed by night,
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C4V2">&nbsp;</a>that it might fall upon the army of the Jews and strike them suddenly: and the men of the citadel were
his guides.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C4V3">&nbsp;</a>And Judas heard thereof, and removed, he and the valiant men, that he might strike the king’s host which
was at Emmaus,
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C4V4">&nbsp;</a>while as yet the forces were dispersed from the camp.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C4V5">&nbsp;</a>And Gorgias came into the camp of Judas by night, and found no man; and he sought them in the mountains;
for he said, These men flee from us.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C4V6">&nbsp;</a>And as soon as it was day, Judas appeared in the plain with three thousand men: howbeit they had not
armor nor swords to their minds.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C4V7">&nbsp;</a>And they saw the camp of the Gentiles strong
<span class="add">and
</span> fortified, and horsemen compassing it round about; and these were expert in war.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C4V8">&nbsp;</a>And Judas said to the men that were with him, Fear you⌃ not their multitude, neither be you⌃ afraid of
their onset.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C4V9">&nbsp;</a>Remember how our fathers were saved in the Red sea, when Pharaoh pursued them with a host.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C4V10">&nbsp;</a>And now let us cry to heaven, if he will have us, and will remember the covenant of our fathers, and
destroy this army before our face today:
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C4V11">&nbsp;</a>and all the Gentiles shall know that there is one who redeemeth and saves Israel.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C4V12">&nbsp;</a>And the strangers lifted up their eyes, and saw them coming over against them:
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C4V13">&nbsp;</a>and they went out of the camp to battle. And they that were with Judas sounded their trumpets,
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C4V14">&nbsp;</a>and joined battle, and the Gentiles were discomfited, and fled into the plain.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C4V15">&nbsp;</a>But all the hindmost fell by the sword: and they pursued them to
<a href="#FN1"><span class="notemark">*</span><span class="popup">Gr.
Gazera.
</span></a>
 Gazara, and to the plains of Idumaea and Azotus and Jamnia, and there fell of them about three thousand
men.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C4V16">&nbsp;</a>And Judas and his host returned from pursuing after them,
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C4V17">&nbsp;</a>and he said to the people, Be not greedy of the spoils, inasmuch as there is a battle before us;
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C4V18">&nbsp;</a>and Gorgias and his host are near to us in the mountain. But stand you⌃ now against our enemies, and
fight against them, and afterwards take the spoils with boldness.
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C4V19">&nbsp;</a>While Judas was yet making an end of these words, there appeared a part of them looking out from the
mountain:
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C4V20">&nbsp;</a>and they saw that their host had been put to flight, and that the Jews were burning the camp; for the
smoke that was seen declared what was done.
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C4V21">&nbsp;</a>But when they perceived these things, they were sore afraid; and perceiving also the army of Judas in
the plain ready for battle,
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C4V22">&nbsp;</a>they fled all of them into the land of the
<a href="#FN2"><span class="notemark">†</span><span class="popup">Gr.

</span></a>
 Philistines.
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C4V23">&nbsp;</a>And Judas returned to spoil the camp, and they got much gold, and silver, and blue, and sea purple, and
great riches.
 <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C4V24">&nbsp;</a>And they returned home, and sang a song of thanksgiving, and gave praise
<a href="#FN3"><span class="notemark">‡</span><span class="popup">Or, looking up

</span></a>
 to heaven; because
<span class="add">his mercy
</span> is good, because his mercy endures for ever.
 <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C4V25">&nbsp;</a>And Israel had a great deliverance that day.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C4V26">&nbsp;</a>But the strangers, as many as had escaped, came and told Lysias all the things that had happened:
 <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C4V27">&nbsp;</a>but when he heard thereof, he was confounded and discouraged, because neither had such things as he would
been done to Israel, nor had such things as the king commanded him come to pass.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C4V28">&nbsp;</a>And in the next year he gathered together threescore thousand chosen footmen, and five thousand horse,
that he might subdue them.
 <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C4V29">&nbsp;</a>And they came into Idumaea, and encamped at Bethsura; and Judas met them with ten thousand men.
 <span class="verse"> 30</span><a name="C4V30">&nbsp;</a>And he saw that the army was strong, and he prayed and said,
</div>
<div class="p">Blessed are you, O Saviour of Israel, who did quell the onset of the mighty man by the hand of your servant
David, and did deliver the army of the
<a href="#FN4"><span class="notemark">§</span><span class="popup">Gr.
strangers.
</span></a>
 Philistines into the hands of Jonathan the son of Saul, and of his armor bearer:
 <span class="verse"> 31</span><a name="C4V31">&nbsp;</a>shut up this army in the hand of your people Israel, and let them be ashamed for their host and their
horsemen:
 <span class="verse"> 32</span><a name="C4V32">&nbsp;</a>give them faintness of heart, and cause the boldness of their strength to melt away, and let them quake
at their destruction:
 <span class="verse"> 33</span><a name="C4V33">&nbsp;</a>cast them down with the sword of them that love you, and let all that know your name praise you with
thanksgiving.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 34</span><a name="C4V34">&nbsp;</a>And they joined battle; and there fell of the army of Lysias about five thousand men, and they fell down
over against them.
 <span class="verse"> 35</span><a name="C4V35">&nbsp;</a>But when Lysias saw that his array was put to flight, and the boldness that had come upon them that were
with Judas, and how they were ready either to live or to die nobly, he removed to Antioch, and gathered
together hired soldiers, that he might come again into Judaea with even a greater company.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 36</span><a name="C4V36">&nbsp;</a>But Judas and his brethren said, Behold, our enemies are discomfited: let us go up to cleanse the holy
place, and to dedicate it afresh.
 <span class="verse"> 37</span><a name="C4V37">&nbsp;</a>And all the army was gathered together, and they went up to mount Sion.
 <span class="verse"> 38</span><a name="C4V38">&nbsp;</a>And they saw the sanctuary laid desolate, and the altar profaned, and the gates burned up, and shrubs
growing in the courts as in a forest or as on one of the mountains, and the priests’ chambers pulled
down;
 <span class="verse"> 39</span><a name="C4V39">&nbsp;</a>and they tore their clothes, and made great lamentation, and put ashes upon their heads,
 <span class="verse"> 40</span><a name="C4V40">&nbsp;</a>and fell on their faces to the ground, and
<a href="#FN5"><span class="notemark">**</span><span class="popup">Compare Numbers 31:6.
</span></a>
 blew with the
<a href="#FN6"><span class="notemark">††</span><span class="popup">Gr.
trumpets of signals.
</span></a>
 solemn trumpets, and cried toward heaven.
 <span class="verse"> 41</span><a name="C4V41">&nbsp;</a>Then Judas appointed certain men to fight against those that were in the citadel, until he should have
cleansed the holy place.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 42</span><a name="C4V42">&nbsp;</a>And he chose blameless priests, such as had pleasure in the law:
 <span class="verse"> 43</span><a name="C4V43">&nbsp;</a>and they cleansed the holy place, and bare out the stones of defilement into an unclean place.
 <span class="verse"> 44</span><a name="C4V44">&nbsp;</a>And they took counsel concerning the altar of burnt offerings, which had been profaned, what they should
do with it:
 <span class="verse"> 45</span><a name="C4V45">&nbsp;</a>and there came into their mind a good counsel, that they should pull it down, lest it should be a reproach
to them, because the Gentiles had defiled it: and they pulled down the altar,
 <span class="verse"> 46</span><a name="C4V46">&nbsp;</a>and laid up the stones in the mountain of the house in a convenient place, until there should come a
prophet to give an answer concerning them.
 <span class="verse"> 47</span><a name="C4V47">&nbsp;</a>And they took whole stones according to the law, and built a new altar after the fashion of the former;
 <span class="verse"> 48</span><a name="C4V48">&nbsp;</a>and they built the holy place, and the inner parts of the house; and they hallowed the courts.
 <span class="verse"> 49</span><a name="C4V49">&nbsp;</a>And they made the holy vessels new, and they brought the candlestick, and the altar of burnt offerings
and of incense, and the table, into the temple.
 <span class="verse"> 50</span><a name="C4V50">&nbsp;</a>And they burned incense upon the altar, and they lighted the lamps that were upon the candlestick, and
they gave light in the temple.
 <span class="verse"> 51</span><a name="C4V51">&nbsp;</a>And they set loaves upon the table, and spread out the veils, and finished all the works which they made.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 52</span><a name="C4V52">&nbsp;</a>And they rose up early in the morning, on the five and twentieth day of the ninth month, which is the
month Chislev, in
<a href="#FN7"><span class="notemark">‡‡</span><span class="popup">circa B.C 165.
</span></a>
 the hundred and forty and eighth year,
 <span class="verse"> 53</span><a name="C4V53">&nbsp;</a>and offered sacrifice according to the law upon the new altar of burned offerings which they had made.
 <span class="verse"> 54</span><a name="C4V54">&nbsp;</a>At what time and on what day the Gentiles had profaned it, even on that
<span class="add">day
</span> was it dedicated afresh, with songs and harps and lutes, and with cymbals.
 <span class="verse"> 55</span><a name="C4V55">&nbsp;</a>And all the people fell upon their faces, and worshipped, and
<a href="#FN8"><span class="notemark">§§</span><span class="popup">Or,
gave praise,
looking up
to heaven, to him which
</span></a>
 gave praise to heaven, which had given them good success.
 <span class="verse"> 56</span><a name="C4V56">&nbsp;</a>And they kept the dedication of the altar eight days, and offered burned offerings with gladness, and
sacrificed a sacrifice of deliverance and praise.
 <span class="verse"> 57</span><a name="C4V57">&nbsp;</a>And they decked the forefront of the temple with crowns of gold and small shields, and dedicated afresh
the gates and the priests’ chambers, and made doors for them.
 <span class="verse"> 58</span><a name="C4V58">&nbsp;</a>And there was exceeding great gladness among the people, and the reproach of the Gentiles was turned
away.
 <span class="verse"> 59</span><a name="C4V59">&nbsp;</a>And Judas and his brethren and the whole congregation of Israel ordained, that the days of the dedication
of the altar should be kept in their seasons from year to year by the space of eight days, from the five
and twentieth day of the month Chislev, with gladness and joy.
 <span class="verse"> 60</span><a name="C4V60">&nbsp;</a>And at that season they builded up the mount Sion with high walls and strong towers round about, lest
haply the Gentiles should come and tread them down, as they had done aforetime.
 <span class="verse"> 61</span><a name="C4V61">&nbsp;</a>And he set there a force to keep it, and they fortified Bethsura to keep it; that the people might have
a stronghold over against Idumaea.
