that you shall set yourself up great stones, and coat them with plaster.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C27V3">&nbsp;</a>You shall write on them all the words of this law, when you have passed over; that you may go in to the
land which Yahweh your God gives you, a land flowing with milk and honey, as Yahweh, the God of your
fathers, has promised you.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C27V4">&nbsp;</a>It shall be, when you have crossed over the Jordan, that you shall set up these stones, which I command
you today, on Mount Ebal, and you shall coat them with plaster.
