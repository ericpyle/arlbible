 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C3V1">&nbsp;</a>Therefore, holy brothers, partakers of a heavenly calling, consider the Apostle and High Priest of our
confession, Jesus;
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C3V2">&nbsp;</a>who was faithful to him who appointed him, as also was Moses in all his house.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C3V3">&nbsp;</a>For he has been counted worthy of more glory than Moses, because he who built the house has more honor
than the house.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C3V4">&nbsp;</a>For every house is built by someone; but he who built all things is God.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C3V5">&nbsp;</a>Moses indeed was faithful in all his house as a servant, for a testimony of those things which were afterward
to be spoken,
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C3V6">&nbsp;</a>but Christ is faithful as a Son over his house; whose house we are, if we hold fast our confidence and
the glorying of our hope firm to the end.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C3V7">&nbsp;</a>Therefore, even as the Holy Spirit says,
</div>
<div class="q1">“Today if you will hear his voice,
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C3V8">&nbsp;</a>don’t harden your hearts, as in the rebellion,
</div>
<div class="q2">like as in the day of the trial in the wilderness,
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C3V9">&nbsp;</a>where your fathers tested me by proving me,
</div>
<div class="q2">and saw my deeds for forty years.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C3V10">&nbsp;</a>Therefore I was displeased with that generation,
</div>
<div class="q2">and said, ‘They always err in their heart,
</div>
<div class="q2">but they didn’t know my ways;’
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C3V11">&nbsp;</a>as I swore in my wrath,
</div>
<div class="q2">‘They will not enter into my rest.’”<a href="#FN1"><span class="notemark"></span><span class="popup">+ Psalm 95:7-11</span></a>
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C3V12">&nbsp;</a>Beware, brothers, lest perhaps there be in any one of you an evil heart of unbelief, in falling away
from the living God;
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C3V13">&nbsp;</a>but exhort one another day by day, so long as it is called “today”; lest any one of you be hardened by
the deceitfulness of sin.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C3V14">&nbsp;</a>For we have become partakers of Christ, if we hold fast the beginning of our confidence firm to the end:
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C3V15">&nbsp;</a>while it is said,
</div>
<div class="q1">“Today if you will hear his voice,
</div>
<div class="q2">don’t harden your hearts, as in the rebellion.”<a href="#FN2"><span class="notemark"></span><span class="popup">+ Psalm 95:7-8</span></a>
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C3V16">&nbsp;</a>For who, when they heard, rebelled? No, didn’t all those who came out of Egypt by Moses?
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C3V17">&nbsp;</a>With whom was he displeased forty years? Wasn’t it with those who sinned, whose bodies fell in the wilderness?
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C3V18">&nbsp;</a>To whom did he swear that they wouldn’t enter into his rest, but to those who were disobedient?
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C3V19">&nbsp;</a>We see that they were not able to enter in because of unbelief.
