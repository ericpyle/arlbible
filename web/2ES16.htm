 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C16V1">&nbsp;</a>Woe to you, Babylon, and Asia! woe to you, Egypt, and Syria!
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C16V2">&nbsp;</a>Gird up yourselves with sackcloth and garments of hair, and bewail your children, and lament; for your
destruction is at hand.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C16V3">&nbsp;</a>A sword is sent upon you, and who is he that may turn it back?
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C16V4">&nbsp;</a>A fire is sent upon you, and who is he that may quench it?
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C16V5">&nbsp;</a>Evils are sent upon you, and who is he that may drive them away?
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C16V6">&nbsp;</a>May one drive away a hungry lion in the wood? or may one quench the fire in stubble, when it has once
begun to burn?
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C16V7">&nbsp;</a>May one turn again the arrow that is shot of a strong archer?
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C16V8">&nbsp;</a>The Lord God sends the evils, and who shall drive them away?
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C16V9">&nbsp;</a>A fire shall go forth from his wrath, and who is he that may quench it?
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C16V10">&nbsp;</a>He shall cast lightning, and who shall not fear? he shall thunder, and who shall not tremble?
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C16V11">&nbsp;</a>The Lord shall threaten, and who shall not be utterly broken in pieces at his presence?
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C16V12">&nbsp;</a>The earth quaketh, and the foundations thereof; the sea arises up with waves from the deep, and the waves
of it shall be troubled, and the fishes thereof also, at the presence of the Lord, and before the glory
of his power:
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C16V13">&nbsp;</a>for strong is his right hand that bendeth the bow, his arrows that he shooteth are sharp, and shall not
miss, when they begin to be shot into the ends of the world.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C16V14">&nbsp;</a>Behold, the evils are sent forth, and shall not return again, until they come upon the earth.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C16V15">&nbsp;</a>The fire is kindled, and shall not be put out, till it consume the foundations of the earth.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C16V16">&nbsp;</a>Like as an arrow which is shot of a mighty archer returns not backward, even so the evils that are sent
forth upon earth shall not return again.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C16V17">&nbsp;</a>Woe is me! woe is me! who will deliver me in those days?
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C16V18">&nbsp;</a>The beginning of sorrows, and
<span class="add">there shall be
</span> great mournings; the beginning of famine, and many shall perish; the beginning of wars, and the powers
shall stand in fear; the beginning of evils, and all shall tremble! what shall they do in
<span class="add">all
</span> this when the evils shall come?
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C16V19">&nbsp;</a>Behold, famine and plague, tribulation and anguish! they are sent as scourges for amendment.
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C16V20">&nbsp;</a>But for all these things they shall not turn them from their wickedness, nor be always mindful of the
scourges.
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C16V21">&nbsp;</a>Behold, food shall be so good cheap upon earth, that they shall think themselves to be in good case,
and even then shall evils grow upon earth, sword, famine, and great confusion.
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C16V22">&nbsp;</a>For many of them that dwell upon earth shall perish of famine; and the other, that escape the famine,
shall the sword destroy.
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C16V23">&nbsp;</a>And the dead shall be cast out as dung, and there shall be no man to comfort them: for the earth shall
be left desolate, and the cities thereof shall be cast down.
 <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C16V24">&nbsp;</a>There shall be no husbandman left to till the earth, and to sow it.
 <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C16V25">&nbsp;</a>The trees shall give fruit, and who shall gather them?
 <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C16V26">&nbsp;</a>The grapes shall ripen, and who shall tread them? for in
<span class="add">all
</span> places there shall be a great forsaking:
 <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C16V27">&nbsp;</a>for one man shall desire to see another, or to hear his voice.
 <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C16V28">&nbsp;</a>For of a city there shall be ten left, and two of the field, which have hidden themselves in the thick
groves, and in the clefts of the rocks.
 <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C16V29">&nbsp;</a>As in an orchard of olives upon every tree there be left three or four olives,
 <span class="verse"> 30</span><a name="C16V30">&nbsp;</a>or as when a vineyard is gathered there be some clusters left by them that diligently seek through the
vineyard;
 <span class="verse"> 31</span><a name="C16V31">&nbsp;</a>even so in those days there shall be three or four left by them that search their houses with the sword.
 <span class="verse"> 32</span><a name="C16V32">&nbsp;</a>And the earth shall be left desolate, and the fields thereof shall be for briers, and her ways and all
her paths shall bring forth thorns, because no sheep shall pass therethrough.
 <span class="verse"> 33</span><a name="C16V33">&nbsp;</a>The virgins shall mourn, having no bridegrooms; the women shall mourn, having no husbands; their daughters
shall mourn, having no helpers.
 <span class="verse"> 34</span><a name="C16V34">&nbsp;</a>In the wars shall their bridegrooms be destroyed, and their husbands shall perish of famine.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 35</span><a name="C16V35">&nbsp;</a>Hear now these things, and understand them, you⌃ servants of the Lord.
 <span class="verse"> 36</span><a name="C16V36">&nbsp;</a>Behold, the word of the Lord, receive it: disbelieve not the things whereof the Lord speaks.
 <span class="verse"> 37</span><a name="C16V37">&nbsp;</a>Behold, the evils draw near, and are not slack.
 <span class="verse"> 38</span><a name="C16V38">&nbsp;</a>Like as a woman with child in the ninth month, when the hour of her delivery draweth near, within two
or three hours doleful pains compass her womb, and when the child comes forth from the womb, there shall
be no tarrying for a moment:
 <span class="verse"> 39</span><a name="C16V39">&nbsp;</a>even so shall not the evils be slack to come upon the earth, and the world shall groan, and sorrows shall
take hold of it on every side.
 <span class="verse"> 40</span><a name="C16V40">&nbsp;</a>O my people, hear my word: make you ready to the battle, and in those evils be even as pilgrims upon
the earth.
 <span class="verse"> 41</span><a name="C16V41">&nbsp;</a>He that selleth, let him be as he that fleeth away: and he that buys, as one that will lose:
 <span class="verse"> 42</span><a name="C16V42">&nbsp;</a>he that occupieth merchandise, as he that has no profit by it: and he that builds, as he that shall not
dwell therein:
 <span class="verse"> 43</span><a name="C16V43">&nbsp;</a>he that sows, as if he should not reap: so also he that pruneth
<span class="add">the vines,
</span> as he that shall not gather the grapes:
 <span class="verse"> 44</span><a name="C16V44">&nbsp;</a>they that marry, as they that shall get no children; and they that marry not, as the widowed.
 <span class="verse"> 45</span><a name="C16V45">&nbsp;</a>Inasmuch as they that labor labor in vain;
 <span class="verse"> 46</span><a name="C16V46">&nbsp;</a>for strangers shall reap their fruits, and spoil their goods, overthrow their houses, and take their
children captive, for in captivity and famine shall they beget their children:
 <span class="verse"> 47</span><a name="C16V47">&nbsp;</a>and they that traffick traffick to become a spoil: the more they deck their cities, their houses, their
possessions, and their own persons,
 <span class="verse"> 48</span><a name="C16V48">&nbsp;</a>the more will I hate them for their sins, says the Lord.
 <span class="verse"> 49</span><a name="C16V49">&nbsp;</a>Like as a right honest and virtuous woman hates a harlot,
 <span class="verse"> 50</span><a name="C16V50">&nbsp;</a>so shall righteousness hate iniquity, when she decketh herself, and shall accuse her to her face, when
he comes that shall defend him that diligently searcheth out every sin upon earth.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 51</span><a name="C16V51">&nbsp;</a>Therefore be you⌃ not like thereto, nor to the works thereof.
 <span class="verse"> 52</span><a name="C16V52">&nbsp;</a>For yet a little while, and iniquity shall be taken away out of the earth, and righteousness shall reign
over us.
 <span class="verse"> 53</span><a name="C16V53">&nbsp;</a>Let not the sinner say that he has not sinned: for he shall burn coals of fire upon his head, which says,
I have not sinned before God and his glory.
 <span class="verse"> 54</span><a name="C16V54">&nbsp;</a>Behold, the Lord knows all the works of men, their imaginations, their thoughts, and their hearts.
 <span class="verse"> 55</span><a name="C16V55">&nbsp;</a>Who said, Let the earth be made; and it was made: Let the heaven be made; and it was made.
 <span class="verse"> 56</span><a name="C16V56">&nbsp;</a>And at his word were the stars established, and he knows the number of the stars.
 <span class="verse"> 57</span><a name="C16V57">&nbsp;</a>Who searcheth the deep, and the treasures thereof; he has measured the sea, and what it contains.
 <span class="verse"> 58</span><a name="C16V58">&nbsp;</a>Who has shut the sea in the midst of the waters, and with his word has he hanged the earth upon the waters.
 <span class="verse"> 59</span><a name="C16V59">&nbsp;</a>Who spreadeth out the heaven like a vault; upon the waters has he founded it.
 <span class="verse"> 60</span><a name="C16V60">&nbsp;</a>Who has made in the desert springs of water, and pools upon the tops of the mountains, to send forth
rivers from the height to water the earth.
 <span class="verse"> 61</span><a name="C16V61">&nbsp;</a>Who framed man, and put a heart in the midst of the body, and gave him breath, life, and understanding,
 <span class="verse"> 62</span><a name="C16V62">&nbsp;</a>yes, the spirit of God Almighty. He who made all things, and searcheth out hidden things in hidden places,
 <span class="verse"> 63</span><a name="C16V63">&nbsp;</a>surely he knows your imagination, and what you⌃ think in your hearts. Woe to them that sin, and would
fain hide their sin!
 <span class="verse"> 64</span><a name="C16V64">&nbsp;</a>Forasmuch as the Lord will exactly search out all your works, and he will put you all to shame.
 <span class="verse"> 65</span><a name="C16V65">&nbsp;</a>And when your sins are brought forth before men, you⌃ shall be ashamed, and your own iniquities shall
stand as your accusers in that day.
 <span class="verse"> 66</span><a name="C16V66">&nbsp;</a>What will you⌃ do? or how will you⌃ hide your sins before God and his angels?
 <span class="verse"> 67</span><a name="C16V67">&nbsp;</a>Behold, God is the judge, fear him: leave off from your sins, and forget your iniquities, to meddle no
more with them for ever: so shall God lead you forth, and deliver you from all tribulation.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 68</span><a name="C16V68">&nbsp;</a>For, behold, the burning wrath of a great multitude is kindled over you, and they shall take away certain
of you, and feed you with that which is slain to idols.
 <span class="verse"> 69</span><a name="C16V69">&nbsp;</a>And they that consent to them shall be had in derision and in reproach, and be trodden under foot of
them.
 <span class="verse"> 70</span><a name="C16V70">&nbsp;</a>For there shall be
<a href="#FN1"><span class="notemark">*</span><span class="popup">The Latin is uncertain.
</span></a>
 in various places, and in the next cities, a great insurrection upon those that fear the Lord.
 <span class="verse"> 71</span><a name="C16V71">&nbsp;</a>They shall be like mad men, sparing none, but spoiling and destroying them that still fear the Lord.
 <span class="verse"> 72</span><a name="C16V72">&nbsp;</a>For they shall waste and take away their goods, and cast them out of their houses.
 <span class="verse"> 73</span><a name="C16V73">&nbsp;</a>Then shall be manifest the trial of mine elect; even as the gold that is tried in the fire.
 <span class="verse"> 74</span><a name="C16V74">&nbsp;</a>Hear, O you⌃ mine elect, says the Lord: behold, the days of tribulation are at hand, and I will deliver
you from them.
 <span class="verse"> 75</span><a name="C16V75">&nbsp;</a>Be you⌃ not afraid, neither doubt; for God is your guide:
 <span class="verse"> 76</span><a name="C16V76">&nbsp;</a>and you⌃ who keep my commandments and precepts, says the Lord God, let not your sins weigh you down,
and let not your iniquities lift up themselves.
 <span class="verse"> 77</span><a name="C16V77">&nbsp;</a>Woe to them that are fast bound with their sins, and covered with their iniquities, like as a field is
fast bound with bushes, and the path thereof covered with thorns, that no man may travel through!
