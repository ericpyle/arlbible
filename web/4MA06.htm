 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C6V1">&nbsp;</a>When Eleazar had in this manner answered the exhortations of the tyrant, the spearbearers came up, and
rudely haled Eleazar to the instruments of torture.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C6V2">&nbsp;</a>And first, they stripped the old man, adorned as he was with the comeliness of piety.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C6V3">&nbsp;</a>Then tying back his arms and hands, they disdainfully used him with stripes;
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C6V4">&nbsp;</a>a herald opposite crying out, Obey the commands of the king.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C6V5">&nbsp;</a>But Eleazar, the high-minded and truly noble, as one tortured in a dream, regarded it not all.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C6V6">&nbsp;</a>But raising his eyes on high to heaven, the old man’s flesh was stripped off by the scourges, and his
blood streamed down, and his sides were pierced through.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C6V7">&nbsp;</a>And falling upon the ground, from his body having no power to support the pains, he yet kept his reasoning
upright and unbending.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C6V8">&nbsp;</a>then one of the harsh spearbearers leaped upon his belly as he was falling, to force him upright.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C6V9">&nbsp;</a>But he endured the pains, and despised the cruelty, and persevered through the indignities;
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C6V10">&nbsp;</a>and like a noble athlete, the old man, when struck, vanquished his torturers.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C6V11">&nbsp;</a>His countenance sweating, and he panting for breath, he was admired by the very torturers for his courage.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C6V12">&nbsp;</a>Wherefore, partly in pity for his old age,
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C6V13">&nbsp;</a>partly from the sympathy of acquaintance, and partly in admiration of his endurance, some of the attendants
of the king said,
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C6V14">&nbsp;</a>Why do you unreasonably destroy yourself, O Eleazar, with these miseries?
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C6V15">&nbsp;</a>We will bring you some meat cooked by yourself, and do you save yourself by pretending that you have
eaten swine’s flesh.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C6V16">&nbsp;</a>And Eleazar, as though the advice more painfully tortured him, cried out,
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C6V17">&nbsp;</a>Let not us who are children of Abraham be so evil advised as by giving way to make use of an unbecoming
pretense;
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C6V18">&nbsp;</a>for it were irrational, if having lived up to old age in all truth, and having scrupulously guarded our
character for it, we should now turn back,
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C6V19">&nbsp;</a>and ourselves should become a pattern of impiety to the young, as being an example of pollution eating.
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C6V20">&nbsp;</a>It would be disgraceful if we should live on some short time, and that scorned by all men for cowardice,
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C6V21">&nbsp;</a>and be condemned by the tyrant for unmanliness, by not contending to the death for our divine law.
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C6V22">&nbsp;</a>Wherefore do you, O children of Abraham, die nobly for your religion.
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C6V23">&nbsp;</a>You⌃ spearbearers of the tyrant, why do you⌃ linger?
 <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C6V24">&nbsp;</a>Beholding him so high-minded against misery, and not changing at their pity, they led him to the fire:
 <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C6V25">&nbsp;</a>then with their wickedly contrived instruments they burned him on the fire, and poured stinking fluids
down into his nostrils.
 <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C6V26">&nbsp;</a>And he being at length burned down to the bones, and about to expire, raised his eyes Godward, and said,
 <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C6V27">&nbsp;</a>You know, O God, that when I might have been saved, I am slain for the sake of the law by tortures of
fire.
 <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C6V28">&nbsp;</a>Be merciful to your people, and be satisfied with the punishment of me on their account.
 <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C6V29">&nbsp;</a>Let my blood be a purification for them, and take my life in recompense for theirs.
 <span class="verse"> 30</span><a name="C6V30">&nbsp;</a>Thus speaking, the holy man departed, noble in his torments, and even to the agonies of death resisted
in his reasoning for the sake of the law.
 <span class="verse"> 31</span><a name="C6V31">&nbsp;</a>Confessedly, therefore, religious reasoning is master of the passions.
 <span class="verse"> 32</span><a name="C6V32">&nbsp;</a>For had the passions been superior to reasoning, I would have given them the witness of this mastery.
 <span class="verse"> 33</span><a name="C6V33">&nbsp;</a>But now, since reasoning conquered the passions, we befittingly awared it the authority of first place.
 <span class="verse"> 34</span><a name="C6V34">&nbsp;</a>And it is but fair that we should allow, that the power belongs to reasoning, since it masters external
miseries.
 <span class="verse"> 35</span><a name="C6V35">&nbsp;</a>Ridiculous would it be were it not so; and I prove that reasoning has not only mastered pains, but that
it is also superior to the pleasures, and withstands them.
