<div class="chapterlabel"> 7</div><div class="q1">
 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C7V1">&nbsp;</a>Misery is mine!
</div>
<div class="q2">Indeed, I am like one who gathers the summer fruits, as gleanings of the vineyard:
</div>
<div class="q2">There is no cluster of grapes to eat.
</div>
<div class="q2">My soul desires to eat the early fig.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C7V2">&nbsp;</a>The godly man has perished out of the earth,
</div>
<div class="q2">and there is no one upright among men.
</div>
<div class="q2">They all lie in wait for blood;
</div>
<div class="q2">every man hunts his brother with a net.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C7V3">&nbsp;</a>Their hands are on that which is evil to do it diligently.
</div>
<div class="q2">The ruler and judge ask for a bribe;
</div>
<div class="q2">and the powerful man dictates the evil desire of his soul.
</div>
<div class="q2">Thus they conspire together.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C7V4">&nbsp;</a>The best of them is like a brier.
</div>
<div class="q2">The most upright is worse than a thorn hedge.
</div>
<div class="q1">The day of your watchmen,
</div>
<div class="q2">even your visitation, has come;
</div>
<div class="q2">now is the time of their confusion.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C7V5">&nbsp;</a>Don’t trust in a neighbor.
</div>
<div class="q2">Don’t put confidence in a friend.
</div>
<div class="q2">With the woman lying in your embrace,
</div>
<div class="q2">be careful of the words of your mouth!
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C7V6">&nbsp;</a>For the son dishonors the father,
</div>
<div class="q2">the daughter rises up against her mother,
</div>
<div class="q2">the daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law;
</div>
<div class="q2">a man’s enemies are the men of his own house.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C7V7">&nbsp;</a>But as for me, I will look to Yahweh.
</div>
<div class="q2">I will wait for the God of my salvation.
</div>
<div class="q2">My God will hear me.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C7V8">&nbsp;</a>Don’t rejoice against me, my enemy.
</div>
<div class="q2">When I fall, I will arise.
</div>
<div class="q2">When I sit in darkness, Yahweh will be a light to me.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C7V9">&nbsp;</a>I will bear the indignation of Yahweh,
</div>
<div class="q2">because I have sinned against him,
</div>
<div class="q2">until he pleads my case, and executes judgment for me.
</div>
<div class="q2">He will bring me out to the light.
</div>
<div class="q2">I will see his righteousness.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C7V10">&nbsp;</a>Then my enemy will see it,
</div>
<div class="q2">and shame will cover her who said to me,
</div>
<div class="q2">where is Yahweh your God?
</div>
<div class="q1">Then my enemy will see me and will cover her shame.
</div>
<div class="q2">Now she will be trodden down like the mire of the streets.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C7V11">&nbsp;</a>A day to build your walls—
</div>
<div class="q2">In that day, he will extend your boundary.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C7V12">&nbsp;</a>In that day they will come to you from Assyria and the cities of Egypt,
</div>
<div class="q2">and from Egypt even to the River,
</div>
<div class="q2">and from sea to sea,
</div>
<div class="q2">and mountain to mountain.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C7V13">&nbsp;</a>Yet the land will be desolate because of those who dwell therein,
</div>
<div class="q2">for the fruit of their doings.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C7V14">&nbsp;</a>Shepherd your people with your staff,
</div>
<div class="q2">the flock of your heritage,
</div>
<div class="q2">who dwell by themselves in a forest,
</div>
<div class="q2">in the middle of fertile pasture land, let them feed;
</div>
<div class="q2">in Bashan and Gilead, as in the days of old.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C7V15">&nbsp;</a>“As in the days of your coming out of the land of Egypt,
</div>
<div class="q2">I will show them marvelous things.”
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C7V16">&nbsp;</a>The nations will see and be ashamed of all their might.
</div>
<div class="q2">They will lay their hand on their mouth.
</div>
<div class="q2">Their ears will be deaf.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C7V17">&nbsp;</a>They will lick the dust like a serpent.
</div>
<div class="q2">Like crawling things of the earth they shall come trembling out of their dens.
</div>
<div class="q2">They will come with fear to Yahweh our God,
</div>
<div class="q2">and will be afraid because of you.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C7V18">&nbsp;</a>Who is a God like you, who pardons iniquity,
</div>
<div class="q2">and passes over the disobedience of the remnant of his heritage?
</div>
<div class="q1">He doesn’t retain his anger forever,
</div>
<div class="q2">because he delights in loving kindness.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C7V19">&nbsp;</a>He will again have compassion on us.
</div>
<div class="q2">He will tread our iniquities under foot;
</div>
<div class="q2">and you will cast all their sins into the depths of the sea.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C7V20">&nbsp;</a>You will give truth to Jacob,
</div>
<div class="q2">and mercy to Abraham,
</div>
<div class="q2">as you have sworn to our fathers from the days of old.
