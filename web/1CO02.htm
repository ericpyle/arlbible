 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C2V1">&nbsp;</a>When I came to you, brothers, I didn’t come with excellence of speech or of wisdom, proclaiming to you
the testimony of God.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C2V2">&nbsp;</a>For I determined not to know anything among you, except Jesus Christ, and him crucified.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C2V3">&nbsp;</a>I was with you in weakness, in fear, and in much trembling.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C2V4">&nbsp;</a>My speech and my preaching were not in persuasive words of human wisdom, but in demonstration of the
Spirit and of power,
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C2V5">&nbsp;</a>that your faith wouldn’t stand in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C2V6">&nbsp;</a>We speak wisdom, however, among those who are full grown; yet a wisdom not of this world, nor of the
rulers of this world, who are coming to nothing.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C2V7">&nbsp;</a>But we speak God’s wisdom in a mystery, the wisdom that has been hidden, which God foreordained before
the worlds for our glory,
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C2V8">&nbsp;</a>which none of the rulers of this world has known. For had they known it, they wouldn’t have crucified
the Lord of glory.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C2V9">&nbsp;</a>But as it is written,
</div>
<div class="q1">“Things which an eye didn’t see, and an ear didn’t hear,
</div>
<div class="q2">which didn’t enter into the heart of man,
</div>
<div class="q1">these God has prepared for those who love him.”<a href="#FN1"><span class="notemark"></span><span class="popup">+ Isaiah 64:4</span></a>
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C2V10">&nbsp;</a>But to us, God revealed them through the Spirit. For the Spirit searches all things, yes, the deep things
of God.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C2V11">&nbsp;</a>For who among men knows the things of a man, except the spirit of the man, which is in him? Even so,
no one knows the things of God, except God’s Spirit.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C2V12">&nbsp;</a>But we received, not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit which is from God, that we might know the
things that were freely given to us by God.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C2V13">&nbsp;</a>Which things also we speak, not in words which man’s wisdom teaches, but which the Holy Spirit teaches,
comparing spiritual things with spiritual things.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C2V14">&nbsp;</a>Now the natural man doesn’t receive the things of God’s Spirit, for they are foolishness to him, and
he can’t know them, because they are spiritually discerned.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C2V15">&nbsp;</a>But he who is spiritual discerns all things, and he himself is judged by no one.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C2V16">&nbsp;</a>“For who has known the mind of the Lord, that he should instruct him?”

 But we have Christ’s mind.
