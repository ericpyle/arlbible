<div class="chapterlabel"> 2</div><div class="p">
 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C2V1">&nbsp;</a>My brothers, don’t hold the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ of glory with partiality.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C2V2">&nbsp;</a>For if a man with a gold ring, in fine clothing, comes into your synagogue,<a href="#FN1"><span class="notemark">*</span><span class="popup">or, meeting</span></a>
 and a poor man in filthy clothing also comes in;
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C2V3">&nbsp;</a>and you pay special attention to him who wears the fine clothing, and say, “Sit here in a good place”;
and you tell the poor man, “Stand there,” or “Sit by my footstool”;
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C2V4">&nbsp;</a>haven’t you shown partiality among yourselves, and become judges with evil thoughts?
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C2V5">&nbsp;</a>Listen, my beloved brothers. Didn’t God choose those who are poor in this world to be rich in faith,
and heirs of the Kingdom which he promised to those who love him?
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C2V6">&nbsp;</a>But you have dishonored the poor man. Don’t the rich oppress you, and personally drag you before the
courts?
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C2V7">&nbsp;</a>Don’t they blaspheme the honorable name by which you are called?
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C2V8">&nbsp;</a>However, if you fulfill the royal law, according to the Scripture, “You shall love your neighbor as yourself,”<a href="#FN2"><span class="notemark"></span><span class="popup">+ Leviticus 19:18</span></a>
 you do well.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C2V9">&nbsp;</a>But if you show partiality, you commit sin, being convicted by the law as transgressors.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C2V10">&nbsp;</a>For whoever keeps the whole law, and yet stumbles in one point, he has become guilty of all.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C2V11">&nbsp;</a>For he who said, “Do not commit adultery,”<a href="#FN3"><span class="notemark"></span><span class="popup">+ Exodus 20:14; Deuteronomy 5:18</span></a>
 also said, “Do not commit murder.”<a href="#FN4"><span class="notemark"></span><span class="popup">+ Exodus 10:13; Deuteronomy 5:17
</span></a>
 Now if you do not commit adultery, but murder, you have become a transgressor of the law.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C2V12">&nbsp;</a>So speak, and so do, as men who are to be judged by a law of freedom.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C2V13">&nbsp;</a>For judgment is without mercy to him who has shown no mercy. Mercy triumphs over judgment.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C2V14">&nbsp;</a>What good is it, my brothers, if a man says he has faith, but has no works? Can faith save him?
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C2V15">&nbsp;</a>And if a brother or sister is naked and in lack of daily food,
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C2V16">&nbsp;</a>and one of you tells them, “Go in peace, be warmed and filled”; and yet you didn’t give them the things
the body needs, what good is it?
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C2V17">&nbsp;</a>Even so faith, if it has no works, is dead in itself.
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C2V18">&nbsp;</a>Yes, a man will say, “You have faith, and I have works.” Show me your faith without works, and I by my
works will show you my faith.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C2V19">&nbsp;</a>You believe that God is one. You do well. The demons also believe, and shudder.
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C2V20">&nbsp;</a>But do you want to know, vain man, that faith apart from works is dead?
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C2V21">&nbsp;</a>Wasn’t Abraham our father justified by works, in that he offered up Isaac his son on the altar?
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C2V22">&nbsp;</a>You see that faith worked with his works, and by works faith was perfected;
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C2V23">&nbsp;</a>and the Scripture was fulfilled which says, “Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him as righteousness”;<a href="#FN5"><span class="notemark"></span><span class="popup">+ Genesis 15:6</span></a>
 and he was called the friend of God.
 <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C2V24">&nbsp;</a>You see then that by works, a man is justified, and not only by faith.
 <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C2V25">&nbsp;</a>In the same way, wasn’t Rahab the prostitute also justified by works, in that she received the messengers,
and sent them out another way?
 <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C2V26">&nbsp;</a>For as the body apart from the spirit is dead, even so faith apart from works is dead.
