mother’s name was Jerushah the daughter of Zadok.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C27V2">&nbsp;</a>He did that which was right in Yahweh’s eyes, according to all that his father Uzziah had done. However
he didn’t enter into Yahweh’s temple. The people still acted corruptly.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C27V3">&nbsp;</a>He built the upper gate of Yahweh’s house, and he built much on the wall of Ophel.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C27V4">&nbsp;</a>Moreover he built cities in the hill country of Judah, and in the forests he built fortresses and towers.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C27V5">&nbsp;</a>He also fought with the king of the children of Ammon, and prevailed against them. The children of Ammon
gave him the same year one hundred talents<a href="#FN1"><span class="notemark">*</span><span class="popup">A talent is about 30 kilograms or 66 pounds</span></a>

 The children of Ammon also gave that much to him in the second year, and in the third.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C27V6">&nbsp;</a>So Jotham became mighty, because he ordered his ways before Yahweh his God.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C27V7">&nbsp;</a>Now the rest of the acts of Jotham, and all his wars, and his ways, behold, they are written in the book
of the kings of Israel and Judah.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C27V8">&nbsp;</a>He was five and twenty years old when he began to reign, and reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C27V9">&nbsp;</a>Jotham slept with his fathers, and they buried him in David’s city; and Ahaz his son reigned in his place.
