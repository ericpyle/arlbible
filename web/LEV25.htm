 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C25V1">&nbsp;</a>Yahweh said to Moses in Mount Sinai,
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C25V2">&nbsp;</a>“Speak to the children of Israel, and tell them, ‘When you come into the land which I give you, then
the land shall keep a Sabbath to Yahweh.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C25V3">&nbsp;</a>You shall sow your field six years, and you shall prune your vineyard six years, and gather in its fruits;
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C25V4">&nbsp;</a>but in the seventh year there shall be a Sabbath of solemn rest for the land, a Sabbath to Yahweh. You
shall not sow your field or prune your vineyard.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C25V5">&nbsp;</a>What grows of itself in your harvest you shall not reap, and you shall not gather the grapes of your
undressed vine. It shall be a year of solemn rest for the land.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C25V6">&nbsp;</a>The Sabbath of the land shall be for food for you; for yourself, for your servant, for your maid, for
your hired servant, and for your stranger, who lives as a foreigner with you.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C25V7">&nbsp;</a>For your livestock also, and for the animals that are in your land, shall all its increase be for food.

days of seven Sabbaths of years, even forty-nine years.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C25V9">&nbsp;</a>Then you shall sound the loud trumpet on the tenth day of the seventh month. On the Day of Atonement
you shall sound the trumpet throughout all your land.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C25V10">&nbsp;</a>You shall make the fiftieth year holy, and proclaim liberty throughout the land to all its inhabitants.
It shall be a jubilee to you; and each of you shall return to his own property, and each of you shall
return to his family.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C25V11">&nbsp;</a>That fiftieth year shall be a jubilee to you. In it you shall not sow, neither reap that which grows
of itself, nor gather from the undressed vines.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C25V12">&nbsp;</a>For it is a jubilee; it shall be holy to you. You shall eat of its increase out of the field.

number of years of the crops he shall sell to you.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C25V16">&nbsp;</a>According to the length of the years you shall increase its price, and according to the shortness of
the years you shall diminish its price; for he is selling the number of the crops to you.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C25V17">&nbsp;</a>You shall not wrong one another; but you shall fear your God: for I am Yahweh your God.

 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C25V21">&nbsp;</a>then I will command my blessing on you in the sixth year, and it shall bear fruit for the three years.
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C25V22">&nbsp;</a>You shall sow the eighth year, and eat of the fruits, the old store; until the ninth year, until its
fruits come in, you shall eat the old store.

shall come, and redeem that which his brother has sold.

 <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C25V27">&nbsp;</a>then let him reckon the years since its sale, and restore the surplus to the man to whom he sold it;
and he shall return to his property.

who has bought it until the Year of Jubilee: and in the Jubilee it shall be released, and he shall return
to his property.

<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C25V29">&nbsp;</a>“‘If a man sells a dwelling house in a walled city, then he may redeem it within a whole year after it
has been sold. For a full year he shall have the right of redemption.
 <span class="verse"> 30</span><a name="C25V30">&nbsp;</a>If it isn’t redeemed within the space of a full year, then the house that is in the walled city shall
be made sure in perpetuity to him who bought it, throughout his generations. It shall not be released
in the Jubilee.
 <span class="verse"> 31</span><a name="C25V31">&nbsp;</a>But the houses of the villages which have no wall around them shall be accounted for with the fields
of the country: they may be redeemed, and they shall be released in the Jubilee.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 32</span><a name="C25V32">&nbsp;</a>“‘Nevertheless the cities of the Levites, the houses in the cities of their possession, the Levites may
redeem at any time.
 <span class="verse"> 33</span><a name="C25V33">&nbsp;</a>The Levites may redeem the house that was sold, and the city of his possession, and it shall be released
in the Jubilee; for the houses of the cities of the Levites are their possession among the children of
Israel.
 <span class="verse"> 34</span><a name="C25V34">&nbsp;</a>But the field of the suburbs of their cities may not be sold; for it is their perpetual possession.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 35</span><a name="C25V35">&nbsp;</a>“‘If your brother has become poor, and his hand can’t support himself among you; then you shall uphold
him. He shall live with you like an alien and a temporary resident.

 <span class="verse"> 37</span><a name="C25V37">&nbsp;</a>You shall not lend him your money at interest, nor give him your food for profit.
 <span class="verse"> 38</span><a name="C25V38">&nbsp;</a>I am Yahweh your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, to give you the land of Canaan, and to
be your God.

as a slave.
 <span class="verse"> 40</span><a name="C25V40">&nbsp;</a>As a hired servant, and as a temporary resident, he shall be with you; he shall serve with you until
the Year of Jubilee:
 <span class="verse"> 41</span><a name="C25V41">&nbsp;</a>then he shall go out from you, he and his children with him, and shall return to his own family, and
to the possession of his fathers.
 <span class="verse"> 42</span><a name="C25V42">&nbsp;</a>For they are my servants, whom I brought out of the land of Egypt. They shall not be sold as slaves.

<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 44</span><a name="C25V44">&nbsp;</a>“‘As for your male and your female slaves, whom you may have; of the nations that are around you, from
them you may buy male and female slaves.
 <span class="verse"> 45</span><a name="C25V45">&nbsp;</a>Moreover of the children of the aliens who live among you, of them you may buy, and of their families
who are with you, which they have conceived in your land; and they will be your property.
 <span class="verse"> 46</span><a name="C25V46">&nbsp;</a>You may make them an inheritance for your children after you, to hold for a possession; of them may you
take your slaves forever; but over your brothers the children of Israel you shall not rule, one over
another, with harshness.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 47</span><a name="C25V47">&nbsp;</a>“‘If an alien or temporary resident with you becomes rich, and your brother beside him has grown poor,
and sells himself to the stranger or foreigner living among you, or to a member of the stranger’s family;
 <span class="verse"> 48</span><a name="C25V48">&nbsp;</a>after he is sold he may be redeemed. One of his brothers may redeem him;
 <span class="verse"> 49</span><a name="C25V49">&nbsp;</a>or his uncle, or his uncle’s son, may redeem him, or any who is a close relative to him of his family
may redeem him; or if he has grown rich, he may redeem himself.
 <span class="verse"> 50</span><a name="C25V50">&nbsp;</a>He shall reckon with him who bought him from the year that he sold himself to him to the Year of Jubilee.
The price of his sale shall be according to the number of years; he shall be with him according to the
time of a hired servant.
 <span class="verse"> 51</span><a name="C25V51">&nbsp;</a>If there are yet many years, according to them he shall give back the price of his redemption out of
the money that he was bought for.
 <span class="verse"> 52</span><a name="C25V52">&nbsp;</a>If there remain but a few years to the year of jubilee, then he shall reckon with him; according to his
years of service he shall give back the price of his redemption.
 <span class="verse"> 53</span><a name="C25V53">&nbsp;</a>As a servant hired year by year shall he be with him. He shall not rule with harshness over him in your
sight.
 <span class="verse"> 54</span><a name="C25V54">&nbsp;</a>If he isn’t redeemed by these means, then he shall be released in the Year of Jubilee, he, and his children
with him.
 <span class="verse"> 55</span><a name="C25V55">&nbsp;</a>For to me the children of Israel are servants; they are my servants whom I brought out of the land of
Egypt. I am Yahweh your God.
