 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C4V1">&nbsp;</a>After these things I looked and saw a door opened in heaven, and the first voice that I heard, like a
trumpet speaking with me, was one saying, “Come up here, and I will show you the things which must happen
after this.”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C4V2">&nbsp;</a>Immediately I was in the Spirit. Behold, there was a throne set in heaven, and one sitting on the throne
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C4V3">&nbsp;</a>that looked like a jasper stone and a sardius. There was a rainbow around the throne, like an emerald
to look at.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C4V4">&nbsp;</a>Around the throne were twenty-four thrones. On the thrones were twenty-four elders sitting, dressed in
white garments, with crowns of gold on their heads.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C4V5">&nbsp;</a>Out of the throne proceed lightnings, sounds, and thunders. There were seven lamps of fire burning before
his throne, which are the seven Spirits of God.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C4V6">&nbsp;</a>Before the throne was something like a sea of glass, similar to crystal. In the middle of the throne,
and around the throne were four living creatures full of eyes before and behind.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C4V7">&nbsp;</a>The first creature was like a lion, and the second creature like a calf, and the third creature had a
face like a man, and the fourth was like a flying eagle.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C4V8">&nbsp;</a>The four living creatures, each one of them having six wings, are full of eyes around and within. They
have no rest day and night, saying, “Holy, holy, holy<a href="#FN1"><span class="notemark">*</span><span class="popup">Hodges/Farstad MT reads “holy” 9 times instead of 3.</span></a>
 is the Lord God, the Almighty, who was and who is and who is to come!”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C4V9">&nbsp;</a>When the living creatures give glory, honor, and thanks to him who sits on the throne, to him who lives
forever and ever,
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C4V10">&nbsp;</a>the twenty-four elders fall down before him who sits on the throne, and worship him who lives forever
and ever, and throw their crowns before the throne, saying,
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C4V11">&nbsp;</a>“Worthy are you, our Lord and God, the Holy One,<a href="#FN2"><span class="notemark">†</span><span class="popup">TR omits “and God, the Holy One,”</span></a>
 to receive the glory, the honor, and the power, for you created all things, and because of your desire
they existed, and were created!”
