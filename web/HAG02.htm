 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C2V1">&nbsp;</a>In the seventh month, in the twenty-first day of the month, Yahweh’s word came by Haggai the prophet,
saying,
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C2V2">&nbsp;</a>“Speak now to Zerubbabel, the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and to Joshua, the son of Jehozadak,
the high priest, and to the remnant of the people, saying,
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C2V3">&nbsp;</a>‘Who is left among you who saw this house in its former glory? How do you see it now? Isn’t it in your
eyes as nothing?
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C2V4">&nbsp;</a>Yet now be strong, Zerubbabel,’ says Yahweh. ‘Be strong, Joshua, son of Jehozadak, the high priest. Be
strong, all you people of the land,’ says Yahweh, ‘and work, for I am with you,’ says Yahweh of Armies.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C2V5">&nbsp;</a>This is the word that I covenanted with you when you came out of Egypt, and my Spirit lived among you.
‘Don’t be afraid.’
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C2V6">&nbsp;</a>For this is what Yahweh of Armies says: ‘Yet once, it is a little while, and I will shake the heavens,
the earth, the sea, and the dry land;
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C2V7">&nbsp;</a>and I will shake all nations. The precious things of all nations will come, and I will fill this house
with glory, says Yahweh of Armies.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C2V8">&nbsp;</a>The silver is mine, and the gold is mine,’ says Yahweh of Armies.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C2V9">&nbsp;</a>‘The latter glory of this house will be greater than the former,’ says Yahweh of Armies; ‘and in this
place will I give peace,’ says Yahweh of Armies.”

<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C2V10">&nbsp;</a>In the twenty-fourth day of the ninth month, in the second year of Darius, Yahweh’s word came by Haggai
the prophet, saying,
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C2V11">&nbsp;</a>“Yahweh of Armies says: Ask now the priests concerning the law, saying,
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C2V12">&nbsp;</a>‘If someone carries holy meat in the fold of his garment, and with his fold touches bread, stew, wine,
oil, or any food, will it become holy?’”
</div>
<div class="p">The priests answered, “No.”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C2V13">&nbsp;</a>Then Haggai said, “If one who is unclean by reason of a dead body touch any of these, will it be unclean?”
</div>
<div class="p">The priests answered, “It will be unclean.”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C2V14">&nbsp;</a>Then Haggai answered, “‘So is this people, and so is this nation before me,’ says Yahweh; ‘and so is
every work of their hands. That which they offer there is unclean.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C2V15">&nbsp;</a>Now, please consider from this day and backward, before a stone was laid on a stone in Yahweh’s temple.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C2V16">&nbsp;</a>Through all that time, when one came to a heap of twenty measures, there were only ten. When one came
to the wine vat to draw out fifty, there were only twenty.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C2V17">&nbsp;</a>I struck you with blight, mildew, and hail in all the work of your hands; yet you didn’t turn to me,’
says Yahweh.
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C2V18">&nbsp;</a>‘Consider, please, from this day and backward, from the twenty-fourth day of the ninth month, since the
day that the foundation of Yahweh’s temple was laid, consider it.
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C2V19">&nbsp;</a>Is the seed yet in the barn? Yes, the vine, the fig tree, the pomegranate, and the olive tree haven’t
produced. From today I will bless you.’”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C2V20">&nbsp;</a>Yahweh’s word came the second time to Haggai in the twenty-fourth day of the month, saying,
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C2V21">&nbsp;</a>“Speak to Zerubbabel, governor of Judah, saying, ‘I will shake the heavens and the earth.
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C2V22">&nbsp;</a>I will overthrow the throne of kingdoms. I will destroy the strength of the kingdoms of the nations.
I will overthrow the chariots, and those who ride in them. The horses and their riders will come down,
everyone by the sword of his brother.
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C2V23">&nbsp;</a>In that day, says Yahweh of Armies, will I take you, Zerubbabel, my servant, the son of Shealtiel,’ says
Yahweh, ‘and will make you as a signet, for I have chosen you,’ says Yahweh of Armies.”
