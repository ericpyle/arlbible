 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C10V1">&nbsp;</a>And Tobit his father made his count every day: and when the days of the journey were expired, and they
came not,
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C10V2">&nbsp;</a>he said,
<a href="#FN1"><span class="notemark">*</span><span class="popup">Many ancient authorities read
Are they perchance put to shame?
</span></a>
 Is he perchance detained? or is Gabael perchance dead, and there is no man to give him the money?
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C10V3">&nbsp;</a>And he was sorely grieved.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C10V4">&nbsp;</a>But his wife said to him, The child has perished, seeing he waits long; and she began to bewail him,
and said,
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C10V5">&nbsp;</a><a href="#FN2"><span class="notemark">†</span><span class="popup">Some authorities read
Woe is me.
</span></a>
 I care for nothing, my child, since I have let you go, the light of mine eyes.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C10V6">&nbsp;</a>And Tobit says to her, Hold your peace, take no care; he is in good health.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C10V7">&nbsp;</a>And she said to him, Hold your peace, deceive me not; my child has perished. And she went out every day
into the way by which they went, and did eat no bread in the day-time, and ceased not whole nights to
bewail her son Tobias, until the fourteen days of the wedding feast were expired, which Raguel had sworn
that he should spend there.

<div class="p">But Tobias said to Raguel, Send me away, for my father and my mother look no more to see me.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C10V8">&nbsp;</a>But his father in law said to him, Abide with me, and I will send to your father, and they shall declare
to him how things go with you.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C10V9">&nbsp;</a>And Tobias says, No; but send me away to my father.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C10V10">&nbsp;</a>But Raguel arose, and gave him Sarah his wife, and half his goods, servants and cattle and money;
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C10V11">&nbsp;</a>and he blessed them, and sent them away, saying, The God of heaven shall prosper you, my children, before
I die.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C10V12">&nbsp;</a>And he said to his daughter, Honor your father and your mother in law; they are now your parents; let
me hear a good report of you. And he kissed her. And Edna said to Tobias, The Lord of heaven restore
you, dear brother, and grant to me that I may see your children of my daughter Sarah, that I may rejoice
before the Lord: and, behold, I commit my daughter to you in special trust: vex her not.
