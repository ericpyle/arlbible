 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C12V1">&nbsp;</a>At that time, Jesus went on the Sabbath day through the grain fields. His disciples were hungry and began
to pluck heads of grain and to eat.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C12V2">&nbsp;</a>But the Pharisees, when they saw it, said to him, “Behold, your disciples do what is not lawful to do
on the Sabbath.”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C12V3">&nbsp;</a>But he said to them,
<span class="wj">“Haven’t you read what David did, when he was hungry, and those who were with him;
</span> <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C12V4">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">how he entered into God’s house, and ate the show bread, which was not lawful for him to eat, neither
for those who were with him, but only for the priests?</span><a href="#FN1"><span class="notemark"></span><span class="popup">+ 1 Samuel 21:3-6</span></a>
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C12V5">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Or have you not read in the law, that on the Sabbath day, the priests in the temple profane the Sabbath,
and are guiltless?
</span> <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C12V6">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">But I tell you that one greater than the temple is here.
</span> <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C12V7">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">But if you had known what this means, ‘I desire mercy, and not sacrifice,’</span><a href="#FN2"><span class="notemark"></span><span class="popup">+ Hosea 6:6</span></a>
<span class="wj">you would not have condemned the guiltless.
</span> <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C12V8">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">For the Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath.”</span></div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C12V9">&nbsp;</a>He departed there, and went into their synagogue.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C12V10">&nbsp;</a>And behold there was a man with a withered hand. They asked him, “Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath
day?” that they might accuse him.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C12V11">&nbsp;</a>He said to them,
<span class="wj">“What man is there among you, who has one sheep, and if this one falls into a pit on the Sabbath day,
won’t he grab on to it, and lift it out?
</span> <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C12V12">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Of how much more value then is a man than a sheep! Therefore it is lawful to do good on the Sabbath day.”</span> <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C12V13">&nbsp;</a>Then he told the man,
<span class="wj">“Stretch out your hand.”</span> He stretched it out; and it was restored whole, just like the other.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C12V14">&nbsp;</a>But the Pharisees went out, and conspired against him, how they might destroy him.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C12V15">&nbsp;</a>Jesus, perceiving that, withdrew from there. Great multitudes followed him; and he healed them all,
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C12V16">&nbsp;</a>and commanded them that they should not make him known:
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C12V17">&nbsp;</a>that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through Isaiah the prophet, saying,
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C12V18">&nbsp;</a>“Behold, my servant whom I have chosen;

<div class="q2">He will proclaim justice to the nations.

<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C12V19">&nbsp;</a>He will not strive, nor shout;
</div>
<div class="q2">neither will anyone hear his voice in the streets.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C12V20">&nbsp;</a>He won’t break a bruised reed.
</div>
<div class="q2">He won’t quench a smoking flax,
</div>
<div class="q1">until he leads justice to victory.
</div>
<div class="q2"> <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C12V21">&nbsp;</a>In his name, the nations will hope.”<a href="#FN3"><span class="notemark"></span><span class="popup">+ Isaiah 42:1-4</span></a>

<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C12V22">&nbsp;</a>Then one possessed by a demon, blind and mute, was brought to him and he healed him, so that the blind
and mute man both spoke and saw.
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C12V23">&nbsp;</a>All the multitudes were amazed, and said, “Can this be the son of David?”
 <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C12V24">&nbsp;</a>But when the Pharisees heard it, they said, “This man does not cast out demons, except by Beelzebul,
the prince of the demons.”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C12V25">&nbsp;</a>Knowing their thoughts, Jesus said to them,
<span class="wj">“Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation, and every city or house divided against
itself will not stand.
</span> <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C12V26">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">If Satan casts out Satan, he is divided against himself. How then will his kingdom stand?
</span> <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C12V27">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">If I by Beelzebul cast out demons, by whom do your children cast them out? Therefore they will be your
judges.
</span> <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C12V28">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">But if I by the Spirit of God cast out demons, then God’s Kingdom has come upon you.
</span> <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C12V29">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Or how can one enter into the house of the strong man, and plunder his goods, unless he first bind the
strong man? Then he will plunder his house.</span></div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 30</span><a name="C12V30">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">“He who is not with me is against me, and he who doesn’t gather with me, scatters.
</span> <span class="verse"> 31</span><a name="C12V31">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Therefore I tell you, every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven men, but the blasphemy against the Spirit
will not be forgiven men.

Holy Spirit, it will not be forgiven him, neither in this age, nor in that which is to come.</span></div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 33</span><a name="C12V33">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">“Either make the tree good, and its fruit good, or make the tree corrupt, and its fruit corrupt; for
the tree is known by its fruit.
</span> <span class="verse"> 34</span><a name="C12V34">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">You offspring of vipers, how can you, being evil, speak good things? For out of the abundance of the
heart, the mouth speaks.

<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 38</span><a name="C12V38">&nbsp;</a>Then certain of the scribes and Pharisees answered, “Teacher, we want to see a sign from you.”

Jonah the prophet.
</span> <span class="verse"> 40</span><a name="C12V40">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">For as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of the whale, so will the Son of Man be three
days and three nights in the heart of the earth.

repented at the preaching of Jonah; and behold, someone greater than Jonah is here.
</span> <span class="verse"> 42</span><a name="C12V42">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">The queen of the south will rise up in the judgment with this generation, and will condemn it, for she
came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and behold, someone greater than Solomon
is here.

<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 43</span><a name="C12V43">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">When an unclean spirit has gone out of a man, he passes through waterless places, seeking rest, and doesn’t
find it.
</span> <span class="verse"> 44</span><a name="C12V44">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Then he says, ‘I will return into my house from which I came out,’ and when he has come back, he finds
it empty, swept, and put in order.
</span> <span class="verse"> 45</span><a name="C12V45">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Then he goes, and takes with himself seven other spirits more evil than he is, and they enter in and
dwell there. The last state of that man becomes worse than the first. Even so will it be also to this
evil generation.”</span></div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 46</span><a name="C12V46">&nbsp;</a>While he was yet speaking to the multitudes, behold, his mother and his brothers stood outside, seeking
to speak to him.
