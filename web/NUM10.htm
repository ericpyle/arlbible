 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C10V1">&nbsp;</a>Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C10V2">&nbsp;</a>“Make two trumpets of silver. You shall make them of beaten work. You shall use them for the calling
of the congregation, and for the journeying of the camps.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C10V3">&nbsp;</a>When they blow them, all the congregation shall gather themselves to you at the door of the Tent of Meeting.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C10V4">&nbsp;</a>If they blow just one, then the princes, the heads of the thousands of Israel, shall gather themselves
to you.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C10V5">&nbsp;</a>When you blow an alarm, the camps that lie on the east side shall go forward.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C10V6">&nbsp;</a>When you blow an alarm the second time, the camps that lie on the south side shall go forward. They shall
blow an alarm for their journeys.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C10V7">&nbsp;</a>But when the assembly is to be gathered together, you shall blow, but you shall not sound an alarm.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C10V8">&nbsp;</a>“The sons of Aaron, the priests, shall blow the trumpets. This shall be to you for a statute forever
throughout your generations.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C10V9">&nbsp;</a>When you go to war in your land against the adversary who oppresses you, then you shall sound an alarm
with the trumpets. Then you will be remembered before Yahweh your God, and you will be saved from your
enemies.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C10V10">&nbsp;</a>“Also in the day of your gladness, and in your set feasts, and in the beginnings of your months, you
shall blow the trumpets over your burnt offerings, and over the sacrifices of your peace offerings; and
they shall be to you for a memorial before your God. I am Yahweh your God.”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C10V11">&nbsp;</a>In the second year, in the second month, on the twentieth day of the month, the cloud was taken up from
over the tabernacle of the testimony.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C10V12">&nbsp;</a>The children of Israel went forward according to their journeys out of the wilderness of Sinai; and the
cloud stayed in the wilderness of Paran.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C10V13">&nbsp;</a>They first went forward according to the commandment of Yahweh by Moses.

</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C10V29">&nbsp;</a>Moses said to Hobab, the son of Reuel the Midianite, Moses’ father-in-law, “We are journeying to the
place of which Yahweh said, ‘I will give it to you.’ Come with us, and we will treat you well; for Yahweh
has spoken good concerning Israel.”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 30</span><a name="C10V30">&nbsp;</a>He said to him, “I will not go; but I will depart to my own land, and to my relatives.”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 31</span><a name="C10V31">&nbsp;</a>He said, “Don’t leave us, please; because you know how we are to encamp in the wilderness, and you can
be our eyes.
 <span class="verse"> 32</span><a name="C10V32">&nbsp;</a>It shall be, if you go with us, yes, it shall be, that whatever good Yahweh does to us, we will do the
same to you.”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 33</span><a name="C10V33">&nbsp;</a>They set forward from the Mount of Yahweh three days’ journey. The ark of Yahweh’s covenant went before
them three days’ journey, to seek out a resting place for them.
 <span class="verse"> 34</span><a name="C10V34">&nbsp;</a>The cloud of Yahweh was over them by day, when they set forward from the camp.
 <span class="verse"> 35</span><a name="C10V35">&nbsp;</a>When the ark went forward, Moses said, “Rise up, Yahweh, and let your enemies be scattered! Let those
who hate you flee before you!”
 <span class="verse"> 36</span><a name="C10V36">&nbsp;</a>When it rested, he said, “Return, Yahweh, to the ten thousands of the thousands of Israel.”
