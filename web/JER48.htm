 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C48V1">&nbsp;</a>Of Moab. Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel, says:

<div class="q1">“Woe to Nebo!

<div class="q1">Misgab<a href="#FN1"><span class="notemark">*</span><span class="popup">or, The stronghold</span></a>

</div>
<div class="q2">and broken down.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C48V2">&nbsp;</a>The praise of Moab is no more;
</div>
<div class="q2">in Heshbon they have devised evil against her:
</div>
<div class="q2">‘Come, and let us cut her off from being a nation.’
</div>
<div class="q1">You also, Madmen, will be brought to silence.
</div>
<div class="q2">The sword will pursue you.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C48V3">&nbsp;</a>The sound of a cry from Horonaim,
</div>
<div class="q2">desolation and great destruction!
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C48V4">&nbsp;</a>Moab is destroyed.
</div>
<div class="q2">Her little ones have caused a cry to be heard.

<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C48V5">&nbsp;</a>For they will go up by the ascent of Luhith with continual weeping.
</div>
<div class="q2">For at the descent of Horonaim they have heard the distress of the cry of destruction.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C48V6">&nbsp;</a>Flee! Save your lives!
</div>
<div class="q2">Be like the juniper bush in the wilderness.

<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C48V7">&nbsp;</a>For, because you have trusted in your works and in your treasures,
</div>
<div class="q2">you also will be taken.
</div>
<div class="q1">Chemosh will go out into captivity,
</div>
<div class="q2">his priests and his princes together.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C48V8">&nbsp;</a>The destroyer will come on every city,

<div class="q2">and no city will escape;

<div class="q2">and the plain will be destroyed; as Yahweh has spoken.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C48V9">&nbsp;</a>Give wings to Moab,
</div>
<div class="q2">that she may fly and get herself away:
</div>
<div class="q1">and her cities will become a desolation,
</div>
<div class="q2">without anyone to dwell in them.
</div>
<div class="b"></div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C48V10">&nbsp;</a>“Cursed is he who does the work of Yahweh negligently;

<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C48V11">&nbsp;</a>“Moab has been at ease from his youth,

<div class="q2">and he has settled on his lees,
</div>
<div class="q1">and has not been emptied from vessel to vessel,
</div>
<div class="q2">neither has he gone into captivity:
</div>
<div class="q1">therefore his taste remains in him,
</div>
<div class="q2">and his scent is not changed.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C48V12">&nbsp;</a>Therefore behold, the days come,” says Yahweh,
</div>
<div class="q2">“that I will send to him those who pour off,
</div>
<div class="q1">and they will pour him off;
</div>
<div class="q2">and they will empty his vessels,
</div>
<div class="q2">and break their bottles in pieces.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C48V13">&nbsp;</a>Moab will be ashamed of Chemosh,

<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C48V16">&nbsp;</a>“The calamity of Moab is near to come,
</div>
<div class="q2">and his affliction hurries fast.

<div class="q2">and all you who know his name; say,

<div class="q2">and sit in thirst;
</div>
<div class="q1">for the destroyer of Moab has come up against you,

<div class="q2">he has destroyed your strongholds.

<div class="q2">say, ‘What has been done?’

<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C48V20">&nbsp;</a>Moab is disappointed;
</div>
<div class="q2">for it is broken down.
</div>
<div class="q1">Wail and cry!
</div>
<div class="q2">Tell it by the Arnon, that Moab is laid waste.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C48V21">&nbsp;</a>Judgment has come on the plain country,

<div class="q2">on Holon, and on Jahzah, and on Mephaath,

</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C48V25">&nbsp;</a>The horn of Moab is cut off,
</div>
<div class="q2">and his arm is broken,” says Yahweh.

<div class="b"></div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C48V26">&nbsp;</a>“Make him drunken;
</div>
<div class="q2">for he magnified himself against Yahweh:
</div>
<div class="q1">and Moab will wallow in his vomit,
</div>
<div class="q2">and he also will be in derision.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C48V27">&nbsp;</a>For wasn’t Israel a derision to you?
</div>
<div class="q2">was he found among thieves?
</div>
<div class="q1">for as often as you speak of him,
</div>
<div class="q2">you shake your head.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C48V28">&nbsp;</a>You inhabitants of Moab, leave the cities, and dwell in the rock;
</div>
<div class="q2">and be like the dove that makes her nest over the mouth of the abyss.

<div class="b"></div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C48V29">&nbsp;</a>“We have heard of the pride of Moab.
</div>
<div class="q2">He is very proud; his loftiness, and his pride,
</div>
<div class="q2">and his arrogance, and the haughtiness of his heart.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 30</span><a name="C48V30">&nbsp;</a>I know his wrath,” says Yahweh, “that it is nothing;
</div>
<div class="q2">his boastings have worked nothing.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 31</span><a name="C48V31">&nbsp;</a>Therefore I will wail for Moab.
</div>
<div class="q2">Yes, I will cry out for all Moab.
</div>
<div class="q2">They will mourn for the men of Kir Heres.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 32</span><a name="C48V32">&nbsp;</a>With more than the weeping of Jazer
</div>
<div class="q2">will I weep for you, vine of Sibmah.
</div>
<div class="q1">Your branches passed over the sea.
</div>
<div class="q2">They reached even to the sea of Jazer.
</div>
<div class="q1">The destroyer has fallen on your summer fruits
</div>
<div class="q2">and on your vintage.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 33</span><a name="C48V33">&nbsp;</a>Gladness and joy is taken away from the fruitful field
</div>
<div class="q2">and from the land of Moab.
</div>
<div class="q1">I have caused wine to cease from the wine presses.
</div>
<div class="q2">No one will tread with shouting.
</div>
<div class="q2">The shouting will be no shouting.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 34</span><a name="C48V34">&nbsp;</a>From the cry of Heshbon even to Elealeh,
</div>
<div class="q2">even to Jahaz have they uttered their voice,
</div>
<div class="q2">from Zoar even to Horonaim, to Eglath Shelishiyah:
</div>
<div class="q2">for the waters of Nimrim also will become desolate.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 35</span><a name="C48V35">&nbsp;</a>Moreover I will cause to cease in Moab,” says Yahweh,
</div>
<div class="q2">“him who offers in the high place,
</div>
<div class="q2">and him who burns incense to his gods.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 36</span><a name="C48V36">&nbsp;</a>Therefore my heart sounds for Moab like pipes,
</div>
<div class="q2">and my heart sounds like pipes for the men of Kir Heres.
</div>
<div class="q2">Therefore the abundance that he has gotten has perished.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 37</span><a name="C48V37">&nbsp;</a>For every head is bald,
</div>
<div class="q2">and every beard clipped.
</div>
<div class="q1">There are cuttings on all the hands,
</div>
<div class="q2">and sackcloth on the waist.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 38</span><a name="C48V38">&nbsp;</a>On all the housetops of Moab,
</div>
<div class="q2">and in its streets, there is lamentation everywhere;
</div>
<div class="q2">for I have broken Moab like a vessel in which no one delights,” says Yahweh.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 39</span><a name="C48V39">&nbsp;</a>“How it is broken down!
</div>
<div class="q2">How they wail!
</div>
<div class="q1">How Moab has turned the back with shame!
</div>
<div class="q2">So will Moab become a derision
</div>
<div class="q2">and a terror to all who are around him.”
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 40</span><a name="C48V40">&nbsp;</a>For Yahweh says: “Behold, he will fly as an eagle,
</div>
<div class="q2">and will spread out his wings against Moab.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 41</span><a name="C48V41">&nbsp;</a>Kerioth is taken,
</div>
<div class="q2">and the strongholds are seized.
</div>
<div class="q1">The heart of the mighty men of Moab at that day
</div>
<div class="q2">will be as the heart of a woman in her pangs.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 42</span><a name="C48V42">&nbsp;</a>Moab will be destroyed from being a people,
</div>
<div class="q2">because he has magnified himself against Yahweh.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 43</span><a name="C48V43">&nbsp;</a>Terror, the pit, and the snare are on you,
</div>
<div class="q2">inhabitant of Moab,” says Yahweh.

<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 44</span><a name="C48V44">&nbsp;</a>“He who flees from the terror will fall into the pit;
</div>
<div class="q2">and he who gets up out of the pit will be taken in the snare:
</div>
<div class="q1">for I will bring on him, even on Moab,
</div>
<div class="q2">the year of their visitation,” says Yahweh.
</div>
<div class="b"></div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 45</span><a name="C48V45">&nbsp;</a>“Those who fled stand without strength under the shadow of Heshbon;
</div>
<div class="q2">for a fire has gone out of Heshbon,
</div>
<div class="q2">and a flame from the middle of Sihon,
</div>
<div class="q1">and has devoured the corner of Moab,
</div>
<div class="q2">and the crown of the head of the tumultuous ones.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 46</span><a name="C48V46">&nbsp;</a>Woe to you, O Moab!
</div>
<div class="q2">The people of Chemosh are undone;

<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 47</span><a name="C48V47">&nbsp;</a>“Yet I will bring back the captivity of Moab in the latter days,”
