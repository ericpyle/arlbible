<span class="add">already

time that Jason and his company revolted from the holy land and the kingdom,

 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C1V13">&nbsp;</a>For when the prince was come

treachery of Nanaea’s priests.

 the treasures forth, and he was come there with a small company within the wall of the precincts, they
shut to the temple when Antiochus was come in:

<a href="#FN6"><span class="notemark">††</span><span class="popup">Gr.

 struck down the prince, and they hewed

<a href="#FN8"><span class="notemark">§§</span><span class="popup">The Greek text here is corrupt.
</span></a>
 you⌃ also may keep a feast of tabernacles, and
<span class="add">a memorial
</span> of the fire
<span class="add">which was given
</span> when Nehemiah offered sacrifices, after that he had builded both the temple and the altar.
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C1V19">&nbsp;</a>For indeed when our fathers were about to be led into the land of Persia, the godly priests of that time
took of the fire of the altar, and hid it privily in the hollow of a well that was without water, wherein
they made
<span class="add">it
</span> sure, so that the place was unknown to all men.
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C1V20">&nbsp;</a>Now after many years, when it pleased God, Nehemiah, having received a charge from the king of Persia,
sent in quest of the fire the descendants of the priests that hid it. When they declared to us that they
had found no fire, but thick water,
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C1V21">&nbsp;</a>he commanded them to draw out thereof and bring
<span class="add">to him:
</span> and when
<a href="#FN9"><span class="notemark">***</span><span class="popup">Gr.
the things of the sacrifices.
Similarily in verses 31, 33, and 2 Maccabees 2:10.
</span></a>
 the sacrifices had been offered
<span class="add">on the altar,
</span> Nehemiah commanded the priests to sprinkle with the water both the wood and the things laid thereupon.
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C1V22">&nbsp;</a>And when it was done, and some time had passed, and the sun shone out, which before was hid with clouds,
there was kindled a great blaze, so that all men marveled.
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C1V23">&nbsp;</a>And the priests made a prayer while the sacrifice was consuming, both the priests and all
<span class="add">others,
</span> Jonathan leading and the rest answering, as Nehemiah did.
 <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C1V24">&nbsp;</a>And the prayer was after this manner:
</div>
<div class="p">O Lord, Lord God, the Creator of all things, who are terrible and strong and righteous and merciful,
who alone are King and gracious,
 <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C1V25">&nbsp;</a>who alone suppliest
<span class="add">every need,
</span> who alone are righteous and almighty and eternal, you that save Israel out of all evil, who made the
fathers
<span class="add">your
</span> chosen, and did sanctify them:
 <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C1V26">&nbsp;</a>accept the sacrifice for all your people Israel, and guard your own portion, and consecrate it.
 <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C1V27">&nbsp;</a>Gather together our Dispersion, set at liberty them that are in bondage among the heathen, look upon
them that are despised and abhorred, and let the heathen know that you are our God.
 <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C1V28">&nbsp;</a>Torment them that oppress us and in arrogancy shamefully entreat us.
 <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C1V29">&nbsp;</a>Plant your people in your holy place, even as Moses said.

<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 30</span><a name="C1V30">&nbsp;</a>And thereupon the priests sang the hymns.
 <span class="verse"> 31</span><a name="C1V31">&nbsp;</a>And as soon as the sacrifice was consumed, then Nehemiah commanded

that great stones should inclose the water that was left.

 to pour
<span class="add">on
</span> great stones the water that was left.
 <span class="verse"> 32</span><a name="C1V32">&nbsp;</a>And when this was done, a flame was kindled;
<a href="#FN11"><span class="notemark">‡‡‡</span><span class="popup">Or,

 but when the light from the altar
<a href="#FN12"><span class="notemark">§§§</span><span class="popup">Or,
shone back
</span></a>
 shone over against it,
<span class="add">all
</span> was consumed.
 <span class="verse"> 33</span><a name="C1V33">&nbsp;</a>And when the matter became known, and it was told the king of the Persians, that, in the place where
the priests that were led away had hid the fire, there appeared the water, wherewith also Nehemiah and
they that were with him purified the sacrifice,
 <span class="verse"> 34</span><a name="C1V34">&nbsp;</a>then the king, inclosing
<span class="add">the place,
</span> made it sacred, after he had proved the matter.
 <span class="verse"> 35</span><a name="C1V35">&nbsp;</a>And when the king would show favor to any, he would take
<span class="add">from them
</span> many presents and give them some of
<span class="add">this water.
</span> <span class="verse"> 36</span><a name="C1V36">&nbsp;</a>And Nehemiah and they that were with him called this thing Nephthar, which is by interpretation, Cleansing;
but most men call it Nephthai.
