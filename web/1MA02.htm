 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C2V1">&nbsp;</a>In those days rose up Mattathias the son of John, the son of Simeon, a priest of the sons of Joarib,
from Jerusalem; and he lived at Modin.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C2V2">&nbsp;</a>And he had five sons,

 John, who was surnamed Gaddis;
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C2V3">&nbsp;</a>Simon, who was called Thassi;
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C2V4">&nbsp;</a>Judas, who was called Maccabaeus;
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C2V5">&nbsp;</a>Eleazar, who was called Avaran; Jonathan, who was called Apphus.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C2V6">&nbsp;</a>And he saw the blasphemies that were committed in Judah and in Jerusalem,
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C2V7">&nbsp;</a>and he said,
</div>
<div class="p">Woe is me! wherefore was I born to see the destruction of my people, and the destruction of the holy
city, and to dwell there, when it was given into the hand of the enemy, the sanctuary into the hand of
aliens?

 that was glorious:
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C2V9">&nbsp;</a>her vessels of glory are carried away into captivity, her infants are slain in her streets, her young
men with the sword of the enemy.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C2V10">&nbsp;</a>What nation has not inherited her palaces, and gotten possession of her spoils?
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C2V11">&nbsp;</a>her adorning is all taken away; instead of a free woman she is become a bond woman:
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C2V12">&nbsp;</a>and, behold, our holy things and our beauty and our glory are laid waste, and the Gentiles have profaned
them.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C2V13">&nbsp;</a>Wherefore should we live any longer?
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C2V14">&nbsp;</a>And Mattathias and his sons tore their clothes, and put on sackcloth, and mourned exceedingly.

<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C2V15">&nbsp;</a>And the king’s officers, that were enforcing the apostasy, came into the city Modin to sacrifice.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C2V16">&nbsp;</a>And many of Israel came to them, and Mattathias and his sons were gathered together.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C2V17">&nbsp;</a>And the king’s officers answered and spoke to Mattathias, saying, You are a ruler and an honorable and
great man in this city, and strengthened with sons and brethren:
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C2V18">&nbsp;</a>now therefore come you first and do the commandment of the king, as all the nations have done, and the
men of Judah, and they that remain in Jerusalem: and you and your house shall be in the number of the
king’s

 Friends, and you and your sons shall be honored with silver and gold and many gifts.
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C2V19">&nbsp;</a>And Mattathias answered and said with a loud voice, If all the nations that are in the house of the king’s
dominion hearken to him, to fall away each one from the worship of his fathers, and have made choice
to follow his commandments,
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C2V20">&nbsp;</a>yet will I and my sons and my brethren walk in the covenant of our fathers.

May he be propitious.
Compare 2 Samuel 23:17 (Septuagint).
</span></a>
 Heaven forbid that we should forsake the law and the ordinances.
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C2V22">&nbsp;</a>We will not hearken to the king’s words, to go aside from our worship, on the right hand, or on the left.
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C2V23">&nbsp;</a>And when he had left speaking these words, there came a Jew in the sight of all to sacrifice on the altar
which was at Modin, according to the king’s commandment.
 <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C2V24">&nbsp;</a>And Mattathias saw it, and his zeal was kindled, and his reins trembled, and he showed forth his wrath
according to judgement, and ran, and killed him upon the altar.
 <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C2V25">&nbsp;</a>And the king’s officer, who compelled men to sacrifice, he killed at that time, and pulled down the altar.
 <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C2V26">&nbsp;</a>And he was zealous for the law, even as Phinehas did to Zimri the son of Salu.
 <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C2V27">&nbsp;</a>And Mattathias cried out in the city with a loud voice, saying, Whosoever is zealous for the law, and
maintains the covenant, let him come forth after me.
 <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C2V28">&nbsp;</a>And he and his sons fled into the mountains, and forsook all that they had in the city.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C2V29">&nbsp;</a>Then many that sought after justice and judgement went down into the wilderness, to dwell there,
 <span class="verse"> 30</span><a name="C2V30">&nbsp;</a>they, and their sons, and their wives, and their cattle; because evils were multiplied upon them.
 <span class="verse"> 31</span><a name="C2V31">&nbsp;</a>And it was told the king’s officers, and the forces that were in Jerusalem, the city of David, that certain
men, who had broken the king’s commandment, were gone down into the secret places in the wilderness;
 <span class="verse"> 32</span><a name="C2V32">&nbsp;</a>and many pursued after them, and having overtaken them, they encamped against them, and set the battle
in array against them on the Sabbath day.
 <span class="verse"> 33</span><a name="C2V33">&nbsp;</a>And they said to them, Thus far. Come forth, and do according to the word of the king, and you⌃ shall
live.
 <span class="verse"> 34</span><a name="C2V34">&nbsp;</a>And they said, We will not come forth, neither will we do the word of the king, to profane the Sabbath
day.
 <span class="verse"> 35</span><a name="C2V35">&nbsp;</a>And they hasted to give them battle.
 <span class="verse"> 36</span><a name="C2V36">&nbsp;</a>And they answered them not, neither cast they a stone at them, nor stopped up the secret places,
 <span class="verse"> 37</span><a name="C2V37">&nbsp;</a>saying, Let us die all in our innocency: heaven and earth witness over us, that you⌃ put us to death
without trial.
 <span class="verse"> 38</span><a name="C2V38">&nbsp;</a>And they rose up against them in battle on the Sabbath, and they died, they and their wives and their
children, and their cattle, to the number of a thousand

 souls.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 39</span><a name="C2V39">&nbsp;</a>And Mattathias and his friends knew it, and they mourned over them exceedingly.
 <span class="verse"> 40</span><a name="C2V40">&nbsp;</a>And one said to another, If we all do as our brethren have done, and fight not against the Gentiles for
our lives and our ordinances, they will now quickly destroy us from off the earth.
 <span class="verse"> 41</span><a name="C2V41">&nbsp;</a>And they took counsel on that day, saying, whoever shall come against us to battle on the Sabbath day,
let us fight against him, and we shall in no wise all die, as our brethren died in the secret places.
 <span class="verse"> 42</span><a name="C2V42">&nbsp;</a>Then were gathered together to them a company of
<a href="#FN6"><span class="notemark">**</span><span class="popup">That is,
Chasidim.
</span></a>
 Hasidaeans, mighty men of Israel, every one that offered himself willingly for the law.
 <span class="verse"> 43</span><a name="C2V43">&nbsp;</a>And all they that fled from the evils were added to them, and became a stay to them.
 <span class="verse"> 44</span><a name="C2V44">&nbsp;</a>And they mustered a host, and struck sinners in their anger, and lawless men in their wrath: and the
rest fled to the Gentiles for safety.
 <span class="verse"> 45</span><a name="C2V45">&nbsp;</a>And Mattathias and his friends went round about, and pulled down the altars;
 <span class="verse"> 46</span><a name="C2V46">&nbsp;</a>and they circumcised by force the children that were uncircumcised, as many as they found in the coasts
of Israel.
 <span class="verse"> 47</span><a name="C2V47">&nbsp;</a>And they pursued after the sons of pride, and the work prospered in their hand.
 <span class="verse"> 48</span><a name="C2V48">&nbsp;</a>And they rescued the law out of the hand of the Gentiles, and out of the hand of the kings, neither

 suffered they the sinner to triumph.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 49</span><a name="C2V49">&nbsp;</a>And the days of Mattathias drew near that he should die, and he said to his sons,
</div>
<div class="p">Now have pride and rebuke gotten strength, and a season of overthrow, and wrath of indignation.
 <span class="verse"> 50</span><a name="C2V50">&nbsp;</a>And now, my children, be you⌃ zealous for the law, and give your lives for the covenant of your fathers.
 <span class="verse"> 51</span><a name="C2V51">&nbsp;</a>And call to remembrance the deeds of our fathers which they did in their generations; and receive great
glory and an everlasting name.
 <span class="verse"> 52</span><a name="C2V52">&nbsp;</a>Was not Abraham found faithful in temptation, and it was reckoned to him for righteousness?

 <span class="verse"> 63</span><a name="C2V63">&nbsp;</a>To-day he shall be lifted up, and to-morrow he shall in no wise be found, because he is returned to his
