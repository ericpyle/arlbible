<div class="chapterlabel"> 40</div><div class="p">
 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C40V1">&nbsp;</a>The word which came to Jeremiah from Yahweh, after Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had let him go
from Ramah, when he had taken him being bound in chains among all the captives of Jerusalem and Judah,
who were carried away captive to Babylon.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C40V2">&nbsp;</a>The captain of the guard took Jeremiah, and said to him, “Yahweh your God pronounced this evil on this
place;
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C40V3">&nbsp;</a>and Yahweh has brought it, and done according as he spoke: because you have sinned against Yahweh, and
have not obeyed his voice, therefore this thing has come on you.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C40V4">&nbsp;</a>Now, behold, I release you today from the chains which are on your hand. If it seems good to you to come
with me into Babylon, come, and I will take care of you; but if it seems bad to you to come with me into
Babylon, don’t. Behold, all the land is before you. Where it seems good and right to you to go, there
go.”
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C40V5">&nbsp;</a>Now while he had not yet gone back, “Go back then,” he said, “to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son
of Shaphan, whom the king of Babylon has made governor over the cities of Judah, and dwell with him among
the people; or go wherever it seems right to you to go.”
</div>
<div class="p">So the captain of the guard gave him food and a present, and let him go.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C40V6">&nbsp;</a>Then Jeremiah went to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam to Mizpah, and lived with him among the people who were
left in the land.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C40V7">&nbsp;</a>Now when all the captains of the forces who were in the fields, even they and their men, heard that the
king of Babylon had made Gedaliah the son of Ahikam governor in the land, and had committed to him men,
women, children, and of the poorest of the land, of those who were not carried away captive to Babylon;
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C40V8">&nbsp;</a>then they came to Gedaliah to Mizpah, Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and Johanan and Jonathan the sons
of Kareah, and Seraiah the son of Tanhumeth, and the sons of Ephai the Netophathite, and Jezaniah the
son of the Maacathite, they and their men.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C40V9">&nbsp;</a>Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan swore to them and to their men, saying, “Don’t be afraid
to serve the Chaldeans. Dwell in the land, and serve the king of Babylon, and it will be well with you.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C40V10">&nbsp;</a>As for me, behold, I will dwell at Mizpah, to stand before the Chaldeans who will come to us; but you,
gather wine and summer fruits and oil, and put them in your vessels, and dwell in your cities that you
have taken.”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C40V11">&nbsp;</a>Likewise when all the Jews who were in Moab, and among the children of Ammon, and in Edom, and who were
in all the countries, heard that the king of Babylon had left a remnant of Judah, and that he had set
over them Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan;
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C40V12">&nbsp;</a>then all the Jews returned out of all places where they were driven, and came to the land of Judah, to
Gedaliah, to Mizpah, and gathered wine and summer fruits very much.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C40V13">&nbsp;</a>Moreover Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces who were in the fields, came to
Gedaliah to Mizpah,
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C40V14">&nbsp;</a>and said to him, “Do you know that Baalis the king of the children of Ammon has sent Ishmael the son
of Nethaniah to take your life?”
</div>
<div class="p">But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam didn’t believe them.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C40V15">&nbsp;</a>Then Johanan the son of Kareah spoke to Gedaliah in Mizpah secretly, saying, “Please let me go, and I
will kill Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and no man will know it. Why should he take your life, that all
the Jews who are gathered to you should be scattered, and the remnant of Judah perish?”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C40V16">&nbsp;</a>But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam said to Johanan the son of Kareah, “You shall not do this thing; for you
speak falsely of Ishmael.”
