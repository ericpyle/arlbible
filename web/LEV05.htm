flock, a lamb or a goat, for a sin offering; and the priest shall make atonement for him concerning his
sin.

his trespass offering to Yahweh, a ram without defect from the flock, according to your estimation in
silver by shekels, after the shekel<a href="#FN2"><span class="notemark">†</span><span class="popup">A shekel is about 10 grams or about 0.35 ounces.</span></a>
