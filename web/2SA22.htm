 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C22V1">&nbsp;</a>David spoke to Yahweh the words of this song in the day that Yahweh delivered him out of the hand of
all his enemies, and out of the hand of Saul,
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C22V2">&nbsp;</a>and he said:
</div>
<div class="q1">“Yahweh is my rock,
</div>
<div class="q2">my fortress,
</div>
<div class="q2">and my deliverer, even mine;
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C22V3">&nbsp;</a>God is my rock in whom I take refuge;
</div>
<div class="q2">my shield, and the horn of my salvation,
</div>
<div class="q2">my high tower, and my refuge.
</div>
<div class="q2">My savior, you save me from violence.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C22V4">&nbsp;</a>I call on Yahweh, who is worthy to be praised;
</div>
<div class="q2">So shall I be saved from my enemies.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C22V5">&nbsp;</a>For the waves of death surrounded me.
</div>
<div class="q2">The floods of ungodliness made me afraid.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C22V6">&nbsp;</a>The cords of Sheol<a href="#FN1"><span class="notemark">*</span><span class="popup">Sheol is the place of the dead.</span></a>
 were around me.
</div>
<div class="q2">The snares of death caught me.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C22V7">&nbsp;</a>In my distress, I called on Yahweh.
</div>
<div class="q2">Yes, I called to my God.
</div>
<div class="q1">He heard my voice out of his temple.
</div>
<div class="q2">My cry came into his ears.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C22V8">&nbsp;</a>Then the earth shook and trembled.
</div>
<div class="q2">The foundations of heaven quaked and were shaken,
</div>
<div class="q2">because he was angry.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C22V9">&nbsp;</a>Smoke went up out of his nostrils.
</div>
<div class="q2">Consuming fire came out of his mouth.
</div>
<div class="q2">Coals were kindled by it.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C22V10">&nbsp;</a>He bowed the heavens also, and came down.
</div>
<div class="q2">Thick darkness was under his feet.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C22V11">&nbsp;</a>He rode on a cherub, and flew.
</div>
<div class="q2">Yes, he was seen on the wings of the wind.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C22V12">&nbsp;</a>He made darkness a shelter around himself:
</div>
<div class="q2">gathering of waters, and thick clouds of the skies.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C22V13">&nbsp;</a>At the brightness before him,
</div>
<div class="q2">coals of fire were kindled.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C22V14">&nbsp;</a>Yahweh thundered from heaven.
</div>
<div class="q2">The Most High uttered his voice.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C22V15">&nbsp;</a>He sent out arrows, and scattered them;
</div>
<div class="q2">lightning, and confused them.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C22V16">&nbsp;</a>Then the channels of the sea appeared.
</div>
<div class="q2">The foundations of the world were laid bare by Yahweh’s rebuke,
</div>
<div class="q2">at the blast of the breath of his nostrils.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C22V17">&nbsp;</a>He sent from on high and he took me.
</div>
<div class="q2">He drew me out of many waters.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C22V18">&nbsp;</a>He delivered me from my strong enemy,
</div>
<div class="q2">from those who hated me, for they were too mighty for me.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C22V19">&nbsp;</a>They came on me in the day of my calamity,
</div>
<div class="q2">but Yahweh was my support.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C22V20">&nbsp;</a>He also brought me out into a large place.
</div>
<div class="q2">He delivered me, because he delighted in me.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C22V21">&nbsp;</a>Yahweh rewarded me according to my righteousness.
</div>
<div class="q2">He rewarded me according to the cleanness of my hands.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C22V22">&nbsp;</a>For I have kept Yahweh’s ways,
</div>
<div class="q2">and have not wickedly departed from my God.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C22V23">&nbsp;</a>For all his ordinances were before me.
</div>
<div class="q2">As for his statutes, I did not depart from them.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C22V24">&nbsp;</a>I was also perfect toward him.
</div>
<div class="q2">I kept myself from my iniquity.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C22V25">&nbsp;</a>Therefore Yahweh has rewarded me according to my righteousness,
</div>
<div class="q2">According to my cleanness in his eyesight.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C22V26">&nbsp;</a>With the merciful you will show yourself merciful.
</div>
<div class="q2">With the perfect man you will show yourself perfect.
</div>
<div class="q2"> <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C22V27">&nbsp;</a>With the pure you will show yourself pure.
</div>
<div class="q2">With the crooked you will show yourself shrewd.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C22V28">&nbsp;</a>You will save the afflicted people,
</div>
<div class="q2">But your eyes are on the haughty, that you may bring them down.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C22V29">&nbsp;</a>For you are my lamp, Yahweh.
</div>
<div class="q2">Yahweh will light up my darkness.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 30</span><a name="C22V30">&nbsp;</a>For by you, I run against a troop.
</div>
<div class="q2">By my God, I leap over a wall.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 31</span><a name="C22V31">&nbsp;</a>As for God, his way is perfect.
</div>
<div class="q2">Yahweh’s word is tested.
</div>
<div class="q2">He is a shield to all those who take refuge in him.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 32</span><a name="C22V32">&nbsp;</a>For who is God, besides Yahweh?
</div>
<div class="q2">Who is a rock, besides our God?
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 33</span><a name="C22V33">&nbsp;</a>God is my strong fortress.
</div>
<div class="q2">He makes my way perfect.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 34</span><a name="C22V34">&nbsp;</a>He makes his feet like hinds’ feet,
</div>
<div class="q2">and sets me on my high places.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 35</span><a name="C22V35">&nbsp;</a>He teaches my hands to war,
</div>
<div class="q2">so that my arms bend a bow of brass.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 36</span><a name="C22V36">&nbsp;</a>You have also given me the shield of your salvation.
</div>
<div class="q2">Your gentleness has made me great.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 37</span><a name="C22V37">&nbsp;</a>You have enlarged my steps under me.
</div>
<div class="q2">My feet have not slipped.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 38</span><a name="C22V38">&nbsp;</a>I have pursued my enemies and destroyed them.
</div>
<div class="q2">I didn’t turn again until they were consumed.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 39</span><a name="C22V39">&nbsp;</a>I have consumed them,
</div>
<div class="q2">and struck them through,
</div>
<div class="q2">so that they can’t arise.
</div>
<div class="q2">Yes, they have fallen under my feet.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 40</span><a name="C22V40">&nbsp;</a>For you have armed me with strength for the battle.
</div>
<div class="q2">You have subdued under me those who rose up against me.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 41</span><a name="C22V41">&nbsp;</a>You have also made my enemies turn their backs to me,
</div>
<div class="q2">that I might cut off those who hate me.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 42</span><a name="C22V42">&nbsp;</a>They looked, but there was no one to save;
</div>
<div class="q2">even to Yahweh, but he didn’t answer them.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 43</span><a name="C22V43">&nbsp;</a>Then I beat them as small as the dust of the earth.
</div>
<div class="q2">I crushed them as the mire of the streets, and spread them abroad.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 44</span><a name="C22V44">&nbsp;</a>You also have delivered me from the strivings of my people.
</div>
<div class="q2">You have kept me to be the head of the nations.
</div>
<div class="q2">A people whom I have not known will serve me.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 45</span><a name="C22V45">&nbsp;</a>The foreigners will submit themselves to me.
</div>
<div class="q2">As soon as they hear of me, they will obey me.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 46</span><a name="C22V46">&nbsp;</a>The foreigners will fade away,
</div>
<div class="q2">and will come trembling out of their close places.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 47</span><a name="C22V47">&nbsp;</a>Yahweh lives!

<div class="q2">Blessed be my rock!

<div class="q1">Exalted be God, the rock of my salvation,
</div>
<div class="q2"> <span class="verse"> 48</span><a name="C22V48">&nbsp;</a>even the God who executes vengeance for me,

<div class="q1">Yes, you lift me up above those who rise up against me.

<div class="q2">You deliver me from the violent man.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 50</span><a name="C22V50">&nbsp;</a>Therefore I will give thanks to you, Yahweh, among the nations,
