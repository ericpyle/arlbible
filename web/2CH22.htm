 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C22V1">&nbsp;</a>The inhabitants of Jerusalem made Ahaziah his youngest son king in his place, because the band of men
who came with the Arabians to the camp had slain all the oldest. So Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of
Judah reigned.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C22V2">&nbsp;</a>Ahaziah was forty-two years old when he began to reign, and he reigned one year in Jerusalem. His mother’s
name was Athaliah the daughter of Omri.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C22V3">&nbsp;</a>He also walked in the ways of Ahab’s house, because his mother was his counselor in acting wickedly.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C22V4">&nbsp;</a>He did that which was evil in Yahweh’s sight, as did Ahab’s house, for they were his counselors after
the death of his father, to his destruction.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C22V5">&nbsp;</a>He also followed their counsel, and went with Jehoram the son of Ahab king of Israel to war against Hazael
king of Syria at Ramoth Gilead, and the Syrians wounded Joram.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C22V6">&nbsp;</a>He returned to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds which they had given him at Ramah, when he fought against
Hazael king of Syria. Azariah the son of Jehoram king of Judah went down to see Jehoram the son of Ahab
in Jezreel, because he was sick.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C22V7">&nbsp;</a>Now the destruction of Ahaziah was of God, in that he went to Joram; for when he had come, he went out
with Jehoram against Jehu the son of Nimshi, whom Yahweh had anointed to cut off Ahab’s house.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C22V8">&nbsp;</a>When Jehu was executing judgment on Ahab’s house, he found the princes of Judah and the sons of the brothers
of Ahaziah, serving Ahaziah, and killed them.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C22V9">&nbsp;</a>He sought Ahaziah, and they caught him (now he was hiding in Samaria), and they brought him to Jehu,
and killed him; and they buried him, for they said, “He is the son of Jehoshaphat, who sought Yahweh
with all his heart.” The house of Ahaziah had no power to hold the kingdom.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C22V10">&nbsp;</a>Now when Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was dead, she arose and destroyed all the royal
offspring<a href="#FN1"><span class="notemark">*</span><span class="popup">or, seed</span></a>
 of the house of Judah.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C22V11">&nbsp;</a>But Jehoshabeath, the king’s daughter, took Joash the son of Ahaziah, and stealthily rescued him from
among the king’s sons who were slain, and put him and his nurse in the bedroom. So Jehoshabeath, the
daughter of king Jehoram, the wife of Jehoiada the priest (for she was the sister of Ahaziah), hid him
from Athaliah, so that she didn’t kill him.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C22V12">&nbsp;</a>He was with them hidden in God’s house six years while Athaliah reigned over the land.
