 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C9V1">&nbsp;</a>And he answered me, and said, Measure you diligently within yourself: and when you see that a certain
part of the signs are past, which have been told you beforehand,
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C9V2">&nbsp;</a>then shall you understand, that it is the very time, wherein the Most High will visit the world which
was made by him.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C9V3">&nbsp;</a>And when there shall be seen in the world earthquakes, disquietude of peoples, devices of nations, wavering
of leaders, disquietude of princes,
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C9V4">&nbsp;</a>then shall you understand, that the Most High spoke of these things from the days that were aforetime
from the beginning.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C9V5">&nbsp;</a>For like as of all that is made in the world, the beginning

</span></a>
 is evident, and the end manifest;
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C9V6">&nbsp;</a>so also are the times of the Most High: the beginnings are manifest in wonders and mighty works, and
the end in effects and signs.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C9V7">&nbsp;</a>And everyone that shall be saved, and shall be able to escape by his wotks, or by faith, whereby he has
believed,
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C9V8">&nbsp;</a>shall be preserved from the said perils, and shall see my salvation in my land, and within my borders,
which I have sanctified for me from the beginning.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C9V9">&nbsp;</a>Then shall they be amazed, which now have abused my ways: and they that have cast them away despitefully
shall dwell in torments.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C9V10">&nbsp;</a>For as many as in their life have received benefits, and yet have not known me;
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C9V11">&nbsp;</a>and as many as have scorned my law, while they had yet liberty, and, when as yet place of repentance
was open to them, understood not, but despised

<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C9V14">&nbsp;</a>And I answered and said,
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C9V15">&nbsp;</a>I have said before, and now do speak, and will speak it also hereafter, that there be more of them which
perish, than of the which will be saved:

<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C9V17">&nbsp;</a>And he answered me, saying, Like as the field is, so also the seed; and as the flowers be, such are the

 judgement
<span class="add">thereon;
</span> and as is the husbandman, so is his threshing floor also. For there was a time in the world,
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C9V18">&nbsp;</a>even then when I was preparing for them that now live, before the world was made for them to dwell in;
and then no man spoke against me,
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C9V19">&nbsp;</a>for
<a href="#FN6"><span class="notemark">††</span><span class="popup">So the Syriac.
</span></a>
 there was not any: but now they which are created in this world that is prepared, both

 with a table that fails not, and a law which is unsearchable, are corrupted in their manners.
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C9V20">&nbsp;</a>So I considered my world, and, behold, it was destroyed, and my earth, and, behold, it was in peril,
because of the devices that were come into it.
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C9V21">&nbsp;</a>And I saw, and spared them, but not greatly, and saved me a grape out of a cluster, and a plant out of

 a great forest.
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C9V22">&nbsp;</a>Let the multitude perish then, which was born in vain; and let my grape be saved, and my plant; for with
great labor have I made them perfect.
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C9V23">&nbsp;</a>Nevertheless if you will cease yet seven days more, (howbeit you shall not fast in them,
 <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C9V24">&nbsp;</a>but shall go into a field of flowers, where no house is builded, and eat only of the flowers of the field;
and you shall taste no flesh, and shall drink no wine, but
<span class="add">shall eat
</span> flowers only;)
 <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C9V25">&nbsp;</a>and pray to the Most High continually, then will I come and talk with you.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C9V26">&nbsp;</a>So I went my way, like as he commanded me, into the field which is called

</span></a>
 Ardat; and there I sat among the flowers, and did eat of the herbs of the field, and the meat of the
same satisfied me.
 <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C9V27">&nbsp;</a>And it came to pass after seven days that I lay upon the grass, and my heart was vexed again, like as
before:
 <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C9V28">&nbsp;</a>and my mouth was opened, and I began to speak before the Lord Most High, and said,
 <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C9V29">&nbsp;</a>O Lord, you did show yourself among us, to our fathers in the wilderness, when they went forth out of
Egypt, and when they came into the wilderness, where no man treadeth and that bears no fruit;
 <span class="verse"> 30</span><a name="C9V30">&nbsp;</a>and you did say, Hear me, you Israel; and mark my words, O seed of Jacob.
 <span class="verse"> 31</span><a name="C9V31">&nbsp;</a>For, behold, I sow my law in you, and it shall bring forth fruit in you, and you⌃ shall be glorified
in it for ever.
 <span class="verse"> 32</span><a name="C9V32">&nbsp;</a>But our fathers, which received the law, kept it not, and observed not the statutes: and the fruit of
the law did not perish, neither could it, for it was your;
 <span class="verse"> 33</span><a name="C9V33">&nbsp;</a>yet they that received it perished, because they kept not the thing that was sown in them.
 <span class="verse"> 34</span><a name="C9V34">&nbsp;</a>And, behold, it is a custom, that when the ground has received seed, or the sea a ship, or any vessel
meat or drink, and when it comes to pass that that which is sown, or that which is launched,
 <span class="verse"> 35</span><a name="C9V35">&nbsp;</a>or the things which have been received, should come to an end, these come to an end, but the receptacles
remain: yet with us it has not happened so.
 <span class="verse"> 36</span><a name="C9V36">&nbsp;</a>For we that have received the law shall perish by sin, and our heart also which received it.
 <span class="verse"> 37</span><a name="C9V37">&nbsp;</a>Notwithstanding the law perishes not, but remains in its honor.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 38</span><a name="C9V38">&nbsp;</a>And when I spoke these things in my heart, I looked about me with mine eyes, and upon the right side
I saw a woman, and, behold, she mourned and wept with a loud voice, and was much grieved in mind, and
her clothes were tore, and she had ashes upon her head.
 <span class="verse"> 39</span><a name="C9V39">&nbsp;</a>Then let I my thoughts go wherein I was occupied, and turned me to her,
 <span class="verse"> 40</span><a name="C9V40">&nbsp;</a>and said to her, Why do you weep? and why are you grieved in your mind?
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 41</span><a name="C9V41">&nbsp;</a>And she said to me, Let me alone, my Lord, that I may bewail myself, and add to my sorrow, for I am sore
vexed in my mind, and brought very low.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 42</span><a name="C9V42">&nbsp;</a>And I said to her, What aileth you? Tell me.
 <span class="verse"> 43</span><a name="C9V43">&nbsp;</a>She said to me, I your servant was barren, and had no child, though I had a husband thirty years.
 <span class="verse"> 44</span><a name="C9V44">&nbsp;</a>And every hour and every day these thirty years did I make my prayer to the Most High day and night.
 <span class="verse"> 45</span><a name="C9V45">&nbsp;</a>And it came to pass after thirty years that God heard me your handmaid, and looked upon my low estate,
and considered my trouble, and gave me a son: and I rejoiced in him greatly, I and my husband, and all

 neighbors: and we gave great honor to the Mighty.
 <span class="verse"> 46</span><a name="C9V46">&nbsp;</a>And I nourished him with great travail.
 <span class="verse"> 47</span><a name="C9V47">&nbsp;</a>So when he grew up, and I came to take him a wife, I made him a feast day.
