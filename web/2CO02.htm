 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C2V1">&nbsp;</a>But I determined this for myself, that I would not come to you again in sorrow.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C2V2">&nbsp;</a>For if I make you sorry, then who will make me glad but he who is made sorry by me?
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C2V3">&nbsp;</a>And I wrote this very thing to you, so that, when I came, I wouldn’t have sorrow from them of whom I
ought to rejoice; having confidence in you all, that my joy would be shared by all of you.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C2V4">&nbsp;</a>For out of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote to you with many tears, not that you should be
made sorry, but that you might know the love that I have so abundantly for you.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C2V5">&nbsp;</a>But if any has caused sorrow, he has caused sorrow, not to me, but in part (that I not press too heavily)
to you all.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C2V6">&nbsp;</a>This punishment which was inflicted by the many is sufficient for such a one;
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C2V7">&nbsp;</a>so that on the contrary you should rather forgive him and comfort him, lest by any means such a one should
be swallowed up with his excessive sorrow.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C2V8">&nbsp;</a>Therefore I beg you to confirm your love toward him.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C2V9">&nbsp;</a>For to this end I also wrote, that I might know the proof of you, whether you are obedient in all things.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C2V10">&nbsp;</a>Now I also forgive whomever you forgive anything. For if indeed I have forgiven anything, I have forgiven
that one for your sakes in the presence of Christ,
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C2V11">&nbsp;</a>that no advantage may be gained over us by Satan; for we are not ignorant of his schemes.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C2V12">&nbsp;</a>Now when I came to Troas for the Good News of Christ, and when a door was opened to me in the Lord,
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C2V13">&nbsp;</a>I had no relief for my spirit, because I didn’t find Titus, my brother, but taking my leave of them,
I went out into Macedonia.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C2V14">&nbsp;</a>Now thanks be to God, who always leads us in triumph in Christ, and reveals through us the sweet aroma
of his knowledge in every place.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C2V15">&nbsp;</a>For we are a sweet aroma of Christ to God, in those who are saved, and in those who perish;
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C2V16">&nbsp;</a>to the one a stench from death to death; to the other a sweet aroma from life to life. Who is sufficient
for these things?
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C2V17">&nbsp;</a>For we are not as so many, peddling the word of God. But as of sincerity, but as of God, in the sight
of God, we speak in Christ.
