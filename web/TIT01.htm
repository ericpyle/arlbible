<div class="mt1">Paul’s Letter to Titus
</div>
<div class="chapterlabel"> 1</div><div class="p">
 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C1V1">&nbsp;</a>Paul, a servant of God, and an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the faith of God’s chosen ones,
and the knowledge of the truth which is according to godliness,
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C1V2">&nbsp;</a>in hope of eternal life, which God, who can’t lie, promised before time began;
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C1V3">&nbsp;</a>but in his own time revealed his word in the message with which I was entrusted according to the commandment
of God our Savior;
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C1V4">&nbsp;</a>to Titus, my true child according to a common faith: Grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and
the Lord Jesus Christ our Savior.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C1V5">&nbsp;</a>I left you in Crete for this reason, that you would set in order the things that were lacking, and appoint
elders in every city, as I directed you;
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C1V6">&nbsp;</a>if anyone is blameless, the husband of one wife, having children who believe, who are not accused of
loose or unruly behavior.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C1V7">&nbsp;</a>For the overseer must be blameless, as God’s steward; not self-pleasing, not easily angered, not given
to wine, not violent, not greedy for dishonest gain;
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C1V8">&nbsp;</a>but given to hospitality, a lover of good, sober minded, fair, holy, self-controlled;
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C1V9">&nbsp;</a>holding to the faithful word which is according to the teaching, that he may be able to exhort in the
sound doctrine, and to convict those who contradict him.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C1V10">&nbsp;</a>For there are also many unruly men, vain talkers and deceivers, especially those of the circumcision,
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C1V11">&nbsp;</a>whose mouths must be stopped; men who overthrow whole houses, teaching things which they ought not, for
dishonest gain’s sake.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C1V12">&nbsp;</a>One of them, a prophet of their own, said, “Cretans are always liars, evil beasts, and idle gluttons.”
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C1V13">&nbsp;</a>This testimony is true. For this cause, reprove them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith,
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C1V14">&nbsp;</a>not paying attention to Jewish fables and commandments of men who turn away from the truth.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C1V15">&nbsp;</a>To the pure, all things are pure; but to those who are defiled and unbelieving, nothing is pure; but
both their mind and their conscience are defiled.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C1V16">&nbsp;</a>They profess that they know God, but by their deeds they deny him, being abominable, disobedient, and
unfit for any good work.
