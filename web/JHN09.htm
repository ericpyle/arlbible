<div class="chapterlabel"> 9</div><div class="p">
 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C9V1">&nbsp;</a>As he passed by, he saw a man blind from birth.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C9V2">&nbsp;</a>His disciples asked him, “Rabbi, who sinned, this man or his parents, that he was born blind?”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C9V3">&nbsp;</a>Jesus answered,
<span class="wj">“Neither did this man sin, nor his parents; but, that the works of God might be revealed in him.
</span> <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C9V4">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">I must work the works of him who sent me, while it is day. The night is coming, when no one can work.
</span> <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C9V5">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">While I am in the world, I am the light of the world.”</span> <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C9V6">&nbsp;</a>When he had said this, he spat on the ground, made mud with the saliva, anointed the blind man’s eyes
with the mud,
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C9V7">&nbsp;</a>and said to him,
<span class="wj">“Go, wash in the pool of Siloam”</span> (which means “Sent”). So he went away, washed, and came back seeing.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C9V8">&nbsp;</a>The neighbors therefore, and those who saw that he was blind before, said, “Isn’t this he who sat and
begged?”
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C9V9">&nbsp;</a>Others were saying, “It is he.” Still others were saying, “He looks like him.”
</div>
<div class="p">He said, “I am he.”
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C9V10">&nbsp;</a>They therefore were asking him, “How were your eyes opened?”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C9V11">&nbsp;</a>He answered, “A man called Jesus made mud, anointed my eyes, and said to me,
<span class="wj">‘Go to the pool of Siloam, and wash.’</span> So I went away and washed, and I received sight.”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C9V12">&nbsp;</a>Then they asked him, “Where is he?”
</div>
<div class="p">He said, “I don’t know.”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C9V13">&nbsp;</a>They brought him who had been blind to the Pharisees.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C9V14">&nbsp;</a>It was a Sabbath when Jesus made the mud and opened his eyes.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C9V15">&nbsp;</a>Again therefore the Pharisees also asked him how he received his sight. He said to them, “He put mud
on my eyes, I washed, and I see.”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C9V16">&nbsp;</a>Some therefore of the Pharisees said, “This man is not from God, because he doesn’t keep the Sabbath.”
Others said, “How can a man who is a sinner do such signs?” There was division among them.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C9V17">&nbsp;</a>Therefore they asked the blind man again, “What do you say about him, because he opened your eyes?”
</div>
<div class="p">He said, “He is a prophet.”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C9V18">&nbsp;</a>The Jews therefore did not believe concerning him, that he had been blind, and had received his sight,
until they called the parents of him who had received his sight,
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C9V19">&nbsp;</a>and asked them, “Is this your son, whom you say was born blind? How then does he now see?”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C9V20">&nbsp;</a>His parents answered them, “We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind;
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C9V21">&nbsp;</a>but how he now sees, we don’t know; or who opened his eyes, we don’t know. He is of age. Ask him. He
will speak for himself.”
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C9V22">&nbsp;</a>His parents said these things because they feared the Jews; for the Jews had already agreed that if any
man would confess him as Christ, he would be put out of the synagogue.
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C9V23">&nbsp;</a>Therefore his parents said, “He is of age. Ask him.”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C9V24">&nbsp;</a>So they called the man who was blind a second time, and said to him, “Give glory to God. We know that
this man is a sinner.”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C9V25">&nbsp;</a>He therefore answered, “I don’t know if he is a sinner. One thing I do know: that though I was blind,
now I see.”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C9V26">&nbsp;</a>They said to him again, “What did he do to you? How did he open your eyes?”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C9V27">&nbsp;</a>He answered them, “I told you already, and you didn’t listen. Why do you want to hear it again? You don’t
also want to become his disciples, do you?”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C9V28">&nbsp;</a>They insulted him and said, “You are his disciple, but we are disciples of Moses.
 <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C9V29">&nbsp;</a>We know that God has spoken to Moses. But as for this man, we don’t know where he comes from.”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 30</span><a name="C9V30">&nbsp;</a>The man answered them, “How amazing! You don’t know where he comes from, yet he opened my eyes.
 <span class="verse"> 31</span><a name="C9V31">&nbsp;</a>We know that God doesn’t listen to sinners, but if anyone is a worshiper of God, and does his will, he
listens to him.<a href="#FN1"><span class="notemark"></span><span class="popup">+ Psalm 66:18, Proverbs 15:29; 28:9</span></a>
 <span class="verse"> 32</span><a name="C9V32">&nbsp;</a>Since the world began it has never been heard of that anyone opened the eyes of someone born blind.
 <span class="verse"> 33</span><a name="C9V33">&nbsp;</a>If this man were not from God, he could do nothing.”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 34</span><a name="C9V34">&nbsp;</a>They answered him, “You were altogether born in sins, and do you teach us?” They threw him out.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 35</span><a name="C9V35">&nbsp;</a>Jesus heard that they had thrown him out, and finding him, he said,
<span class="wj">“Do you believe in the Son of God?”</span></div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 36</span><a name="C9V36">&nbsp;</a>He answered, “Who is he, Lord, that I may believe in him?”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 37</span><a name="C9V37">&nbsp;</a>Jesus said to him,
<span class="wj">“You have both seen him, and it is he who speaks with you.”</span></div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 38</span><a name="C9V38">&nbsp;</a>He said, “Lord, I believe!” and he worshiped him.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 39</span><a name="C9V39">&nbsp;</a>Jesus said,
<span class="wj">“I came into this world for judgment, that those who don’t see may see; and that those who see may become
blind.”</span></div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 40</span><a name="C9V40">&nbsp;</a>Those of the Pharisees who were with him heard these things, and said to him, “Are we also blind?”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 41</span><a name="C9V41">&nbsp;</a>Jesus said to them,
<span class="wj">“If you were blind, you would have no sin; but now you say, ‘We see.’ Therefore your sin remains.</span></div>
