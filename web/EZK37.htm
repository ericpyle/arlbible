<div class="chapterlabel"> 37</div><div class="p">
 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C37V1">&nbsp;</a>Yahweh’s hand was on me, and he brought me out in Yahweh’s Spirit, and set me down in the middle of the
valley; and it was full of bones.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C37V2">&nbsp;</a>He caused me to pass by them all around: and behold, there were very many in the open valley; and behold,
they were very dry.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C37V3">&nbsp;</a>He said to me, “Son of man, can these bones live?”
</div>
<div class="p">I answered, “Lord Yahweh, you know.”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C37V4">&nbsp;</a>Again he said to me, “Prophesy over these bones, and tell them, ‘You dry bones, hear Yahweh’s word.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C37V5">&nbsp;</a>Thus says the Lord Yahweh to these bones: “Behold, I will cause breath to enter into you, and you will
live.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C37V6">&nbsp;</a>I will lay sinews on you, and will bring up flesh on you, and cover you with skin, and put breath in
you, and you will live. Then you will know that I am Yahweh.”’”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C37V7">&nbsp;</a>So I prophesied as I was commanded: and as I prophesied, there was a noise, and behold, an earthquake;
and the bones came together, bone to its bone.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C37V8">&nbsp;</a>I saw, and, behold, there were sinews on them, and flesh came up, and skin covered them above; but there
was no breath in them.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C37V9">&nbsp;</a>Then he said to me, “Prophesy to the wind, prophesy, son of man, and tell the wind, ‘Thus says the Lord
Yahweh: “Come from the four winds, breath, and breathe on these slain, that they may live.”’”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C37V10">&nbsp;</a>So I prophesied as he commanded me, and the breath came into them, and they lived, and stood up on their
feet, an exceedingly great army.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C37V11">&nbsp;</a>Then he said to me, “Son of man, these bones are the whole house of Israel. Behold, they say, ‘Our bones
are dried up, and our hope is lost. We are completely cut off.’
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C37V12">&nbsp;</a>Therefore prophesy, and tell them, ‘Thus says the Lord Yahweh: “Behold, I will open your graves, and
cause you to come up out of your graves, my people; and I will bring you into the land of Israel.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C37V13">&nbsp;</a>You will know that I am Yahweh, when I have opened your graves, and caused you to come up out of your
graves, my people.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C37V14">&nbsp;</a>I will put my Spirit in you, and you will live, and I will place you in your own land: and you will know
that I, Yahweh, have spoken it and performed it,” says Yahweh.’”
</div>
<div class="b"></div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C37V15">&nbsp;</a>Yahweh’s word came again to me, saying,
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C37V16">&nbsp;</a>“You, son of man, take one stick, and write on it, ‘For Judah, and for the children of Israel his companions.’
Then take another stick, and write on it, ‘For Joseph, the stick of Ephraim, and for all the house of
Israel his companions.’
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C37V17">&nbsp;</a>Then join them for yourself to one another into one stick, that they may become one in your hand.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C37V18">&nbsp;</a>“When the children of your people speak to you, saying, ‘Won’t you show us what you mean by these?’
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C37V19">&nbsp;</a>tell them, ‘Thus says the Lord Yahweh: “Behold, I will take the stick of Joseph, which is in the hand
of Ephraim, and the tribes of Israel his companions; and I will put them with it, with the stick of Judah,
and make them one stick, and they will be one in my hand.
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C37V20">&nbsp;</a>The sticks whereon you write will be in your hand before their eyes.”’
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C37V21">&nbsp;</a>Say to them, ‘Thus says the Lord Yahweh: “Behold, I will take the children of Israel from among the nations,
where they are gone, and will gather them on every side, and bring them into their own land.
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C37V22">&nbsp;</a>I will make them one nation in the land, on the mountains of Israel; and one king will be king to them
all; and they will be no more two nations, neither will they be divided into two kingdoms any more at
all;
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C37V23">&nbsp;</a>neither will they defile themselves any more with their idols, nor with their detestable things, nor
with any of their transgressions; but I will save them out of all their dwelling places, in which they
have sinned, and will cleanse them. So they will be my people, and I will be their God.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C37V24">&nbsp;</a>“‘“My servant David will be king over them; and they all will have one shepherd. They will also walk
in my ordinances, and observe my statutes, and do them.
 <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C37V25">&nbsp;</a>They will dwell in the land that I have given to Jacob my servant, in which your fathers lived; and they
will dwell therein, they, and their children, and their children’s children, forever. David my servant
will be their prince for ever.
 <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C37V26">&nbsp;</a>Moreover I will make a covenant of peace with them. It will be an everlasting covenant with them; and
I will place them, and multiply them, and will set my sanctuary among them forever more.
 <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C37V27">&nbsp;</a>My tent also will be with them; and I will be their God, and they will be my people.
 <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C37V28">&nbsp;</a>The nations will know that I am Yahweh who sanctifies Israel, when my sanctuary is among them forever
more.”’”
