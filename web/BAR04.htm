 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C4V1">&nbsp;</a>This is the book of the commandments of God, and the law that endures for ever: all they that hold it
fast
<span class="add">are appointed
</span> to life; but such as leave it shall die.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C4V2">&nbsp;</a>Turn you, O Jacob, and take hold of it: walk towards her shining in the presence of the light thereof.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C4V3">&nbsp;</a>Give not your glory to another, nor the things that are profitable to you to a strange nation.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C4V4">&nbsp;</a>O Israel, happy are we: for the things that are pleasing to God are made known to us.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C4V5">&nbsp;</a>Be of good cheer, my people, the memorial of Israel.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C4V6">&nbsp;</a>You⌃ were sold to the nations,
<span class="add">but
</span> not for destruction: because you⌃ moved God to wrath, you⌃ were delivered to your adversaries.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C4V7">&nbsp;</a>For you⌃ provoked him that made you by sacrificing to demons, and not to God.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C4V8">&nbsp;</a>You⌃ forgat the everlasting God, that brought you up; you⌃ grieved also Jerusalem, that nursed you.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C4V9">&nbsp;</a>For she saw the wrath that is come upon you from God, and said, Hearken, you⌃
<span class="add">women
</span> that dwell about Sion: for God has brought upon me great mourning;
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C4V10">&nbsp;</a>for I have seen the captivity of my sons and daughters, which the Everlasting has brought upon them.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C4V11">&nbsp;</a>For with joy did I nourish them; but sent them away with weeping and mourning.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C4V12">&nbsp;</a>Let no man rejoice over me, a widow, and forsaken of many: for the sins of my children am I left desolate;
because they turned aside from the law of God,
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C4V13">&nbsp;</a>and had no regard to his statutes, neither walked they in the ways of God’s commandments, nor trod in
the paths of discipline in his righteousness.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C4V14">&nbsp;</a>Let them that dwell about Sion come, and remember you⌃ the captivity of my sons and daughters, which
the Everlasting has brought upon them.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C4V15">&nbsp;</a>For he has brought a nation upon them from far, a shameless nation, and of a strange language,

</span></a>
 who neither reverenced old man, nor pitied child.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C4V16">&nbsp;</a>And they have carried away the dear beloved sons of the widow, and left her that was alone desolate of
her daughters.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C4V17">&nbsp;</a>But I, what can I help you?
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C4V18">&nbsp;</a>For he that brought these plagues upon you will deliver you from the hand of your enemies.
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C4V19">&nbsp;</a>Go your way, O my children, go your way: for I am left desolate.
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C4V20">&nbsp;</a>I have put off the garment of peace, and put upon me the sackcloth of my petition: I will cry to the
Everlasting as long as I live.
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C4V21">&nbsp;</a>Be of good cheer, O my children, cry to God, and he shall deliver you from the power and hand of the
enemies.
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C4V22">&nbsp;</a>For I have trusted in the Everlasting, that he will save you; and joy is come to me from the Holy One,
because of the mercy which shall soon come to you
<a href="#FN2"><span class="notemark">†</span><span class="popup">Or,
from your everlasting Saviour
</span></a>
 from the Everlasting your Saviour.
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C4V23">&nbsp;</a>For I sent you out with mourning and weeping: but God will give you to me again with joy and gladness
for ever.
 <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C4V24">&nbsp;</a>For like as now they that dwell about Sion have seen your captivity: so shall they see shortly your salvation
from

</span></a>
 our God, which shall come upon you with great glory, and brightness of the Everlasting.
 <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C4V25">&nbsp;</a>My children, suffer patiently the wrath that is come upon you from God: for your enemy has persecuted
you; but shortly you shall see his destruction, and shall tread upon their necks.
 <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C4V26">&nbsp;</a>My delicate ones have gone rough ways; they were taken away as a flock carried off by the enemies.
 <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C4V27">&nbsp;</a>Be of good cheer, O my children, and cry to God: for you⌃ shall be remembered of him that has brought
<span class="add">these things
</span> upon you.
 <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C4V28">&nbsp;</a>For as it was your mind to go astray from God:
<span class="add">so,
</span> return and seek him ten times more.
 <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C4V29">&nbsp;</a>For he that brought these plagues upon you shall bring you everlasting joy again with your salvation.
 <span class="verse"> 30</span><a name="C4V30">&nbsp;</a>Be of good cheer, O Jerusalem: for he that called you by name will comfort you.
 <span class="verse"> 31</span><a name="C4V31">&nbsp;</a>Miserable are they that afflicted you, and rejoiced at your fall.
 <span class="verse"> 32</span><a name="C4V32">&nbsp;</a>Miserable are the cities which your children served: miserable is she that received your sons.
 <span class="verse"> 33</span><a name="C4V33">&nbsp;</a>For as she rejoiced at your fall, and was glad of your ruin: so shall she be grieved for her own desolation.
 <span class="verse"> 34</span><a name="C4V34">&nbsp;</a>And I will take away her exultation in her great multitude, and her boasting shall be turned into mourning.
 <span class="verse"> 35</span><a name="C4V35">&nbsp;</a>For fire shall come upon her from the Everlasting, long to endure; and she shall be inhabited of

the word of the Holy One, rejoicing in the glory of God.
