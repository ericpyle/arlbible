them go, and by a strong hand he shall drive them out of his land.”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C6V2">&nbsp;</a>God spoke to Moses, and said to him, “I am Yahweh;
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C6V3">&nbsp;</a>and I appeared to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, as God Almighty; but by my name Yahweh I was not known
to them.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C6V4">&nbsp;</a>I have also established my covenant with them, to give them the land of Canaan, the land of their travels,
in which they lived as aliens.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C6V5">&nbsp;</a>Moreover I have heard the groaning of the children of Israel, whom the Egyptians keep in bondage, and
I have remembered my covenant.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C6V6">&nbsp;</a>Therefore tell the children of Israel, ‘I am Yahweh, and I will bring you out from under the burdens
of the Egyptians, and I will rid you out of their bondage, and I will redeem you with an outstretched
arm, and with great judgments:
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C6V7">&nbsp;</a>and I will take you to me for a people, and I will be to you a God; and you shall know that I am Yahweh
your God, who brings you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C6V8">&nbsp;</a>I will bring you into the land which I swore to give to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob; and I will give
it to you for a heritage: I am Yahweh.’”
