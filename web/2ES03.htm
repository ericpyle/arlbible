 <span class="verse" id="V1">1&nbsp;</span>In the thirties year after the ruin of the city, I Salathiel (the same is Esdras) was in Babylon, and lay troubled upon my bed, and my thoughts came up over my heart:  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span>for I saw the desolation of Sion, and the wealth of them that lived at Babylon.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>And my spirit was sore moved, so that I began to speak words full of fear to the Most High, and said,  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>O Lord that bear rule, did you not not speak at the beginning, when you did fashion the earth, and that yourself alone, and command the <a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> So the Syriac and Aethiopic. </span></a> dust.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>and it <a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> So the Syriac. </span></a> gave you Adam, a body without a soul? yet it was the workmanship of your hands, and you did breathe into him the breath of life, and he was made living before you.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>And you led him into paradise, which your right hand did plant, before ever the earth came forward.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>And to him you gave your one commandment: which he transgressed, and immediately you appointed death for him and in his generations; and there were born of him nations and tribes, peoples and kindred, out of number.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>And every nation walked after their own will, and did ungodly things before you, and despised <span class='add'>your commandments, </span> and you did not forbid them.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>Nevertheless again in process of time you brought the flood upon those that lived in the world, and destroyed them.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>And it came to pass that the same hap befell them; like as death was to Adam, so was the flood to these.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>Nevertheless one of them you left, Noah with his household, <span class='add'>even </span> all the righteous men <span class='add'>that came </span> of him.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>And it came to pass, that when those who lived upon the earth began to multiply, they multiplied also children, and peoples, and many nations, and began again to be more ungodly than the first.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>And it came to pass, when they did wickedly before you, you did choose you one from among them, whose name was Abraham;  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>and him you loved, and to him only you showed the end of the times secretly by night:  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>and made an everlasting covenant with him, promising him that you would never forsake his seed.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>And to him you gave Isaac, and to Isaac you gave Jacob and Esau. And you did set apart Jacob for yourself, but did put by Esau: and Jacob became a great multitude.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>And it came to pass, that when you led his seed out of Egypt, you brought them up to the mount Sinai.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>You bowed the heavens also, and did <a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> So some versions. Lat. set fast. </span></a> shake the earth, and movedst the whole world, and made the depths to tremble, and troubled the <span class='add'>course of that </span> age.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>And your glory went through four gates, of fire, and of earthquake, and of wind, and of cold; that you might give the law to the seed of Jacob, and the commandment to the generation of Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>And yet took you not away from them <span class='add'>their </span> <a href="#FN4" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> Or, corrupt </span></a> wicked heart, that your law might bring forth fruit in them.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>For the first Adam bearing a <a href="#FN5" class="notemark">**<span class="popup"> Or, corrupt </span></a> wicked heart transgressed, and was overcome; <span class='add'>and not he only, </span> but all they also that are born of him.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>Thus disease was made permanent; and the law was in the heart of the people along with the <a href="#FN6" class="notemark">††<span class="popup"> Or, corruptness </span></a> wickedness of the root; so the good departed away, and that which was <a href="#FN7" class="notemark">‡‡<span class="popup"> Or, corrupt </span></a> wicked abode still.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>So the times passed away, and the years were brought to an end: then did you raise you up a servant, called David,  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>whom you commanded to build a city to your name, and to offer oblations to you therein of your own.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>When this was done many years, then those who inhabited the city did evil,  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>in all things doing even as Adam and all his generations had done: for they also bare a <a href="#FN8" class="notemark">§§<span class="popup"> Or, corrupt </span></a> wicked heart:  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>and so you gave your city over into the hands of your enemies.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&nbsp;</span>And I said then in my heart, are their deeds any better that inhabit Babylon? and has she therefore dominion over Sion?  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&nbsp;</span>For it came to pass when I came hither, that I saw also impieties without number, and my soul saw many evil-doers in this thirties year, so that my heart failed me.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&nbsp;</span>For I have seen how you suffer them sinning, and have spared the ungodly doers, and have destroyed your people, and have preserved your enemies; and you have not signified  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&nbsp;</span>to any <a href="#FN9" class="notemark">***<span class="popup"> So the Syriac.
