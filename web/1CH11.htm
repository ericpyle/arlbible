 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C11V1">&nbsp;</a>Then all Israel gathered themselves to David to Hebron, saying, “Behold, we are your bone and your flesh.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C11V2">&nbsp;</a>In times past, even when Saul was king, it was you who led out and brought in Israel. Yahweh your God
said to you, ‘You shall be shepherd of my people Israel, and you shall be prince over my people Israel.’”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C11V3">&nbsp;</a>So all the elders of Israel came to the king to Hebron; and David made a covenant with them in Hebron
before Yahweh; and they anointed David king over Israel, according to Yahweh’s word by Samuel.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C11V4">&nbsp;</a>David and all Israel went to Jerusalem (also called Jebus); and the Jebusites, the inhabitants of the
land, were there.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C11V5">&nbsp;</a>The inhabitants of Jebus said to David, “You will not come in here.” Nevertheless David took the stronghold
of Zion. The same is David’s city.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C11V6">&nbsp;</a>David said, “Whoever strikes the Jebusites first shall be chief and captain.” Joab the son of Zeruiah
went up first, and was made chief.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C11V7">&nbsp;</a>David lived in the stronghold; therefore they called it David’s city.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C11V8">&nbsp;</a>He built the city all around, from Millo even around; and Joab repaired the rest of the city.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C11V9">&nbsp;</a>David grew greater and greater; for Yahweh of Armies was with him.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C11V10">&nbsp;</a>Now these are the chief of the mighty men whom David had, who showed themselves strong with him in his
kingdom, together with all Israel, to make him king, according to Yahweh’s word concerning Israel.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C11V11">&nbsp;</a>This is the number of the mighty men whom David had: Jashobeam, the son of a Hachmonite, the chief of
the thirty; he lifted up his spear against three hundred and killed them at one time.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C11V12">&nbsp;</a>After him was Eleazar the son of Dodo, the Ahohite, who was one of the three mighty men.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C11V13">&nbsp;</a>He was with David at Pasdammim, and there the Philistines were gathered together to battle, where there
was a plot of ground full of barley; and the people fled from before the Philistines.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C11V14">&nbsp;</a>They stood in the middle of the plot, defended it, and killed the Philistines; and Yahweh saved them
by a great victory.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C11V15">&nbsp;</a>Three of the thirty chief men went down to the rock to David, into the cave of Adullam; and the army
of the Philistines were encamped in the valley of Rephaim.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C11V16">&nbsp;</a>David was then in the stronghold, and the garrison of the Philistines was in Bethlehem at that time.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C11V17">&nbsp;</a>David longed, and said, “Oh that one would give me water to drink from the well of Bethlehem, which is
by the gate!”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C11V18">&nbsp;</a>The three broke through the army of the Philistines, and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem, that
was by the gate, and took it, and brought it to David; but David would not drink any of it, but poured
it out to Yahweh,
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C11V19">&nbsp;</a>and said, “My God forbid me, that I should do this! Shall I drink the blood of these men who have put
their lives in jeopardy?” For they risked their lives to bring it. Therefore he would not drink it. The
three mighty men did these things.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C11V20">&nbsp;</a>Abishai, the brother of Joab, he was chief of the three; for he lifted up his spear against three hundred
and killed them, and had a name among the three.
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C11V21">&nbsp;</a>Of the three, he was more honorable than the two, and was made their captain; however he wasn’t included
in the three.
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C11V22">&nbsp;</a>Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the son of a valiant man of Kabzeel, who had done mighty deeds, killed the
two sons of Ariel of Moab. He also went down and killed a lion in the middle of a pit on a snowy day.
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C11V23">&nbsp;</a>He killed an Egyptian, a man of great stature, five cubits<a href="#FN1"><span class="notemark">*</span><span class="popup">A cubit is the length from the tip of the middle finger to the elbow on a man’s arm, or about 18 inches
or 46 centimeters. Therefore this Egyptian was bout 7 feet and 6 inches or 2.28 meters tall.</span></a>
 high. In the Egyptian’s hand was a spear like a weaver’s beam; and he went down to him with a staff,
plucked the spear out of the Egyptian’s hand, and killed him with his own spear.
 <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C11V24">&nbsp;</a>Benaiah the son of Jehoiada did these things, and had a name among the three mighty men.
 <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C11V25">&nbsp;</a>Behold, he was more honorable than the thirty, but he didn’t attain to the three; and David set him over
his guard.
