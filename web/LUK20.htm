priests and scribes came to him with the elders.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C20V2">&nbsp;</a>They asked him, “Tell us: by what authority do you do these things? Or who is giving you this authority?”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C20V3">&nbsp;</a>He answered them,
<span class="wj">“I also will ask you one question. Tell me:
</span> <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C20V4">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">the baptism of John, was it from heaven, or from men?”</span></div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C20V5">&nbsp;</a>They reasoned with themselves, saying, “If we say, ‘From heaven,’ he will say, ‘Why didn’t you believe
him?’
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C20V6">&nbsp;</a>But if we say, ‘From men,’ all the people will stone us, for they are persuaded that John was a prophet.”
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C20V7">&nbsp;</a>They answered that they didn’t know where it was from.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C20V8">&nbsp;</a>Jesus said to them,
<span class="wj">“Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things.”</span></div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C20V9">&nbsp;</a>He began to tell the people this parable.
<span class="wj">“A
</span><a href="#FN2"><span class="notemark">†</span><span class="popup">NU (in brackets) and TR add “certain”</span></a>
<span class="wj">man planted a vineyard, and rented it out to some farmers, and went into another country for a long time.
</span> <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C20V10">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">At the proper season, he sent a servant to the farmers to collect his share of the fruit of the vineyard.
But the farmers beat him, and sent him away empty.
</span> <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C20V11">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">He sent yet another servant, and they also beat him, and treated him shamefully, and sent him away empty.
</span> <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C20V12">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">He sent yet a third, and they also wounded him, and threw him out.
</span> <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C20V13">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">The lord of the vineyard said, ‘What shall I do? I will send my beloved son. It may be that seeing him,
they will respect him.’</span></div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C20V14">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">“But when the farmers saw him, they reasoned among themselves, saying, ‘This is the heir. Come, let’s
kill him, that the inheritance may be ours.’
</span> <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C20V15">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">They threw him out of the vineyard, and killed him. What therefore will the lord of the vineyard do to
them?
</span> <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C20V16">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">He will come and destroy these farmers, and will give the vineyard to others.”</span></div>
<div class="p">When they heard it, they said, “May it never be!”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C20V17">&nbsp;</a>But he looked at them, and said,
<span class="wj">“Then what is this that is written,</span></div>
<div class="q1"><span class="wj">‘The stone which the builders rejected,</span></div>
<div class="q2"><span class="wj">the same was made the chief cornerstone?’</span><a href="#FN3"><span class="notemark"></span><span class="popup">+ Psalm 118:22

<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C20V19">&nbsp;</a>The chief priests and the scribes sought to lay hands on him that very hour, but they feared the people—for
they knew he had spoken this parable against them.
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C20V20">&nbsp;</a>They watched him, and sent out spies, who pretended to be righteous, that they might trap him in something
he said, so as to deliver him up to the power and authority of the governor.
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C20V21">&nbsp;</a>They asked him, “Teacher, we know that you say and teach what is right, and aren’t partial to anyone,
but truly teach the way of God.
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C20V22">&nbsp;</a>Is it lawful for us to pay taxes to Caesar, or not?”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C20V23">&nbsp;</a>But he perceived their craftiness, and said to them,
<span class="wj">“Why do you test me?
</span> <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C20V24">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Show me a denarius. Whose image and inscription are on it?”
</span></div>
<div class="p">They answered, “Caesar’s.”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C20V25">&nbsp;</a>He said to them,
<span class="wj">“Then give to Caesar the things that are Caesar’s, and to God the things that are God’s.”</span></div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C20V26">&nbsp;</a>They weren’t able to trap him in his words before the people. They marveled at his answer, and were silent.
 <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C20V27">&nbsp;</a>Some of the Sadducees came to him, those who deny that there is a resurrection.
 <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C20V28">&nbsp;</a>They asked him, “Teacher, Moses wrote to us that if a man’s brother dies having a wife, and he is childless,
his brother should take the wife, and raise up children for his brother.
 <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C20V29">&nbsp;</a>There were therefore seven brothers. The first took a wife, and died childless.
 <span class="verse"> 30</span><a name="C20V30">&nbsp;</a>The second took her as wife, and he died childless.
 <span class="verse"> 31</span><a name="C20V31">&nbsp;</a>The third took her, and likewise the seven all left no children, and died.
 <span class="verse"> 32</span><a name="C20V32">&nbsp;</a>Afterward the woman also died.
 <span class="verse"> 33</span><a name="C20V33">&nbsp;</a>Therefore in the resurrection whose wife of them will she be? For the seven had her as a wife.”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 34</span><a name="C20V34">&nbsp;</a>Jesus said to them,
<span class="wj">“The children of this age marry, and are given in marriage.
</span> <span class="verse"> 35</span><a name="C20V35">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">But those who are considered worthy to attain to that age and the resurrection from the dead, neither
marry, nor are given in marriage.
</span> <span class="verse"> 36</span><a name="C20V36">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">For they can’t die any more, for they are like the angels, and are children of God, being children of
the resurrection.
</span> <span class="verse"> 37</span><a name="C20V37">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">But that the dead are raised, even Moses showed at the bush, when he called the Lord ‘The God of Abraham,
the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.’

<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 39</span><a name="C20V39">&nbsp;</a>Some of the scribes answered, “Teacher, you speak well.”
 <span class="verse"> 40</span><a name="C20V40">&nbsp;</a>They didn’t dare to ask him any more questions.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 41</span><a name="C20V41">&nbsp;</a>He said to them,

<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 45</span><a name="C20V45">&nbsp;</a>In the hearing of all the people, he said to his disciples,
 <span class="verse"> 46</span><a name="C20V46">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">“Beware of the scribes, who like to walk in long robes, and love greetings in the marketplaces, the best
seats in the synagogues, and the best places at feasts;
