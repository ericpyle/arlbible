 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C7V1">&nbsp;</a>But the next day Holofernes gave command to all his army, and to all his people which were come to be
his allies, that they should remove their camp toward Bethulia, and take beforehand the ascents of the
hill country, and make war against the children of Israel.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C7V2">&nbsp;</a>And every mighty man of them removed that day, and the host of their men of war was a hundred and seventy
thousand footmen, and twelve thousand horsemen, beside the baggage, and the men that were afoot among
them, an exceeding great multitude.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C7V3">&nbsp;</a>And they encamped in the valley near to Bethulia, by the fountain, and they spread themselves in breadth
over Dothaim even to Belmaim, and in length from Bethulia to Cyamon, which is over against Esdraelon.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C7V4">&nbsp;</a>But the children of Israel, when they saw the multitude of them, were troubled exceedingly, and said
every one to his neighbor, Now shall these men lick up the face of all the earth; and neither the high
mountains, nor the valleys, nor the hills, shall be able to bear their weight.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C7V5">&nbsp;</a>And every man took up his weapons of war, and when they had kindled fires upon their towers, they remained
and watched all that night.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C7V6">&nbsp;</a>But on the second day Holofernes led out all his horse in the sight of the children of Israel which were
in Bethulia,
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C7V7">&nbsp;</a>and viewed the ascents to their city, and searched out the fountains of the waters, and seized upon them,
and set garrisons of men of war over them, and himself departed to his people.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C7V8">&nbsp;</a>And there came to him all the rulers of the children of Esau, and all the leaders of the people of Moab,
and the captains of the sea coast, and said,
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C7V9">&nbsp;</a>Let our lord now hear a word, that there be not an overthrow in your host.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C7V10">&nbsp;</a>For this people of the children of Israel do not trust in their spears, but in the height of the mountains
wherein they dwell, for it is not easy to come up to the tops of their mountains.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C7V11">&nbsp;</a>And now, my lord, fight not against them as men fight who join battle, and there shall not so much as
one man of your people perish.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C7V12">&nbsp;</a>Remain in your camp, and keep safe every man of your host, and let your servants get possession of the
fountain of water, which issues forth of the foot of the mountain:
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C7V13">&nbsp;</a>because all the inhabitants of Bethulia have their water thence; and thirst shall kill them, and they
shall give up their city: and we and our people will go up to the tops of the mountains that are near,
and will encamp upon them, to watch that not one man go out of the city.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C7V14">&nbsp;</a>And they shall be consumed with famine, they and their wives and their children, and before the sword
come against them they shall be laid low in the streets where they dwell.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C7V15">&nbsp;</a>And you shall render them an evil reward; because they rebelled, and met not your face in peace.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C7V16">&nbsp;</a>And their words were pleasing in the sight of Holofernes and in the sight of all his servants; and he
appointed to do as they had spoken.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C7V17">&nbsp;</a>And the army of the children of Ammon removed, and with them five thousand of the children of Asshur,
and they encamped in the valley, and seized upon the waters and the fountains of the waters of the children
of Israel.
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C7V18">&nbsp;</a>And the children of Esau went up with the children of Ammon, and encamped in the hill country over against
Dothaim: and they sent some of them toward the south, and toward the east, over against Ekrebel, which
is near to Chusi, that is upon the brook Mochmur; and the rest of the army of the Assyrians encamped
in the plain, and covered all the face of the land; and their tents and baggage were pitched upon it
in a great crowd, and they were an exceeding great multitude.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C7V19">&nbsp;</a>And the children of Israel cried to the Lord their God, for their spirit fainted; for all their enemies
had compassed them round about, and there was no way to escape out from among them.
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C7V20">&nbsp;</a>And all the army of Asshur remained about them, their footmen and their chariots and their horsemen,
four and thirty days; and all their vessels of water failed all the inhabitants of Bethulia.
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C7V21">&nbsp;</a>And the cisterns were emptied, and they had not water to drink their fill for one day: for they gave
them drink by measure.
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C7V22">&nbsp;</a>And their young children were out of heart, and the women and the young men fainted for thirst, and they
fell down in the streets of the city, and in the passages of the gates, and there was no longer any strength
in them.
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C7V23">&nbsp;</a>And all the people were gathered together against Ozias, and against the rulers of the city, the young
men and the women and the children, and they cried with a loud voice, and said before all the elders,
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C7V24">&nbsp;</a>God be judge between you and us: because you⌃ have done us great wrong, in that you⌃ have not spoken
words of peace with the children of Asshur.
 <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C7V25">&nbsp;</a>And now we have no helper: but God has sold us into their hands, that we should be laid low before them
with thirst and great destruction.
 <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C7V26">&nbsp;</a>And now call them to you, and deliver up the whole city for a prey to the people of Holofernes, and to
all his host.
 <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C7V27">&nbsp;</a>For it is better for us to be made a spoil to them: for we shall be servants, and our souls shall live,
and we shall not see the death of our babes before our eyes, and our wives and our children fainting
in death.
 <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C7V28">&nbsp;</a>We take to witness against you the heaven and the earth, and our God and the Lord of our fathers, which
punishes us according to our sins and the sins of our fathers, that he do not according as we have said
this day.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C7V29">&nbsp;</a>And there was great weeping of all with one consent in the midst of the assembly; and they cried to the
Lord God with a loud voice.
 <span class="verse"> 30</span><a name="C7V30">&nbsp;</a>And Ozias said to them, Brethren, be of good courage, let us yet endure five days, in the which space
the Lord our God shall turn his mercy toward us; for he will not forsake us utterly.
 <span class="verse"> 31</span><a name="C7V31">&nbsp;</a>But if these days pass, and there come no help to us, I will do according to your words.
 <span class="verse"> 32</span><a name="C7V32">&nbsp;</a>And he dispersed the people, every man to his own camp; and they went away to the walls and towers of
their city; and he sent the women and children into their houses: and they were brought very low in the
city.
