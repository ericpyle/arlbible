 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C2V1">&nbsp;</a>I lifted up my eyes, and saw, and behold, a man with a measuring line in his hand.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C2V2">&nbsp;</a>Then I asked, “Where are you going?”
</div>
<div class="p">He said to me, “To measure Jerusalem, to see what is its width and what is its length.”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C2V3">&nbsp;</a>Behold, the angel who talked with me went out, and another angel went out to meet him,
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C2V4">&nbsp;</a>and said to him, “Run, speak to this young man, saying, ‘Jerusalem will be inhabited as villages without
walls, because of the multitude of men and livestock in it.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C2V5">&nbsp;</a>For I,’ says Yahweh, ‘will be to her a wall of fire around it, and I will be the glory in the middle
of her.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C2V6">&nbsp;</a>Come! Come! Flee from the land of the north,’ says Yahweh; ‘for I have spread you abroad as the four
winds of the sky,’ says Yahweh.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C2V7">&nbsp;</a>‘Come, Zion! Escape, you who dwell with the daughter of Babylon.’
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C2V8">&nbsp;</a>For Yahweh of Armies says: ‘For honor he has sent me to the nations which plundered you; for he who touches
you touches the apple of his eye.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C2V9">&nbsp;</a>For, behold, I will shake my hand over them, and they will be a plunder to those who served them; and
you will know that Yahweh of Armies has sent me.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C2V10">&nbsp;</a>Sing and rejoice, daughter of Zion; for, behold, I come, and I will dwell within you,’ says Yahweh.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C2V11">&nbsp;</a>Many nations shall join themselves to Yahweh in that day, and shall be my people; and I will dwell among
you, and you shall know that Yahweh of Armies has sent me to you.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C2V12">&nbsp;</a>Yahweh will inherit Judah as his portion in the holy land, and will again choose Jerusalem.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C2V13">&nbsp;</a>Be silent, all flesh, before Yahweh; for he has roused himself from his holy habitation!”
