<div><a name="C6V0"><hr></a>
<div class="chapterlabel"> 6</div><div class="p">
 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C6V1">&nbsp;</a>It pleased Darius to set over the kingdom one hundred twenty satraps, who should be throughout the whole
kingdom;
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C6V2">&nbsp;</a>and over them three presidents, of whom Daniel was one; that these satraps might give account to them,
and that the king should have no damage.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C6V3">&nbsp;</a>Then this Daniel was distinguished above the presidents and the satraps, because an excellent spirit
was in him; and the king thought to set him over the whole realm.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C6V4">&nbsp;</a>Then the presidents and the satraps sought to find occasion against Daniel as touching the kingdom; but
they could find no occasion nor fault, because he was faithful, neither was there any error or fault
found in him.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C6V5">&nbsp;</a>Then these men said, “We won’t find any occasion against this Daniel, unless we find it against him concerning
the law of his God.”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C6V6">&nbsp;</a>Then these presidents and satraps assembled together to the king, and said thus to him, “King Darius,
live forever!
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C6V7">&nbsp;</a>All the presidents of the kingdom, the deputies and the satraps, the counselors and the governors, have
consulted together to establish a royal statute, and to make a strong decree, that whoever asks a petition
of any god or man for thirty days, except of you, O king, he shall be cast into the den of lions.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C6V8">&nbsp;</a>Now, O king, establish the decree, and sign the writing, that it not be changed, according to the law
of the Medes and Persians, which doesn’t alter.”
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C6V9">&nbsp;</a>Therefore king Darius signed the writing and the decree.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C6V10">&nbsp;</a>When Daniel knew that the writing was signed, he went into his house (now his windows were open in his
room toward Jerusalem) and he kneeled on his knees three times a day, and prayed, and gave thanks before
his God, as he did before.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C6V11">&nbsp;</a>Then these men assembled together, and found Daniel making petition and supplication before his God.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C6V12">&nbsp;</a>Then they came near, and spoke before the king concerning the king’s decree: “Haven’t you signed a decree
that every man who makes a petition to any god or man within thirty days, except to you, O king, shall
be cast into the den of lions?”
</div>
<div class="p">The king answered, “The thing is true, according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which doesn’t
alter.”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C6V13">&nbsp;</a>Then they answered and said before the king, “That Daniel, who is of the children of the captivity of
Judah, doesn’t respect you, O king, nor the decree that you have signed, but makes his petition three
times a day.”
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C6V14">&nbsp;</a>Then the king, when he heard these words, was very displeased, and set his heart on Daniel to deliver
him; and he labored until the going down of the sun to rescue him.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C6V15">&nbsp;</a>Then these men assembled together to the king, and said to the king, “Know, O king, that it is a law
of the Medes and Persians, that no decree nor statute which the king establishes may be changed.”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C6V16">&nbsp;</a>Then the king commanded, and they brought Daniel, and cast him into the den of lions. The king spoke
and said to Daniel, “Your God whom you serve continually, he will deliver you.”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C6V17">&nbsp;</a>A stone was brought, and laid on the mouth of the den; and the king sealed it with his own signet, and
with the signet of his lords; that nothing might be changed concerning Daniel.
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C6V18">&nbsp;</a>Then the king went to his palace, and passed the night fasting; neither were instruments of music brought
before him: and his sleep fled from him.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C6V19">&nbsp;</a>Then the king arose very early in the morning, and went in haste to the den of lions.
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C6V20">&nbsp;</a>When he came near to the den to Daniel, he cried with a lamentable voice; the king spoke and said to
Daniel, “Daniel, servant of the living God, is your God, whom you serve continually, able to deliver
you from the lions?”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C6V21">&nbsp;</a>Then Daniel said to the king, “O king, live forever!
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C6V22">&nbsp;</a>My God has sent his angel, and has shut the lions’ mouths, and they have not hurt me; because as before
him innocence was found in me; and also before you, O king, I have done no harm.”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C6V23">&nbsp;</a>Then the king was exceedingly glad, and commanded that they should take Daniel up out of the den. So
Daniel was taken up out of the den, and no kind of harm was found on him, because he had trusted in his
God.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C6V24">&nbsp;</a>The king commanded, and they brought those men who had accused Daniel, and they cast them into the den
of lions, them, their children, and their wives; and the lions mauled them, and broke all their bones
in pieces, before they came to the bottom of the den.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C6V25">&nbsp;</a>Then king Darius wrote to all the peoples, nations, and languages, who dwell in all the earth:
</div>
<div class="pi1">“Peace be multiplied to you.
</div>
<div class="pi1"> <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C6V26">&nbsp;</a>“I make a decree, that in all the dominion of my kingdom men tremble and fear before the God of Daniel;
</div>
<div class="q1">“for he is the living God,
</div>
<div class="q2">and steadfast forever,
</div>
<div class="q1">His kingdom that which will not be destroyed;
</div>
<div class="q2">and his dominion will be even to the end.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C6V27">&nbsp;</a>He delivers and rescues,
</div>
<div class="q2">and he works signs and wonders in heaven and in earth,
</div>
<div class="q2">who has delivered Daniel from the power of the lions.”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C6V28">&nbsp;</a>So this Daniel prospered in the reign of Darius, and in the reign of Cyrus the Persian.
