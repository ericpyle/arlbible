<div class="chapterlabel"> 2</div><div class="p">
 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C2V1">&nbsp;</a>Naomi had a relative of her husband’s, a mighty man of wealth, of the family of Elimelech, and his name
was Boaz.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C2V2">&nbsp;</a>Ruth the Moabitess said to Naomi, “Let me now go to the field, and glean among the ears of grain after
him in whose sight I find favor.”
</div>
<div class="p">She said to her, “Go, my daughter.”
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C2V3">&nbsp;</a>She went, and came and gleaned in the field after the reapers; and she happened to come to the portion
of the field belonging to Boaz, who was of the family of Elimelech.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C2V4">&nbsp;</a>Behold, Boaz came from Bethlehem, and said to the reapers, “May Yahweh be with you.”
</div>
<div class="p">They answered him, “May Yahweh bless you.”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C2V5">&nbsp;</a>Then Boaz said to his servant who was set over the reapers, “Whose young lady is this?”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C2V6">&nbsp;</a>The servant who was set over the reapers answered, “It is the Moabite lady who came back with Naomi out
of the country of Moab.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C2V7">&nbsp;</a>She said, ‘Please let me glean and gather after the reapers among the sheaves.’ So she came, and has
continued even from the morning until now, except that she rested a little in the house.”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C2V8">&nbsp;</a>Then Boaz said to Ruth, “Listen, my daughter. Don’t go to glean in another field, and don’t go from here,
but stay here close to my maidens.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C2V9">&nbsp;</a>Let your eyes be on the field that they reap, and go after them. Haven’t I commanded the young men not
to touch you? When you are thirsty, go to the vessels, and drink from that which the young men have drawn.”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C2V10">&nbsp;</a>Then she fell on her face, and bowed herself to the ground, and said to him, “Why have I found favor
in your sight, that you should take knowledge of me, since I am a foreigner?”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C2V11">&nbsp;</a>Boaz answered her, “I have been fully told about all that you have done to your mother-in-law since the
death of your husband, and how you have left your father and your mother, and the land of your birth,
and have come to a people that you didn’t know before.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C2V12">&nbsp;</a>May Yahweh repay your work, and a full reward be given to you from Yahweh, the God of Israel, under whose
wings you have come to take refuge.”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C2V13">&nbsp;</a>Then she said, “Let me find favor in your sight, my lord, because you have comforted me, and because
you have spoken kindly to your servant, though I am not as one of your servants.”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C2V14">&nbsp;</a>At meal time Boaz said to her, “Come here, and eat some bread, and dip your morsel in the vinegar.”
</div>
<div class="p">She sat beside the reapers, and they passed her parched grain, and she ate, and was satisfied, and left
some of it.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C2V15">&nbsp;</a>When she had risen up to glean, Boaz commanded his young men, saying, “Let her glean even among the sheaves,
and don’t reproach her.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C2V16">&nbsp;</a>Also pull out some for her from the bundles, and leave it. Let her glean, and don’t rebuke her.”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C2V17">&nbsp;</a>So she gleaned in the field until evening; and she beat out that which she had gleaned, and it was about
an ephah<a href="#FN1"><span class="notemark">*</span><span class="popup">1 ephah is about 22 liters or about 2/3 of a bushel</span></a>
 of barley.
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C2V18">&nbsp;</a>She took it up, and went into the city. Then her mother-in-law saw what she had gleaned; and she brought
out and gave to her that which she had left after she had enough.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C2V19">&nbsp;</a>Her mother-in-law said to her, “Where have you gleaned today? Where have you worked? Blessed be he who
noticed you.”
</div>
<div class="p">She told her mother-in-law with whom she had worked, “The man’s name with whom I worked today is Boaz.”
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C2V20">&nbsp;</a>Naomi said to her daughter-in-law, “May he be blessed by Yahweh, who has not left off his kindness to
the living and to the dead.” Naomi said to her, “The man is a close relative to us, one of our near kinsmen.”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C2V21">&nbsp;</a>Ruth the Moabitess said, “Yes, he said to me, ‘You shall stay close to my young men, until they have
finished all my harvest.’”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C2V22">&nbsp;</a>Naomi said to Ruth her daughter-in-law, “It is good, my daughter, that you go out with his maidens, and
that they not meet you in any other field.”
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C2V23">&nbsp;</a>So she stayed close to the maidens of Boaz, to glean to the end of barley harvest and of wheat harvest;
and she lived with her mother-in-law.
