according to your valuation,

twenty shekels, and for a female ten shekels.

shekels of silver, and for a female your valuation shall be three shekels of silver.

shekels, and for a female ten shekels.

assign a value to him. The priest shall assign a value according to his ability to pay.

animal for animal, then both it and that for which it is changed shall be holy.
