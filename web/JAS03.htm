 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C3V1">&nbsp;</a>Let not many of you be teachers, my brothers, knowing that we will receive heavier judgment.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C3V2">&nbsp;</a>For in many things we all stumble. If anyone doesn’t stumble in word, the same is a perfect man, able
to bridle the whole body also.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C3V3">&nbsp;</a>Indeed, we put bits into the horses’ mouths so that they may obey us, and we guide their whole body.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C3V4">&nbsp;</a>Behold,<a href="#FN1"><span class="notemark">*</span><span class="popup">“Behold”, from “ἰδοὺ”, means look at, take notice, observe, see, or gaze at. It is often used as an interjection.</span></a>
 the ships also, though they are so big and are driven by fierce winds, are yet guided by a very small
rudder, wherever the pilot desires.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C3V5">&nbsp;</a>So the tongue is also a little member, and boasts great things. See how a small fire can spread to a
large forest!
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C3V6">&nbsp;</a>And the tongue is a fire. The world of iniquity among our members is the tongue, which defiles the whole
body, and sets on fire the course of nature, and is set on fire by Gehenna.<a href="#FN2"><span class="notemark">†</span><span class="popup">or, Hell</span></a>
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C3V7">&nbsp;</a>For every kind of animal, bird, creeping thing, and sea creature, is tamed, and has been tamed by mankind;
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C3V8">&nbsp;</a>but nobody can tame the tongue. It is a restless evil, full of deadly poison.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C3V9">&nbsp;</a>With it we bless our God and Father, and with it we curse men, who are made in the image of God.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C3V10">&nbsp;</a>Out of the same mouth comes blessing and cursing. My brothers, these things ought not to be so.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C3V11">&nbsp;</a>Does a spring send out from the same opening fresh and bitter water?
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C3V12">&nbsp;</a>Can a fig tree, my brothers, yield olives, or a vine figs? Thus no spring yields both salt water and
fresh water.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C3V13">&nbsp;</a>Who is wise and understanding among you? Let him show by his good conduct that his deeds are done in
gentleness of wisdom.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C3V14">&nbsp;</a>But if you have bitter jealousy and selfish ambition in your heart, don’t boast and don’t lie against
the truth.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C3V15">&nbsp;</a>This wisdom is not that which comes down from above, but is earthly, sensual, and demonic.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C3V16">&nbsp;</a>For where jealousy and selfish ambition are, there is confusion and every evil deed.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C3V17">&nbsp;</a>But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceful, gentle, reasonable, full of mercy and
good fruits, without partiality, and without hypocrisy.
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C3V18">&nbsp;</a>Now the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace by those who make peace.
