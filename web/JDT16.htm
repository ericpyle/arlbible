<div class="chapterlabel"> 16</div><div class="p">
 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C16V1">&nbsp;</a>And Judith began to sing this thanksgiving in all Israel, and all the people sang with loud voices this
song of praise.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C16V2">&nbsp;</a>And Judith said,
</div>
<div class="q1">Begin to my God with timbrels,
</div>
<div class="q1">Sing to my Lord with cymbals:
</div>
<div class="q1">Tune to him psalm and praise:
</div>
<div class="q1">Exalt him, and call upon his name.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C16V3">&nbsp;</a>For the Lord is the God that breaks the battles:
</div>
<div class="q1">For in his armies in the midst of the people
</div>
<div class="q1">He delivered me out of the hand of them that persecuted me.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C16V4">&nbsp;</a>Asshur came out of the mountains from the north,
</div>
<div class="q1">He came with ten thousands of his host,
</div>
<div class="q1">The multitude whereof stopped the torrents,
</div>
<div class="q1">And their horsemen covered the hills.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C16V5">&nbsp;</a>He said that he would burn up my borders,
</div>
<div class="q1">And kill my young men with the sword,
</div>
<div class="q1">And throw my sucking children to the ground,
</div>
<div class="q1">And give mine infants for a prey,
</div>
<div class="q1">And make my virgins a spoil.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C16V6">&nbsp;</a>The Almighty Lord brought them to nothing by the hand of a woman.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C16V7">&nbsp;</a>For their mighty one did not fall by young men,
</div>
<div class="q1">Neither did sons of the Titans strike him.
</div>
<div class="q1">Nor did high giants set upon him:
</div>
<div class="q1">But Judith the daughter of Merari made him weak with the beauty of her countenance.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C16V8">&nbsp;</a>For she put off the apparel of her widowhood
</div>
<div class="q1">For the exaltation of those that were distressed in Israel,
</div>
<div class="q1">She anointed her face with ointment,
</div>
<div class="q1">And bound her hair in a tire,
</div>
<div class="q1">And took a linen garment to deceive him.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C16V9">&nbsp;</a>Her sandal ravished his eye,
</div>
<div class="q1">And her beauty took his soul prisoner:
</div>
<div class="q1">The scimitar passed through his neck.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C16V10">&nbsp;</a>The Persians quaked at her daring,
</div>
<div class="q1">And the Medes were daunted at her boldness.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C16V11">&nbsp;</a>Then my lowly ones shouted aloud,
</div>
<div class="q1">And my weak ones were terrified and crouched for fear:
</div>
<div class="q1">They lifted up their voice, and they were turned to flight.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C16V12">&nbsp;</a>The sons of damsels pierced them through,
</div>
<div class="q1">And wounded them as runagates’ children;
</div>
<div class="q1">They perished by the battle of my Lord.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C16V13">&nbsp;</a>I will sing to my God a new song:
</div>
<div class="q1">O Lord, you are great and glorious,
</div>
<div class="q1">Marvelous in strength, invincible.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C16V14">&nbsp;</a>Let all your creation serve you:
</div>
<div class="q1">For you spoke, and they were made,
</div>
<div class="q1">You did send forth your spirit, and it builded them,
</div>
<div class="q1">And there is none that shall resist your voice.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C16V15">&nbsp;</a>For the mountains shall be moved from their foundations with the waters,
</div>
<div class="q1">And the rocks shall melt as wax at your presence:
</div>
<div class="q1">But you are yet merciful to them that fear you.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C16V16">&nbsp;</a>For all sacrifice is little for a sweet savor,
</div>
<div class="q1">And all the fat is very little for a whole burnt offering to you:
</div>
<div class="q1">But he that fears the Lord is great continually.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C16V17">&nbsp;</a>Woe to the nations that rise up against my race:
</div>
<div class="q1">The Lord Almighty will take vengeance of them in the day of judgement,
</div>
<div class="q1">To put fire and worms in their flesh;
</div>
<div class="q1">And they shall weep and feel their pain for ever.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C16V18">&nbsp;</a>Now when they came to Jerusalem, they worshipped God; and when the people were purified, they offered
their whole burnt offerings, and their free will offerings, and their gifts.
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C16V19">&nbsp;</a>And Judith dedicated all the stuff of Holofernes, which the people had given her, and gave the canopy,
which she had taken for herself out of his bedchamber, for a gift to the Lord.
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C16V20">&nbsp;</a>And the people continued feasting in Jerusalem before the sanctuary for the space of three months, and
Judith remained with them.
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C16V21">&nbsp;</a>But after these days every one departed to his own inheritance, and Judith went away to Bethulia, and
remained in her own possession, and was honorable in her time in all the land.
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C16V22">&nbsp;</a>And many desired her, and no man knew her all the days of her life, from the day that Manasses her husband
died and was gathered to his people.
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C16V23">&nbsp;</a>And she increased in greatness exceedingly; and she waxed old in her husband’s house, to a hundred and
five years, and let her maid go free: and she died in Bethulia; and they buried her in the cave of her
husband Manasses.
 <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C16V24">&nbsp;</a>And the house of Israel mourned for her seven days: and she distributed her goods before she died to
all them that were nearest of kin to Manasses her husband, and to them that were nearest of her own kindred.
 <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C16V25">&nbsp;</a>And there was none that made the children of Israel any more afraid in the days of Judith, nor a long
time after her death.
