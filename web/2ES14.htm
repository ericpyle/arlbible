 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C14V1">&nbsp;</a>And it came to pass upon the third day, I sat under an oak, and, behold, there came a voice out of a
bush over against me, and said, Esdras, Esdras.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C14V2">&nbsp;</a>And I said, Here am I, Lord. And I stood up upon my feet.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C14V3">&nbsp;</a>Then said he to me, In the bush I did manifestly reveal myself, and talked with Moses, when my people
were in bondage in Egypt:

 he led my people out of Egypt; and I brought him up to the mount of Sinai, where I held him by me for
many days;
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C14V5">&nbsp;</a>and told him many wondrous things, and showed him the secrets of the times, and the end of the seasons;
and commanded him, saying,
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C14V6">&nbsp;</a>These words shall you publish openly, and these shall you hide.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C14V7">&nbsp;</a>And now I say to you,
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C14V8">&nbsp;</a>Lay up in your heart the signs that I have showed, and the dreams that you have seen, and the interpretations
which you have heard:
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C14V9">&nbsp;</a>for you shall be taken away from men, and from henceforth you shall remain with my Son, and with such
as be like you, until the times be ended.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C14V10">&nbsp;</a>For the world has lost its youth, and the times begin to wax old.

I will speak.
</span></a>
 I will speak before you, O Lord.
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C14V20">&nbsp;</a>Behold, I will go, as you have commanded me, and reprove the people that now be: but they that shall
be born afterward, who shall admonish them? for the world is set in darkness, and they that dwell therein
are without light.
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C14V21">&nbsp;</a>For your law is burned, therefore no man knows the things that are done of you, or the works that shall
be done.
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C14V22">&nbsp;</a>But if I have found favor before you, send the Holy Spirit to me, and I shall write all that has been
done in the world since the beginning, even the things that were written in your law, that men may be
able to find the path, and that they which would live in the latter days may live.
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C14V23">&nbsp;</a>And he answered me and said, Go your way, gather the people together, and say to them, that they seek
you not for forty days.
 <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C14V24">&nbsp;</a>But look you prepare you many tablets, and take with you Sarea, Dabria, Selemia, Ethanus, and Asiel,
these five, which are ready to write swiftly;
 <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C14V25">&nbsp;</a>and come here, and I shall light a lamp of understanding in your heart, which shall not be put out, till
the things be ended which you shall write.
 <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C14V26">&nbsp;</a>And when you have done, some things shall you publish openly, and some things shall you deliver in secret
to the wise: tomorrow this hour shall you begin to write.

<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C14V27">&nbsp;</a>Then went I forth, as he commanded me, and gathered all the people together, and said,
 <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C14V28">&nbsp;</a>Hear these words, O Israel.
 <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C14V29">&nbsp;</a>Our fathers at the beginning were strangers in Egypt, and they were delivered from thence,
 <span class="verse"> 30</span><a name="C14V30">&nbsp;</a>and received the law of life, which they kept not, which you⌃ also have transgressed after them.

 the land, even the land of Sion, given you for a possession: but you⌃ yourselves, and your fathers,
have done unrighteousness, and have not kept the ways which the Most High commanded you.
 <span class="verse"> 32</span><a name="C14V32">&nbsp;</a>And forasmuch as he is a righteous judge, he took from you for a while the thing that he had given you.
 <span class="verse"> 33</span><a name="C14V33">&nbsp;</a>And now you⌃ are here, and your brethren are among you.
 <span class="verse"> 34</span><a name="C14V34">&nbsp;</a>Therefore if so be that you⌃ will rule over your own understanding, and instruct your hearts, you⌃ shall
be kept alive, and after death you⌃ shall obtain mercy.
 <span class="verse"> 35</span><a name="C14V35">&nbsp;</a>For after death shall the judgement come, when we shall live again: and then shall the names of the righteous
be manifest, and the works of the ungodly shall be declared.
 <span class="verse"> 36</span><a name="C14V36">&nbsp;</a>Let no man therefore come to me now, nor seek after me these forty days.
 <span class="verse"> 37</span><a name="C14V37">&nbsp;</a>So I took the five men, as he commanded me, and we went forth into the field, and remained there.
 <span class="verse"> 38</span><a name="C14V38">&nbsp;</a>And it came to pass on the morrow that, behold, a voice called me, saying, Esdras, open your mouth, and
drink that I give you to drink.
 <span class="verse"> 39</span><a name="C14V39">&nbsp;</a>Then opened I my mouth, and, behold, there was reached to me a full cup, which was full as it were with
water, but the color of it was like fire.
 <span class="verse"> 40</span><a name="C14V40">&nbsp;</a>And I took it, and drank: and when I had drunk of it, my heart uttered understanding, and wisdom grew
in my breast, for my spirit retained its memory:
 <span class="verse"> 41</span><a name="C14V41">&nbsp;</a>and my mouth was opened, and shut no more.
 <span class="verse"> 42</span><a name="C14V42">&nbsp;</a>The Most High gave understanding to the five men, and they wrote by course the things that were told

 characters which they knew not, and they sat forty days: now they wrote in the day-time, and at night
they ate bread.
 <span class="verse"> 43</span><a name="C14V43">&nbsp;</a>As for me, I spoke in the day, and by night I held not my tongue.
 <span class="verse"> 44</span><a name="C14V44">&nbsp;</a>So in forty days were written

</span></a>
 fourscore and fourteen books.
 <span class="verse"> 45</span><a name="C14V45">&nbsp;</a>And it came to pass, when the forty days were fulfilled, that the Most High spoke to me, saying, The
first that you have written publish openly, and let the worthy and unworthy read it:
 <span class="verse"> 46</span><a name="C14V46">&nbsp;</a>but keep the seventy last, that you may deliver them to such as be wise among your people:
 <span class="verse"> 47</span><a name="C14V47">&nbsp;</a>for in them is the spring of understanding, the fountain of wisdom, and the stream of knowledge.
 <span class="verse"> 48</span><a name="C14V48">&nbsp;</a>And I did so.
