 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C15V1">&nbsp;</a>Then Pharisees and scribes came to Jesus from Jerusalem, saying,
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C15V2">&nbsp;</a>“Why do your disciples disobey the tradition of the elders? For they don’t wash their hands when they
eat bread.”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C15V3">&nbsp;</a>He answered them,
<span class="wj">“Why do you also disobey the commandment of God because of your tradition?
</span> <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C15V4">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">For God commanded, ‘Honor your father and your mother,’</span><a href="#FN1"><span class="notemark"></span><span class="popup">+ Exodus 20:12; Deuteronomy 5:16</span></a>
<span class="wj">and, ‘He who speaks evil of father or mother, let him be put to death.’</span><a href="#FN2"><span class="notemark"></span><span class="popup">+ Exodus 21:17; Leviticus 20:9</span></a>
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C15V5">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">But you say, ‘Whoever may tell his father or his mother, “Whatever help you might otherwise have gotten
from me is a gift devoted to God,”
</span> <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C15V6">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">he shall not honor his father or mother.’ You have made the commandment of God void because of your tradition.
</span> <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C15V7">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">You hypocrites! Well did Isaiah prophesy of you, saying,</span></div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C15V8">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">‘These people draw near to me with their mouth,</span></div>
<div class="q2"><span class="wj">and honor me with their lips;</span></div>
<div class="q2"><span class="wj">but their heart is far from me.</span></div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C15V9">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">And in vain do they worship me,</span></div>
<div class="q2"><span class="wj">teaching as doctrine rules made by men.’”</span><a href="#FN3"><span class="notemark"></span><span class="popup">+ Isaiah 29:13
</span></a>
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C15V10">&nbsp;</a>He summoned the multitude, and said to them,
<span class="wj">“Hear, and understand.
</span> <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C15V11">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">That which enters into the mouth doesn’t defile the man; but that which proceeds out of the mouth, this
defiles the man.”</span></div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C15V12">&nbsp;</a>Then the disciples came, and said to him, “Do you know that the Pharisees were offended, when they heard
this saying?”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C15V13">&nbsp;</a>But he answered,
<span class="wj">“Every plant which my heavenly Father didn’t plant will be uprooted.
</span> <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C15V14">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Leave them alone. They are blind guides of the blind. If the blind guide the blind, both will fall into
a pit.”</span></div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C15V15">&nbsp;</a>Peter answered him, “Explain the parable to us.”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C15V16">&nbsp;</a>So Jesus said,
<span class="wj">“Do you also still not understand?
</span> <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C15V17">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Don’t you understand that whatever goes into the mouth passes into the belly, and then out of the body?
</span> <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C15V18">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">But the things which proceed out of the mouth come out of the heart, and they defile the man.
</span> <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C15V19">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">For out of the heart come evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, sexual sins, thefts, false testimony, and
blasphemies.
</span> <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C15V20">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">These are the things which defile the man; but to eat with unwashed hands doesn’t defile the man.”</span></div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C15V21">&nbsp;</a>Jesus went out from there, and withdrew into the region of Tyre and Sidon.
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C15V22">&nbsp;</a>Behold, a Canaanite woman came out from those borders, and cried, saying, “Have mercy on me, Lord, you
son of David! My daughter is severely possessed by a demon!”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C15V23">&nbsp;</a>But he answered her not a word.
</div>
<div class="p">His disciples came and begged him, saying, “Send her away; for she cries after us.”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C15V24">&nbsp;</a>But he answered,
<span class="wj">“I wasn’t sent to anyone but the lost sheep of the house of Israel.”</span></div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C15V25">&nbsp;</a>But she came and worshiped him, saying, “Lord, help me.”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C15V26">&nbsp;</a>But he answered,
<span class="wj">“It is not appropriate to take the children’s bread and throw it to the dogs.”</span></div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C15V27">&nbsp;</a>But she said, “Yes, Lord, but even the dogs eat the crumbs which fall from their masters’ table.”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C15V28">&nbsp;</a>Then Jesus answered her,
<span class="wj">“Woman, great is your faith! Be it done to you even as you desire.”</span> And her daughter was healed from that hour.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C15V29">&nbsp;</a>Jesus departed there, and came near to the sea of Galilee; and he went up into the mountain, and sat
there.
 <span class="verse"> 30</span><a name="C15V30">&nbsp;</a>Great multitudes came to him, having with them the lame, blind, mute, maimed, and many others, and they
put them down at his feet. He healed them,
 <span class="verse"> 31</span><a name="C15V31">&nbsp;</a>so that the multitude wondered when they saw the mute speaking, the injured healed, the lame walking,
and the blind seeing—and they glorified the God of Israel.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 32</span><a name="C15V32">&nbsp;</a>Jesus summoned his disciples and said,
<span class="wj">“I have compassion on the multitude, because they continue with me now three days and have nothing to
eat. I don’t want to send them away fasting, or they might faint on the way.”
</span></div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 33</span><a name="C15V33">&nbsp;</a>The disciples said to him, “Where should we get so many loaves in a deserted place as to satisfy so great
a multitude?”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 34</span><a name="C15V34">&nbsp;</a>Jesus said to them,
<span class="wj">“How many loaves do you have?”</span></div>
<div class="p">They said, “Seven, and a few small fish.”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 35</span><a name="C15V35">&nbsp;</a>He commanded the multitude to sit down on the ground;
 <span class="verse"> 36</span><a name="C15V36">&nbsp;</a>and he took the seven loaves and the fish. He gave thanks and broke them, and gave to the disciples,
and the disciples to the multitudes.
 <span class="verse"> 37</span><a name="C15V37">&nbsp;</a>They all ate, and were filled. They took up seven baskets full of the broken pieces that were left over.
 <span class="verse"> 38</span><a name="C15V38">&nbsp;</a>Those who ate were four thousand men, besides women and children.
 <span class="verse"> 39</span><a name="C15V39">&nbsp;</a>Then he sent away the multitudes, got into the boat, and came into the borders of Magdala.
