which I give to you,

as a freewill offering, or in your set feasts, to make a pleasant aroma to Yahweh, of the herd, or of
the flock;

throughout your generations;
 <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C15V24">&nbsp;</a>then it shall be, if it was done unwittingly, without the knowledge of the congregation, that all the
congregation shall offer one young bull for a burnt offering, for a pleasant aroma to Yahweh, with its
meal offering, and its drink offering, according to the ordinance, and one male goat for a sin offering.
 <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C15V25">&nbsp;</a>The priest shall make atonement for all the congregation of the children of Israel, and they shall be
forgiven; for it was an error, and they have brought their offering, an offering made by fire to Yahweh,
and their sin offering before Yahweh, for their error.
 <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C15V26">&nbsp;</a>All the congregation of the children of Israel shall be forgiven, as well as the stranger who lives as
a foreigner among them; for with regard to all the people, it was done unwittingly.

atonement for him; and he shall be forgiven.

blasphemes Yahweh. That soul shall be cut off from among his people.
 <span class="verse"> 31</span><a name="C15V31">&nbsp;</a>Because he has despised Yahweh’s word, and has broken his commandment, that soul shall utterly be cut
off. His iniquity shall be on him.’”

<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 32</span><a name="C15V32">&nbsp;</a>While the children of Israel were in the wilderness, they found a man gathering sticks on the Sabbath
day.
 <span class="verse"> 33</span><a name="C15V33">&nbsp;</a>Those who found him gathering sticks brought him to Moses and Aaron, and to all the congregation.
 <span class="verse"> 34</span><a name="C15V34">&nbsp;</a>They put him in custody, because it had not been declared what should be done to him.

<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 35</span><a name="C15V35">&nbsp;</a>Yahweh said to Moses, “The man shall surely be put to death. All the congregation shall stone him with
stones outside of the camp.”

commanded Moses.

 in the borders of their garments throughout their generations, and that they put on the fringe
<a href="#FN5"><span class="notemark">**</span><span class="popup">or, tassel</span></a>
 of each border a cord of blue:

 that you may look on it, and remember all Yahweh’s commandments, and do them; and that you not follow
after your own heart and your own eyes, after which you use to play the prostitute;
 <span class="verse"> 40</span><a name="C15V40">&nbsp;</a>that you may remember and do all my commandments, and be holy to your God.
