 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C13V1">&nbsp;</a>When Ephraim spoke, there was trembling.
</div>
<div class="q2">He exalted himself in Israel,
</div>
<div class="q2">but when he became guilty in Baal, he died.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C13V2">&nbsp;</a>Now they sin more and more,
</div>
<div class="q2">and have made themselves molten images of their silver,
</div>
<div class="q2">even idols according to their own understanding,
</div>
<div class="q2">all of them the work of the craftsmen.
</div>
<div class="q2">They say of them, ‘They offer human sacrifice and kiss the calves.’
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C13V3">&nbsp;</a>Therefore they will be like the morning mist,
</div>
<div class="q2">and like the dew that passes away early,
</div>
<div class="q2">like the chaff that is driven with the whirlwind out of the threshing floor,
</div>
<div class="q2">and like the smoke out of the chimney.

</div>
<div class="q2">and you shall acknowledge no god but me,
</div>
<div class="q2">and besides me there is no savior.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C13V5">&nbsp;</a>I knew you in the wilderness,
</div>
<div class="q2">in the land of great drought.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C13V6">&nbsp;</a>According to their pasture, so were they filled;
</div>
<div class="q2">they were filled, and their heart was exalted.
</div>
<div class="q2">Therefore they have forgotten me.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C13V7">&nbsp;</a>Therefore I am like a lion to them.
</div>
<div class="q2">Like a leopard, I will lurk by the path.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C13V8">&nbsp;</a>I will meet them like a bear that is bereaved of her cubs,
</div>
<div class="q2">and will tear the covering of their heart.
</div>
<div class="q2">There I will devour them like a lioness.
</div>
<div class="q2">The wild animal will tear them.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C13V9">&nbsp;</a>You are destroyed, Israel, because you are against me,
</div>
<div class="q2">against your help.

<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C13V10">&nbsp;</a>Where is your king now, that he may save you in all your cities?
</div>
<div class="q2">And your judges, of whom you said, ‘Give me a king and princes?’
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C13V11">&nbsp;</a>I have given you a king in my anger,

<div class="q2">the breath of Yahweh coming up from the wilderness;
</div>
<div class="q2">and his spring will become dry,
</div>
<div class="q2">and his fountain will be dried up.
</div>
<div class="q2">He will plunder the storehouse of treasure.

<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C13V16">&nbsp;</a>Samaria will bear her guilt;
</div>
<div class="q2">for she has rebelled against her God.
