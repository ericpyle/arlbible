 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C4V1">&nbsp;</a>Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C4V2">&nbsp;</a>“Speak to the children of Israel, saying, ‘If anyone sins unintentionally, in any of the things which
Yahweh has commanded not to be done, and does any one of them:
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C4V3">&nbsp;</a>if the anointed priest sins so as to bring guilt on the people, then let him offer for his sin, which
he has sinned, a young bull without defect to Yahweh for a sin offering.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C4V4">&nbsp;</a>He shall bring the bull to the door of the Tent of Meeting before Yahweh; and he shall lay his hand on
the head of the bull, and kill the bull before Yahweh.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C4V5">&nbsp;</a>The anointed priest shall take some of the blood of the bull, and bring it to the Tent of Meeting.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C4V6">&nbsp;</a>The priest shall dip his finger in the blood, and sprinkle some of the blood seven times before Yahweh,
before the veil of the sanctuary.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C4V7">&nbsp;</a>The priest shall put some of the blood on the horns of the altar of sweet incense before Yahweh, which
is in the Tent of Meeting; and he shall pour out all of rest of the blood of the bull at the base of
the altar of burnt offering, which is at the door of the Tent of Meeting.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C4V8">&nbsp;</a>He shall take all the fat of the bull of the sin offering off of it; the fat that covers the innards,
and all the fat that is on the innards,
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C4V9">&nbsp;</a>and the two kidneys, and the fat that is on them, which is by the loins, and the cover on the liver,
with the kidneys, he shall take away,
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C4V10">&nbsp;</a>as it is taken off of the bull of the sacrifice of peace offerings. The priest shall burn them on the
altar of burnt offering.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C4V11">&nbsp;</a>The bull’s skin, all its meat, with its head, and with its legs, its innards, and its dung,
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C4V12">&nbsp;</a>he shall carry the whole bull outside of the camp to a clean place, where the ashes are poured out, and
burn it on wood with fire. Where the ashes are poured out, it shall be burned.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C4V13">&nbsp;</a>“‘If the whole congregation of Israel sins, and the thing is hidden from the eyes of the assembly, and
they have done any of the things which Yahweh has commanded not to be done, and are guilty;
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C4V14">&nbsp;</a>when the sin in which they have sinned is known, then the assembly shall offer a young bull for a sin
offering, and bring it before the Tent of Meeting.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C4V15">&nbsp;</a>The elders of the congregation shall lay their hands on the head of the bull before Yahweh; and the bull
shall be killed before Yahweh.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C4V16">&nbsp;</a>The anointed priest shall bring of the blood of the bull to the Tent of Meeting:
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C4V17">&nbsp;</a>and the priest shall dip his finger in the blood, and sprinkle it seven times before Yahweh, before the
veil.
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C4V18">&nbsp;</a>He shall put some of the blood on the horns of the altar which is before Yahweh, that is in the Tent
of Meeting; and the rest of the blood he shall pour out at the base of the altar of burnt offering, which
is at the door of the Tent of Meeting.
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C4V19">&nbsp;</a>All its fat he shall take from it, and burn it on the altar.
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C4V20">&nbsp;</a>Thus shall he do with the bull; as he did with the bull of the sin offering, so shall he do with this;
and the priest shall make atonement for them, and they shall be forgiven.
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C4V21">&nbsp;</a>He shall carry the bull outside the camp, and burn it as he burned the first bull. It is the sin offering
for the assembly.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C4V22">&nbsp;</a>“‘When a ruler sins, and unwittingly does any one of all the things which Yahweh his God has commanded
not to be done, and is guilty;
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C4V23">&nbsp;</a>if his sin, in which he has sinned, is made known to him, he shall bring as his offering a goat, a male
without defect.
 <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C4V24">&nbsp;</a>He shall lay his hand on the head of the goat, and kill it in the place where they kill the burnt offering
before Yahweh. It is a sin offering.
 <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C4V25">&nbsp;</a>The priest shall take some of the blood of the sin offering with his finger, and put it on the horns
of the altar of burnt offering. He shall pour out the rest of its blood at the base of the altar of burnt
offering.
 <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C4V26">&nbsp;</a>All its fat he shall burn on the altar, like the fat of the sacrifice of peace offerings; and the priest
shall make atonement for him concerning his sin, and he will be forgiven.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C4V27">&nbsp;</a>“‘If anyone of the common people sins unwittingly, in doing any of the things which Yahweh has commanded
not to be done, and is guilty;
 <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C4V28">&nbsp;</a>if his sin, which he has sinned, is made known to him, then he shall bring for his offering a goat, a
female without defect, for his sin which he has sinned.
 <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C4V29">&nbsp;</a>He shall lay his hand on the head of the sin offering, and kill the sin offering in the place of burnt
offering.
 <span class="verse"> 30</span><a name="C4V30">&nbsp;</a>The priest shall take some of its blood with his finger, and put it on the horns of the altar of burnt
offering; and the rest of its blood he shall pour out at the base of the altar.
 <span class="verse"> 31</span><a name="C4V31">&nbsp;</a>All its fat he shall take away, like the fat is taken away from off of the sacrifice of peace offerings;
and the priest shall burn it on the altar for a pleasant aroma to Yahweh; and the priest shall make atonement
for him, and he will be forgiven.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 32</span><a name="C4V32">&nbsp;</a>“‘If he brings a lamb as his offering for a sin offering, he shall bring a female without defect.
 <span class="verse"> 33</span><a name="C4V33">&nbsp;</a>He shall lay his hand on the head of the sin offering, and kill it for a sin offering in the place where
they kill the burnt offering.
 <span class="verse"> 34</span><a name="C4V34">&nbsp;</a>The priest shall take some of the blood of the sin offering with his finger, and put it on the horns
of the altar of burnt offering; and all the rest of its blood he shall pour out at the base of the altar.
 <span class="verse"> 35</span><a name="C4V35">&nbsp;</a>All its fat he shall take away, like the fat of the lamb is taken away from the sacrifice of peace offerings;
and the priest shall burn them on the altar, on the offerings of Yahweh made by fire; and the priest
shall make atonement for him concerning his sin that he has sinned, and he will be forgiven.
