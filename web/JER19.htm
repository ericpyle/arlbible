<div class="chapterlabel"> 19</div><div class="p">
 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C19V1">&nbsp;</a>Thus said Yahweh, “Go, and buy a potter’s earthen bottle, and take some of the elders of the people,
and of the elders of the priests;
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C19V2">&nbsp;</a>and go out to the valley of the son of Hinnom, which is by the entry of the gate Harsith, and proclaim
there the words that I will tell you.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C19V3">&nbsp;</a>Say, ‘Hear Yahweh’s word, kings of Judah, and inhabitants of Jerusalem: Yahweh of Armies, the God of
Israel says, “Behold, I will bring evil on this place, which whoever hears, his ears will tingle.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C19V4">&nbsp;</a>Because they have forsaken me, and have defiled this place, and have burned incense in it to other gods,
that they didn’t know, they and their fathers and the kings of Judah; and have filled this place with
the blood of innocents,
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C19V5">&nbsp;</a>and have built the high places of Baal, to burn their sons in the fire for burnt offerings to Baal; which
I didn’t command, nor speak, which didn’t even enter into my mind:
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C19V6">&nbsp;</a>therefore, behold, the days come,” says Yahweh, “that this place will no more be called ‘Topheth’, nor
‘The Valley of the son of Hinnom’, but ‘The valley of Slaughter’.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C19V7">&nbsp;</a>“‘“I will make the counsel of Judah and Jerusalem void in this place. I will cause them to fall by the
sword before their enemies, and by the hand of those who seek their life. I will give their dead bodies
to be food for the birds of the sky and for the animals of the earth.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C19V8">&nbsp;</a>I will make this city an astonishment and a hissing. Everyone who passes by it will be astonished and
hiss because of all its plagues.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C19V9">&nbsp;</a>I will cause them to eat the flesh of their sons and the flesh of their daughters. They will each eat
the flesh of his friend in the siege and in the distress, with which their enemies, and those who seek
their life, will distress them.”’
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C19V10">&nbsp;</a>“Then you shall break the bottle in the sight of the men who go with you,
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C19V11">&nbsp;</a>and shall tell them, ‘Yahweh of Armies says: “Even so I will break this people and this city, as one
breaks a potter’s vessel, that can’t be made whole again. They will bury in Topheth, until there is no
place to bury.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C19V12">&nbsp;</a>Thus will I do to this place,” says Yahweh, “and to its inhabitants, even making this city as Topheth.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C19V13">&nbsp;</a>The houses of Jerusalem, and the houses of the kings of Judah, which are defiled, will be as the place
of Topheth, even all the houses on whose roofs they have burned incense to all the army of the sky, and
have poured out drink offerings to other gods.”’”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C19V14">&nbsp;</a>Then Jeremiah came from Topheth, where Yahweh had sent him to prophesy; and he stood in the court of
Yahweh’s house, and said to all the people:
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C19V15">&nbsp;</a>“Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel says, ‘Behold, I will bring on this city and on all its towns all
the evil that I have pronounced against it, because they have made their neck stiff, that they may not
hear my words.’”
