 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C9V1">&nbsp;</a>But Judith fell upon her face, and put ashes upon her head, and uncovered the sackcloth wherewith she
was clothed; and the incense of that evening was now being offered at Jerusalem in the house of God,
and Judith cried to the Lord with a loud voice, and said,

<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C9V2">&nbsp;</a>O Lord God of my father Simeon, into whose hand you gave a sword to take vengeance of the strangers,
who loosened the girdle of a virgin to defile her, and uncovered the thigh to her shame, and profaned
the womb to her reproach; for you said, It shall not be so; and they did so:
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C9V3">&nbsp;</a>wherefore you gave their rulers to be slain, and their bed,
<a href="#FN1"><span class="notemark">*</span><span class="popup">Some authorities read
which was ashamed for their deceit that they wrought.
</span></a>
 which was ashamed for her that was deceived, to be dyed in blood, and struck the servants with their
lords, and the lords upon their thrones;
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C9V4">&nbsp;</a>and gave their wives for a prey, and their daughters to be captives, and all their spoils to be divided
among your dear children; which were moved with zeal for you, and abhorred the pollution of their blood,
and called upon you for aid: O God, O my God, hear me also that am a widow.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C9V5">&nbsp;</a>For you wrought the things that were before those things, and those things, and such as ensued after;
and you did devise the things which are now, and the things which are to come: and the things which you
did devise came to pass;
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C9V6">&nbsp;</a>yes, the things which you did determine stood before you, and said, Behold, we are here: for all your
ways are prepared, and your judgement is with foreknowledge.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C9V7">&nbsp;</a>For, behold, the Assyrians are multiplied in their power; they are exalted with horse and rider; they
have gloried in the

</span></a>
 strength of their footmen; they have trusted in shield and spear and bow and sling; and they know not
that you are the Lord that breaks the battles: the Lord is your name.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C9V8">&nbsp;</a>Dash you down their strength in your power, and bring down their force in your wrath: for they have purposed
to profane your sanctuary, and to defile the tabernacle where your glorious name rests, and to cast down
with the sword the horn of your altar.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C9V9">&nbsp;</a>Look upon their pride, and send your wrath upon their heads: give into my hand, which am a widow, the
might that I have conceived.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C9V10">&nbsp;</a>Strike by the deceit of my lips the servant with the prince, and the prince with his servant: break down
their stateliness by the hand of a woman.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C9V11">&nbsp;</a>For your power stands not in multitude, nor your might in strong men: but you are a God of the afflicted,
you are a helper of the

 oppressed, an upholder of the weak, a protector of the forlorn, a savior of them that are without hope.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C9V12">&nbsp;</a>Yes, yes, God of my father, and God of the inheritance of Israel, Lord of the heavens and of the earth.
Creator of the waters, King

</span></a>
 of every creature, hear you my prayer:
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C9V13">&nbsp;</a>and make my speech and deceit to be their wound and stripe, who have purposed hard things against your
covenant, and your hallowed house, and the top of Sion, and the house of the possession of your children.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C9V14">&nbsp;</a>And make every nation and tribe of your to know that you are God, the God of all power and might, and
that there is none other that protects the race of Israel but you.
