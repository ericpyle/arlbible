six working days; but on the Sabbath day it shall be opened, and on the day of the new moon it shall
be opened.

gate; and the priests shall prepare his burnt offering and his peace offerings, and he shall worship
at the threshold of the gate: then he shall go out; but the gate shall not be shut until the evening.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C46V3">&nbsp;</a>The people of the land shall worship at the door of that gate before Yahweh on the Sabbaths and on the
new moons.

according as he is able, and a hin of oil to an ephah.

of the south gate shall go out by the way of the north gate. He shall not return by the way of the gate
by which he came in, but shall go out straight before him.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C46V10">&nbsp;</a>The prince shall go in with them when they go in; and when they go out, he shall go out.

going out one shall shut the gate.

shall belong to his sons; it is their possession by inheritance.

then it shall return to the prince; but as for his inheritance, it shall be for his sons.

He shall give inheritance to his sons out of his own possession, that my people not each be scattered
from his possession.”’”

<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C46V19">&nbsp;</a>Then he brought me through the entry, which was at the side of the gate, into the holy rooms for the
priests, which looked toward the north: and behold, there was a place on the hinder part westward.
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C46V20">&nbsp;</a>He said to me, “This is the place where the priests shall boil the trespass offering and the sin offering,
and where they shall bake the meal offering; that they not bring them out into the outer court, to sanctify
the people.”

and behold, in every corner of the court there was a court.
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C46V22">&nbsp;</a>In the four corners of the court there were courts enclosed, forty cubits<a href="#FN4"><span class="notemark">§</span><span class="popup">A cubit is the length from the tip of the middle finger to the elbow on a man’s arm, or about 18 inches

 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C46V23">&nbsp;</a>There was a wall around in them, around the four, and boiling places were made under the walls all around.
