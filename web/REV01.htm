 to his servant, John,
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C1V2">&nbsp;</a>who testified to God’s word, and of the testimony of Jesus Christ, about everything that he saw.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C1V3">&nbsp;</a>Blessed is he who reads and those who hear the words of the prophecy, and keep the things that are written
in it, for the time is at hand.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C1V4">&nbsp;</a>John, to the seven assemblies that are in Asia: Grace to you and peace, from God, who is and who was
and who is to come; and from the seven Spirits who are before his throne;
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C1V5">&nbsp;</a>and from Jesus Christ, the faithful witness, the firstborn of the dead, and the ruler of the kings of

was on the isle that is called Patmos because of God’s Word and the testimony of Jesus Christ.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C1V10">&nbsp;</a>I was in the Spirit on the Lord’s day, and I heard behind me a loud voice, like a trumpet

 clothed with a robe reaching down to his feet, and with a golden sash around his chest.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C1V14">&nbsp;</a>His head and his hair were white as white wool, like snow. His eyes were like a flame of fire.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C1V15">&nbsp;</a>His feet were like burnished brass, as if it had been refined in a furnace. His voice was like the voice
of many waters.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C1V16">&nbsp;</a>He had seven stars in his right hand. Out of his mouth proceeded a sharp two-edged sword. His face was
like the sun shining at its brightest.
