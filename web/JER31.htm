 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C31V1">&nbsp;</a>“At that time,” says Yahweh, “I will be the God of all the families of Israel, and they will be my people.”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C31V2">&nbsp;</a>Yahweh says, “The people who survive the sword found favor in the wilderness; even Israel, when I went
to cause him to rest.”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C31V3">&nbsp;</a>Yahweh appeared of old to me, saying,
</div>
<div class="q1">“Yes, I have loved you with an everlasting love.
</div>
<div class="q2">Therefore I have drawn you with loving kindness.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C31V4">&nbsp;</a>I will build you again,
</div>
<div class="q2">and you will be built, O virgin of Israel.
</div>
<div class="q1">You will again be adorned with your tambourines,
</div>
<div class="q2">and will go out in the dances of those who make merry.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C31V5">&nbsp;</a>Again you will plant vineyards on the mountains of Samaria.
</div>
<div class="q2">The planters will plant,
</div>
<div class="q2">and will enjoy its fruit.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C31V6">&nbsp;</a>For there will be a day that the watchmen on the hills of Ephraim cry,
</div>
<div class="q2">‘Arise, and let us go up to Zion to Yahweh our God.’”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C31V7">&nbsp;</a>For Yahweh says,
</div>
<div class="q1">“Sing with gladness for Jacob,
</div>
<div class="q2">and shout for the chief of the nations.
</div>
<div class="q1">Publish, praise, and say,
</div>
<div class="q2">‘Yahweh, save your people,
</div>
<div class="q2">the remnant of Israel!’
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C31V8">&nbsp;</a>Behold, I will bring them from the north country,
</div>
<div class="q2">and gather them from the uttermost parts of the earth,
</div>
<div class="q1">along with the blind and the lame,
</div>
<div class="q2">the woman with child and her who travails with child together.
</div>
<div class="q2">They will return as a great company.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C31V9">&nbsp;</a>They will come with weeping.
</div>
<div class="q2">I will lead them with petitions.
</div>
<div class="q1">I will cause them to walk by rivers of waters,
</div>
<div class="q2">in a straight way in which they won’t stumble;
</div>
<div class="q1">for I am a father to Israel.
</div>
<div class="q2">Ephraim is my firstborn.
</div>
<div class="b"></div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C31V10">&nbsp;</a>“Hear Yahweh’s word, you nations,

</div>
<div class="q2">and keep him, as a shepherd does his flock.’
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C31V11">&nbsp;</a>For Yahweh has ransomed Jacob,

<div class="q2">and redeemed him from the hand of him who was stronger than he.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C31V12">&nbsp;</a>They will come and sing in the height of Zion,
</div>
<div class="q2">and will flow to the goodness of Yahweh,
</div>
<div class="q1">to the grain, to the new wine, to the oil,
</div>
<div class="q2">and to the young of the flock and of the herd.
</div>
<div class="q1">Their soul will be as a watered garden.
</div>
<div class="q2">They will not sorrow any more at all.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C31V13">&nbsp;</a>Then the virgin will rejoice in the dance;
</div>
<div class="q2">the young men and the old together;

</div>
<div class="q2">and will comfort them, and make them rejoice from their sorrow.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C31V14">&nbsp;</a>I will satiate the soul of the priests with fatness,
</div>
<div class="q2">and my people will be satisfied with my goodness,” says Yahweh.
</div>
<div class="b"></div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C31V15">&nbsp;</a>Yahweh says:
</div>
<div class="q1">“A voice is heard in Ramah,
</div>
<div class="q2">lamentation and bitter weeping,
</div>
<div class="q1">Rachel weeping for her children.
</div>
<div class="q2">She refuses to be comforted for her children,
</div>
<div class="q2">because they are no more.”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C31V16">&nbsp;</a>Yahweh says:
</div>
<div class="q1">“Refrain your voice from weeping,
</div>
<div class="q2">and your eyes from tears;
</div>
<div class="q2">for your work will be rewarded,” says Yahweh.
</div>
<div class="q2">“They will come again from the land of the enemy.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C31V17">&nbsp;</a>There is hope for your latter end,” says Yahweh.
</div>
<div class="q2">“Your children will come again to their own territory.
</div>
<div class="b"></div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C31V18">&nbsp;</a>“I have surely heard Ephraim grieving thus,
</div>
<div class="q2">‘You have chastised me,
</div>
<div class="q2">and I was chastised, as an untrained calf.
</div>
<div class="q1">Turn me, and I will be turned;
</div>
<div class="q2">for you are Yahweh my God.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C31V19">&nbsp;</a>Surely after that I was turned.
</div>
<div class="q2">I repented.
</div>
<div class="q1">After that I was instructed.
</div>
<div class="q2">I struck my thigh.
</div>
<div class="q1">I was ashamed, yes, even confounded,
</div>
<div class="q2">because I bore the reproach of my youth.’
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C31V20">&nbsp;</a>Is Ephraim my dear son?
</div>
<div class="q2">Is he a darling child?
</div>
<div class="q1">For as often as I speak against him,
</div>
<div class="q2">I still earnestly remember him.
</div>
<div class="q1">therefore my heart yearns for him.
</div>
<div class="q2">I will surely have mercy on him,” says Yahweh.
</div>
<div class="b"></div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C31V21">&nbsp;</a>“Set up road signs.
</div>
<div class="q2">Make guideposts.
</div>
<div class="q1">Set your heart toward the highway,
</div>
<div class="q2">even the way by which you went.
</div>
<div class="q1">Turn again, virgin of Israel.
</div>
<div class="q2">Turn again to these your cities.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C31V22">&nbsp;</a>How long will you go here and there,
</div>
<div class="q2">you backsliding daughter?
</div>
<div class="q1">For Yahweh has created a new thing in the earth:
</div>
<div class="q2">a woman will encompass a man.”
</div>
<div class="b"></div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C31V23">&nbsp;</a>Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel, says: “Yet again they will use this speech in the land of Judah
and in its cities, when I reverse their captivity: ‘Yahweh bless you, habitation of righteousness, mountain
of holiness.’
 <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C31V24">&nbsp;</a>Judah and all its cities will dwell therein together, the farmers, and those who go about with flocks.
 <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C31V25">&nbsp;</a>For I have satiated the weary soul, and I have replenished every sorrowful soul.”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C31V26">&nbsp;</a>On this I awakened, and saw; and my sleep was sweet to me.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C31V27">&nbsp;</a>“Behold, the days come,” says Yahweh, “that I will sow the house of Israel and the house of Judah with
the seed of man and with the seed of animal.
 <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C31V28">&nbsp;</a>It will happen that, like as I have watched over them to pluck up and to break down and to overthrow
and to destroy and to afflict, so will I watch over them to build and to plant,” says Yahweh.
 <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C31V29">&nbsp;</a>“In those days they will say no more,
</div>
<div class="q1">“‘The fathers have eaten sour grapes,
</div>
<div class="q2">and the children’s teeth are set on edge.’
</div>
<div class="m"> <span class="verse"> 30</span><a name="C31V30">&nbsp;</a>But everyone will die for his own iniquity. Every man who eats the sour grapes, his teeth will be set
on edge.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 31</span><a name="C31V31">&nbsp;</a>“Behold, the days come,” says Yahweh,
</div>
<div class="q2">“that I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel,
</div>
<div class="q2">and with the house of Judah:
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 32</span><a name="C31V32">&nbsp;</a>not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day that I took them by the hand
to bring them out of the land of Egypt;
</div>
<div class="q2">which covenant of mine they broke,
</div>
<div class="q2">although I was a husband to them,” says Yahweh.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 33</span><a name="C31V33">&nbsp;</a>“But this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days,”
</div>
<div class="q2">says Yahweh:
</div>
<div class="q1">I will put my law in their inward parts,
</div>
<div class="q2">and I will write it in their heart.
</div>
<div class="q1">I will be their God,
</div>
<div class="q2">and they shall be my people.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 34</span><a name="C31V34">&nbsp;</a>They will no longer each teach his neighbor,
</div>
<div class="q2">and every man teach his brother, saying, ‘Know Yahweh;’
</div>
<div class="q1">for they will all know me,
</div>
<div class="q2">from their least to their greatest,” says Yahweh:
</div>
<div class="q1">“for I will forgive their iniquity,
</div>
<div class="q2">and I will remember their sin no more.”
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 35</span><a name="C31V35">&nbsp;</a>Yahweh, who gives the sun for a light by day,
</div>
<div class="q2">and the ordinances of the moon and of the stars for a light by night,
</div>
<div class="q1">who stirs up the sea, so that its waves roar;
</div>
<div class="q2">Yahweh of Armies is his name, says:
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 36</span><a name="C31V36">&nbsp;</a>“If these ordinances depart from before me,” says Yahweh,
</div>
<div class="q2">“then the offspring<a href="#FN1"><span class="notemark">*</span><span class="popup">or, seed</span></a>
 of Israel also will cease from being a nation before me forever.”
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 37</span><a name="C31V37">&nbsp;</a>Yahweh says: “If heaven above can be measured,
</div>
<div class="q2">and the foundations of the earth searched out beneath,
</div>
<div class="q2">then I will also cast off all the offspring<a href="#FN2"><span class="notemark">†</span><span class="popup">or, seed</span></a>
 of Israel for all that they have done,” says Yahweh.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 38</span><a name="C31V38">&nbsp;</a>“Behold, the days come,” says Yahweh, “that the city will be built to Yahweh from the tower of Hananel
to the gate of the corner.
 <span class="verse"> 39</span><a name="C31V39">&nbsp;</a>The measuring line will go out further straight onward to the hill Gareb, and will turn toward Goah.
 <span class="verse"> 40</span><a name="C31V40">&nbsp;</a>The whole valley of the dead bodies and of the ashes, and all the fields to the brook Kidron, to the
corner of the horse gate toward the east, will be holy to Yahweh. It will not be plucked up or thrown
down any more forever.”
