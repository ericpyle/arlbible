 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C13V1">&nbsp;</a>And Simon heard that Tryphon had gathered together a mighty host to come into the land of Judah, and
destroy it utterly.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C13V2">&nbsp;</a>And he saw that the people trembled and was in great fear; and he went up to Jerusalem, and gathered
the people together;
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C13V3">&nbsp;</a>and he encouraged them, and said to them, You⌃ yourselves know all the things that I, and my brethren,
and my father’s house, have done for the laws and the sanctuary, and the battles and the distresses which
we have seen:
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C13V4">&nbsp;</a>by reason hereof all my brethren have perished for Israel’s sake, and I am left alone.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C13V5">&nbsp;</a>And now be it far from me, that I should spare mine own life in any time of affliction; for I am not
better than my brethren.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C13V6">&nbsp;</a>Howbeit I will take vengeance for my nation, and for the sanctuary, and for our wives and children; because
all the Gentiles are gathered to destroy us of very hatred.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C13V7">&nbsp;</a>And the spirit of the people revived, as soon as they heard these words.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C13V8">&nbsp;</a>And they answered with a loud voice, saying, You are our leader instead of Judas and Jonathan your brother.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C13V9">&nbsp;</a>Fight you our battles, and all that you shall say to us, that will we do.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C13V10">&nbsp;</a>And he gathered together all the men of war, and made haste to finish the walls of Jerusalem, and he
fortified it round about.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C13V11">&nbsp;</a>And he sent Jonathan the son of Absalom, and with him a great host, to Joppa: and he cast out them that
were therein, and abode there in it
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C13V12">&nbsp;</a>And Tryphon removed from Ptolemais with a mighty host to enter into the land of Judah, and Jonathan was
with him in ward.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C13V13">&nbsp;</a>But Simon encamped at Adida, over against the plain.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C13V14">&nbsp;</a>And Tryphon knew that Simon was risen up instead of his brother Jonathan, and meant to join battle with
him, and he sent ambassadors to him, saying,
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C13V15">&nbsp;</a>It is for money which Jonathan your brother owed to the king’s treasure, by reason of the offices which
he had, that we hold him fast.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C13V16">&nbsp;</a>And now send a hundred talents of silver, and two of his sons for hostages, that when he is set at liberty
he may not revolt from us, and we will set him at liberty.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C13V17">&nbsp;</a>And Simon knew that they spoke to him deceitfully; and he sends the money and the children, lest perhaps
he should procure to himself great hatred of the people,
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C13V18">&nbsp;</a>and they should say, Because I sent him not the money and the children, he perished.
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C13V19">&nbsp;</a>And he sent the children and the hundred talents. And he dealt falsely, and did not set Jonathan at liberty.
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C13V20">&nbsp;</a>And after this Tryphon came to invade the land, and destroy it, and he went round about by the way that
leads to Adora: and Simon and his army marched over against him to every place, wherever he went.
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C13V21">&nbsp;</a>Now they of the citadel sent to Tryphon ambassadors, hastening him to come to them through the wilderness,
and to send them food.
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C13V22">&nbsp;</a>And Tryphon made ready all his horse to come: and on that night there fell a very great snow, and he
came not by reason of the snow. And he removed, and came into the country of Gilead.
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C13V23">&nbsp;</a>But when he came near to Bascama, he killed Jonathan, and he was buried there.
 <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C13V24">&nbsp;</a>And Tryphon returned, and went away into his own land.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C13V25">&nbsp;</a>And Simon sent, and took the bones of Jonathan his brother, and buried him at Modin, the city of his
fathers.
 <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C13V26">&nbsp;</a>And all Israel made great lamentation over him, and mourned for him many days.
 <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C13V27">&nbsp;</a>And Simon built
<span class="add">a monument
</span> upon the sepulchre of his father and his brethren, and raised it aloft to the sight, with polished stone
behind and before.
 <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C13V28">&nbsp;</a>And he set up seven pyramids, one over against another, for his father, and his mother, and his four
brethren.
 <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C13V29">&nbsp;</a>And for these he made cunning devices, setting about them great pillars, and upon the pillars he fashioned

 <span class="verse"> 30</span><a name="C13V30">&nbsp;</a>This is the sepulchre which he made at Modin,
<span class="add">and it is there
</span> to this day.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 31</span><a name="C13V31">&nbsp;</a>Now Tryphon dealt deceitfully with the young king Antiochus, and killed him,
 <span class="verse"> 32</span><a name="C13V32">&nbsp;</a>and reigned in his stead, and put on himself the diadem of Asia, and brought a great calamity upon the
land.
 <span class="verse"> 33</span><a name="C13V33">&nbsp;</a>And Simon built the strongholds of Judaea, and fenced them about with high towers, and great walls, and
gates, and bars; and he laid up food in the strongholds.
 <span class="verse"> 34</span><a name="C13V34">&nbsp;</a>And Simon chose men, and sent to king Demetrius, to the end he should give the country an immunity, because
all that Tryphon did was to plunder.
 <span class="verse"> 35</span><a name="C13V35">&nbsp;</a>And king Demetrius sent to him according to these words, and answered him, and wrote a letter to him,
after this manner:

 Gazara, and compassed it round about with armies; and he made an engine of siege, and brought it up
to the city, and struck a tower, and took it.
 <span class="verse"> 44</span><a name="C13V44">&nbsp;</a>And they that were in the engine leaped forth into the city; and there was a great uproar in the city:
 <span class="verse"> 45</span><a name="C13V45">&nbsp;</a>and they of the city tore their clothes, and went up on the walls with their wives and children, and
cried with a loud voice, making request to Simon to give them

 <span class="verse"> 46</span><a name="C13V46">&nbsp;</a>And they said, Deal not with us according to our wickednesses, but according to your mercy.
 <span class="verse"> 47</span><a name="C13V47">&nbsp;</a>And Simon was reconciled to them, and did not fight against them: and he put them out of the city, and
cleansed the houses wherein the idols were, and so entered into it with singing and giving praise.
 <span class="verse"> 48</span><a name="C13V48">&nbsp;</a>And he put all uncleanness out of it, and placed in it such men as would keep the law, and made it stronger
than it was before, and built therein a dwelling place for himself.

<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 49</span><a name="C13V49">&nbsp;</a>But they of the citadel in Jerusalem were hindered from going forth, and from going into the country,
and from buying and selling; and they hungered exceedingly, and a great number of them perished through
famine.
 <span class="verse"> 50</span><a name="C13V50">&nbsp;</a>And they cried out to Simon, that he should give them his right hand; and he gave it to them: and he
put them out from thence, and he cleansed the citadel from its pollutions.
 <span class="verse"> 51</span><a name="C13V51">&nbsp;</a>And he entered into it on the three and twentieth day of the second month, in

 the hundred and seventy and first year, with praise and palm branches, and with harps, and with cymbals,
and with viols, and with hymns, and with songs: because a great enemy was destroyed out of Israel.
 <span class="verse"> 52</span><a name="C13V52">&nbsp;</a>And he ordained that they should keep that day every year with gladness. And the hill of the temple that
was by the citadel he made stronger than before, and there he lived, himself and his men.
