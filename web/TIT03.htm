 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C3V1">&nbsp;</a>Remind them to be in subjection to rulers and to authorities, to be obedient, to be ready for every good
work,
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C3V2">&nbsp;</a>to speak evil of no one, not to be contentious, to be gentle, showing all humility toward all men.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C3V3">&nbsp;</a>For we were also once foolish, disobedient, deceived, serving various lusts and pleasures, living in
malice and envy, hateful, and hating one another.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C3V4">&nbsp;</a>But when the kindness of God our Savior and his love toward mankind appeared,
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C3V5">&nbsp;</a>not by works of righteousness which we did ourselves, but according to his mercy, he saved us through
the washing of regeneration and renewing by the Holy Spirit,
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C3V6">&nbsp;</a>whom he poured out on us richly, through Jesus Christ our Savior;
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C3V7">&nbsp;</a>that being justified by his grace, we might be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C3V8">&nbsp;</a>This saying is faithful, and concerning these things I desire that you affirm confidently, so that those
who have believed God may be careful to maintain good works. These things are good and profitable to
men;
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C3V9">&nbsp;</a>but shun foolish questionings, genealogies, strife, and disputes about the law; for they are unprofitable
and vain.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C3V10">&nbsp;</a>Avoid a factious man after a first and second warning,
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C3V11">&nbsp;</a>knowing that such a one is perverted and sins, being self-condemned.

<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C3V12">&nbsp;</a>When I send Artemas to you, or Tychicus, be diligent to come to me to Nicopolis, for I have determined
to winter there.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C3V13">&nbsp;</a>Send Zenas, the lawyer, and Apollos on their journey speedily, that nothing may be lacking for them.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C3V14">&nbsp;</a>Let our people also learn to maintain good works for necessary uses, that they may not be unfruitful.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C3V15">&nbsp;</a>All who are with me greet you. Greet those who love us in faith. Grace be with you all. Amen.
