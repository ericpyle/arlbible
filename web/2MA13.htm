was coming with
<span class="add">great

and two and twenty elephants, and three hundred chariots armed with scythes.

<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C13V3">&nbsp;</a>And Menelaus also joined himself with them, and with great dissimulation encouraged Antiochus, not for
the saving of his country, but because he thought that he would be set over the government.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C13V4">&nbsp;</a>But the King of kings stirred up the
<a href="#FN2"><span class="notemark">†</span><span class="popup">Or,
spirit
</span></a>
 passion of Antiochus against the wicked wretch; and when Lysias informed him that this man was the cause
of all the evils,
<span class="add">the king
</span> commanded to bring him to Beroea, and
<a href="#FN3"><span class="notemark">‡</span><span class="popup">The Greek text here is perhaps corrupt.
</span></a>
 to put him to death after the manner of that place.

that had befallen
<span class="add">them
</span> in his father’s time.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C13V10">&nbsp;</a>But when Judas heard of these things, he gave charge to the multitude to call upon the Lord day and night,

their country and the holy temple,

 beseeching the merciful Lord with weeping and fastings and prostration for three days without ceasing,
Judas exhorted them and commanded they should join him
