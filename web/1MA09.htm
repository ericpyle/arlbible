 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C9V1">&nbsp;</a>And Demetrius heard that Nicanor was fallen with his forces in battle, and he sent Bacchides and Alcimus
again into the land of Judah a second time, and the right wing
<span class="add">of his army
</span> with them:
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C9V2">&nbsp;</a>and they went by the way that leads to Gilgal, and encamped against Mesaloth, which is in Arbela, and
got possession of it, and destroyed much people.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C9V3">&nbsp;</a>And the first month of
<a href="#FN1"><span class="notemark">*</span><span class="popup">circa B.C 161.
</span></a>
 the hundred and fifty and second year they encamped against Jerusalem:
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C9V4">&nbsp;</a>and they removed, and went to Berea, with twenty thousand footmen and two thousand horse.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C9V5">&nbsp;</a>And Judas was encamped at Elasa, and three thousand chosen men with him:
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C9V6">&nbsp;</a>and they saw the multitude of the forces, that they were many, and they feared exceedingly: and many
slipped away out of the army; there were not left of them more than eight hundred men.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C9V7">&nbsp;</a>And Judas saw that his army slipped away, and that the battle pressed upon him, and he was sore troubled
in heart, for that he had no time to gather them together, and he waxed faint.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C9V8">&nbsp;</a>And he said to them that were left, Let us arise and go up against our adversaries, if perhaps we may
be able to fight with them.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C9V9">&nbsp;</a>And they would have dissuaded him, saying, We shall in no wise be able: but let us rather save our lives
now: let us return again,
<span class="add">we
</span> and our brethren, and fight against them: but we are few.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C9V10">&nbsp;</a>And Judas said, let it not be so that I should do this thing, to flee from them: and if our time is come,
let us die manfully for our brethren’s sake, and not leave a cause of reproach against our glory.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C9V11">&nbsp;</a>And the host removed from the camp, and stood to encounter them, and the horse was parted into two companies,
and the slingers and the archers went before the host, and all the mighty men that fought in the front
of the battle.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C9V12">&nbsp;</a>But Bacchides was in the right wing; and the phalanx drew near on the two parts, and they blew with their
trumpets.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C9V13">&nbsp;</a>And the men of Judas’ side, even they sounded with their trumpets, and the earth shook with the shout
of the armies, and the battle was joined, and continued from morning until evening.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C9V14">&nbsp;</a>And Judas saw that Bacchides and the strength of his army were on the right side, and there went with
him all that were brave in heart,
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C9V15">&nbsp;</a>and the right wing was discomfited by them, and he pursued after them to the mount Azotus.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C9V16">&nbsp;</a>And they that were on the left wing saw that the right wing was discomfited, and they turned and followed
upon the footsteps of Judas and of those that were with him:
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C9V17">&nbsp;</a>and the battle waxed sore, and many on both parts fell wounded to death.
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C9V18">&nbsp;</a>And Judas fell, and the rest fled.
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C9V19">&nbsp;</a>And Jonathan and Simon took Judas their brother, and buried him in the sepulchre of his fathers at Modin.
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C9V20">&nbsp;</a>And they bewailed him, and all Israel made great lamentation for him, and mourned many days, and said,
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C9V21">&nbsp;</a>How is the mighty fallen, the savior of Israel!
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C9V22">&nbsp;</a>And the rest of the acts of Judas, and his wars, and the valiant deeds which he did, and his greatness,
they are not written; for they were exceeding many.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C9V23">&nbsp;</a>And it came to pass after the death of Judas, that the lawless put forth their heads in all the coasts
of Israel, and all they that wrought iniquity rose up
 <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C9V24">&nbsp;</a>(in those days there was an exceeding great famine), and the country went over with them.
 <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C9V25">&nbsp;</a>And Bacchides chose out the ungodly men, and made them lords of the country.
 <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C9V26">&nbsp;</a>And they sought out and searched for the friends of Judas, and brought them to Bacchides, and he took
vengeance on them, and used them despitefully.
 <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C9V27">&nbsp;</a>And there was great tribulation in Israel, such as was not since the time that no prophet appeared to
them.
 <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C9V28">&nbsp;</a>And all the friends of Judas were gathered together, and they said to Jonathan,
 <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C9V29">&nbsp;</a>Since your brother Judas has died, we have no man like him to go forth against our enemies and Bacchides,
and among them of our nation that hate us.
 <span class="verse"> 30</span><a name="C9V30">&nbsp;</a>Now therefore we have chosen you this day to be our prince and leader in his stead, that you may fight
our battles.
 <span class="verse"> 31</span><a name="C9V31">&nbsp;</a>And Jonathan took the governance upon him at that time, and rose up in the stead of his brother Judas.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 32</span><a name="C9V32">&nbsp;</a>And Bacchides knew it, and he sought to kill him.
 <span class="verse"> 33</span><a name="C9V33">&nbsp;</a>And Jonathan, and Simon his brother, and all that were with him, knew it; and they fled into the wilderness
of Tekoah, and encamped by the water of the pool Asphar.
 <span class="verse"> 34</span><a name="C9V34">&nbsp;</a>And Bacchides knew it on the Sabbath day, and came, he and all his army, over Jordan.
 <span class="verse"> 35</span><a name="C9V35">&nbsp;</a>And
<span class="add">Jonathan
</span> sent his brother, a leader of the multitude, and implored his friends the Nabathaeans, that they might
leave with them their baggage, which was much.
 <span class="verse"> 36</span><a name="C9V36">&nbsp;</a>And the children of Jambri came out of Medaba, and took John, and all that he had, and went their way
with it.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 37</span><a name="C9V37">&nbsp;</a>But after these things they brought word to Jonathan and Simon his brother, that the children of Jambri
were making a great marriage, and were bringing the bride from Nadabath with a great train, a daughter
of one of the great nobles of Canaan.
 <span class="verse"> 38</span><a name="C9V38">&nbsp;</a>And they remembered John their brother, and went up, and hid themselves under the covert of the mountain:
 <span class="verse"> 39</span><a name="C9V39">&nbsp;</a>and they lifted up their eyes, and saw, and, behold, a great ado and much baggage: and the bridegroom
came forth, and his friends and his brethren, to meet them with timbrels, and minstrels, and many weapons.
 <span class="verse"> 40</span><a name="C9V40">&nbsp;</a>And they rose up against them from their ambush, and killed them, and many fell wounded to death, and
the remnant fled into the mountain, and they took all their spoils.
 <span class="verse"> 41</span><a name="C9V41">&nbsp;</a>And the marriage was turned into mourning, and the voice of their minstrels into lamentation.
 <span class="verse"> 42</span><a name="C9V42">&nbsp;</a>And they avenged fully the blood of their brother, and turned back to the marsh of Jordan
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 43</span><a name="C9V43">&nbsp;</a>And Bacchides heard it, and he came on the Sabbath day to the banks of Jordan with a great host.
 <span class="verse"> 44</span><a name="C9V44">&nbsp;</a>And Jonathan said to his company, Let us stand up now and fight for our lives, for it is not
<span class="add">with us
</span> today, as yesterday and the day before.
 <span class="verse"> 45</span><a name="C9V45">&nbsp;</a>For, behold, the battle is before us and behind us; moreover the water of the Jordan is on this side
and on that side, and marsh and wood; and there is no place to turn aside.
 <span class="verse"> 46</span><a name="C9V46">&nbsp;</a>Now therefore cry to heaven, that you⌃ may be delivered out of the hand of your enemies.
 <span class="verse"> 47</span><a name="C9V47">&nbsp;</a>And the battle was joined, and Jonathan stretched forth his hand to strike Bacchides, and he turned away
back from him.
 <span class="verse"> 48</span><a name="C9V48">&nbsp;</a>And Jonathan and they that were with him leapt into the Jordan, and swam over to the other side: and
they did not pass over Jordan against them.
 <span class="verse"> 49</span><a name="C9V49">&nbsp;</a>And there fell of Bacchides’ company that day about a thousand men;
 <span class="verse"> 50</span><a name="C9V50">&nbsp;</a>and he returned to Jerusalem. And they builded strong cities in Judaea, the stronghold that was in Jericho,
and Emmaus, and Bethhoron, and Bethel, and Timnath, Pharathon, and Tephon, with high walls and gates
and bars.
 <span class="verse"> 51</span><a name="C9V51">&nbsp;</a>And in them he set a garrison, to vex Israel.
 <span class="verse"> 52</span><a name="C9V52">&nbsp;</a>And he fortified the city Bethsura, and Gazara, and the citadel, and put forces in them, and store of
food.
 <span class="verse"> 53</span><a name="C9V53">&nbsp;</a>And he took the sons of the chief men of the country for hostages, and put them in ward in the citadel
at Jerusalem.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 54</span><a name="C9V54">&nbsp;</a>And in
<a href="#FN2"><span class="notemark">†</span><span class="popup">circa B.C 160.
</span></a>
 the hundred and fifty and third year, in the second month, Alcimus commanded to pull down the wall of
the inner court of the sanctuary; he pulled down also the works of the prophets;
 <span class="verse"> 55</span><a name="C9V55">&nbsp;</a>and he began to pull down. At that time was Alcimus stricken, and his works were hindered; and his mouth
was stopped, and he was taken with a palsy, and he could no more speak anything and give order concerning
his house.
 <span class="verse"> 56</span><a name="C9V56">&nbsp;</a>And Alcimus died at that time with great torment.
 <span class="verse"> 57</span><a name="C9V57">&nbsp;</a>And Bacchides saw that Alcimus was dead, and he returned to the king: and the land of Judah had rest
two years.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 58</span><a name="C9V58">&nbsp;</a>And all the lawless men took counsel, saying, Behold, Jonathan and they of his part are dwelling at ease,
and in security: now therefore we will bring Bacchides, and he shall lay hands on them all in one night.
 <span class="verse"> 59</span><a name="C9V59">&nbsp;</a>And they went and consulted with him.
 <span class="verse"> 60</span><a name="C9V60">&nbsp;</a>And he removed, and came with a great host, and sent letters privily to all his confederates that were
in Judaea, that they should lay hands on Jonathan and those that were with him: and they could not, because
their counsel was known to them.
 <span class="verse"> 61</span><a name="C9V61">&nbsp;</a>And
<span class="add">they that were of Jonathan’s part
</span> laid hands on about fifty of the men of the country, that were authors of the wickedness, and he killed
them.
 <span class="verse"> 62</span><a name="C9V62">&nbsp;</a>And Jonathan, and Simon, and they that were with him, got them away to Bethbasi, which is in the wilderness,
and he built up that which had been pulled down thereof, and they made it strong.
 <span class="verse"> 63</span><a name="C9V63">&nbsp;</a>And Bacchides knew it, and he gathered together all his multitude, and sent word to them that were of
Judaea.
 <span class="verse"> 64</span><a name="C9V64">&nbsp;</a>And he went and encamped against Bethbasi, and fought against it many days, and made engines of war.
 <span class="verse"> 65</span><a name="C9V65">&nbsp;</a>And Jonathan left his brother Simon in the city, and went forth into the country, and he went with a
few men.
 <span class="verse"> 66</span><a name="C9V66">&nbsp;</a>And he struck Odomera and his brethren, and the children of Phasiron in their tent.
 <span class="verse"> 67</span><a name="C9V67">&nbsp;</a>And they began to strike them, and to go up with their forces. And Simon and they that were with him
went out of the city, and set on fire the engines of war,
 <span class="verse"> 68</span><a name="C9V68">&nbsp;</a>and fought against Bacchides, and he was discomfited by them, and they afflicted him sore; for his counsel
was in vain, and his inroad.
 <span class="verse"> 69</span><a name="C9V69">&nbsp;</a>And they were very angry with the lawless men that gave him counsel to come into the country, and they
killed many of them. And he took counsel to depart into his own land.
 <span class="verse"> 70</span><a name="C9V70">&nbsp;</a>And Jonathan had knowledge thereof, and sent ambassadors to him, to the end that they should make peace
with him, and that he should restore to them the captives.
 <span class="verse"> 71</span><a name="C9V71">&nbsp;</a>And he accepted the thing, and did according to his words, and sware to him that he would not seek his
hurt all the days of his life.
 <span class="verse"> 72</span><a name="C9V72">&nbsp;</a>And he restored to him the captives which he had taken aforetime out of the land of Judah, and he returned
and departed into his own land, and came not any more into their borders.
 <span class="verse"> 73</span><a name="C9V73">&nbsp;</a>And the sword ceased from Israel. And Jonathan lived at Michmash; and Jonathan began to judge the people;
and he destroyed the ungodly out of Israel.
