 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C11V2">&nbsp;</a>As they traveled east, they found a plain in the land of Shinar, and they lived there.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C11V3">&nbsp;</a>They said to one another, “Come, let’s make bricks, and burn them thoroughly.” They had brick for stone,
and they used tar for mortar.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C11V4">&nbsp;</a>They said, “Come, let’s build ourselves a city, and a tower whose top reaches to the sky, and let’s make
a name for ourselves, lest we be scattered abroad on the surface of the whole earth.”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C11V5">&nbsp;</a>Yahweh came down to see the city and the tower, which the children of men built.

to do. Now nothing will be withheld from them, which they intend to do.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C11V7">&nbsp;</a>Come, let’s go down, and there confuse their language, that they may not understand one another’s speech.”
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C11V8">&nbsp;</a>So Yahweh scattered them abroad from there on the surface of all the earth. They stopped building the
city.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C11V9">&nbsp;</a>Therefore its name was called Babel, because there Yahweh confused the language of all the earth. From
there, Yahweh scattered them abroad on the surface of all the earth.
