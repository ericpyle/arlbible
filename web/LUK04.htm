<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 31</span><a name="C4V31">&nbsp;</a>He came down to Capernaum, a city of Galilee. He was teaching them on the Sabbath day,
 <span class="verse"> 32</span><a name="C4V32">&nbsp;</a>and they were astonished at his teaching, for his word was with authority.
 <span class="verse"> 33</span><a name="C4V33">&nbsp;</a>In the synagogue there was a man who had a spirit of an unclean demon, and he cried out with a loud voice,
 <span class="verse"> 34</span><a name="C4V34">&nbsp;</a>saying, “Ah! what have we to do with you, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know you
who you are: the Holy One of God!”

<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 38</span><a name="C4V38">&nbsp;</a>He rose up from the synagogue, and entered into Simon’s house. Simon’s mother-in-law was afflicted with
a great fever, and they begged him for her.

 <span class="verse"> 40</span><a name="C4V40">&nbsp;</a>When the sun was setting, all those who had any sick with various diseases brought them to him; and he
laid his hands on every one of them, and healed them.
 <span class="verse"> 41</span><a name="C4V41">&nbsp;</a>Demons also came out of many, crying out, and saying, “You are the Christ, the Son of God!” Rebuking
them, he didn’t allow them to speak, because they knew that he was the Christ.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 42</span><a name="C4V42">&nbsp;</a>When it was day, he departed and went into an uninhabited place, and the multitudes looked for him, and
came to him, and held on to him, so that he wouldn’t go away from them.
 <span class="verse"> 43</span><a name="C4V43">&nbsp;</a>But he said to them,
<span class="wj">“I must preach the good news of God’s Kingdom to the other cities also. For this reason I have been sent.”</span> <span class="verse"> 44</span><a name="C4V44">&nbsp;</a>He was preaching in the synagogues of Galilee.
