of plague in the house.’

greenish or reddish, and it appears to be deeper than the wall;

an unclean place outside of the city:
 <span class="verse"> 41</span><a name="C14V41">&nbsp;</a>and he shall cause the inside of the house to be scraped all over, and they shall pour out the mortar,
that they scraped off, outside of the city into an unclean place.

mildew in the house. It is unclean.
 <span class="verse"> 45</span><a name="C14V45">&nbsp;</a>He shall break down the house, its stones, and its timber, and all the house’s mortar. He shall carry
