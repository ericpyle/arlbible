<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C3V2">&nbsp;</a>O Lord, you are righteous, and all your works and all your ways are mercy and truth, and you judge true
and righteous judgement for ever.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C3V3">&nbsp;</a>Remember me, and look on me; take not vengeance on me for my sins and mine ignorances, and
<span class="add">the sins
</span> of my fathers, which sinned before you:
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C3V4">&nbsp;</a>for they disobeyed your commandments; and you gave us for a spoil, and for captivity, and for death,
and for a proverb of reproach to all the nations among whom we are dispersed.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C3V5">&nbsp;</a>And now many are your judgments, true are they; that you should deal with me according to my sins and
<span class="add">the sins
</span> of my fathers: because we did not keep your commandments, for we walked not in truth before you.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C3V6">&nbsp;</a>And now deal with me according to that which is pleasing in your sight, command my spirit to be taken
from me, that I may be released, and become earth: for it is profitable for me to die rather than to
live, because I have heard false reproaches, and there is much sorrow in me: command that I be now released
from my distress, and go to the everlasting place: turn not your face away from me.

<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C3V7">&nbsp;</a>The same day it happened to Sarah the daughter of Raguel in Ecbatana of Media, that she also was reproached
by her father’s maidservants;
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C3V8">&nbsp;</a>because that she had been given to seven husbands, and Asmodaeus the evil

 spirit killed them, before they had lain with her. And they said to her, Do you not know that you strangle
your husbands? you have had already seven husbands, and you have had no profit of any one of them.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C3V9">&nbsp;</a>Wherefore do you scourge us? if they be dead, go your ways with them; let us never see of you either
son or daughter.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C3V10">&nbsp;</a>When she heard these things, she was grieved exceedingly, so that she thought to have hanged herself:
and she said, I am the only daughter of my father; if I do this, it shall be a reproach to him, and I
shall bring down his old age with sorrow to
<a href="#FN2"><span class="notemark">†</span><span class="popup">Gr.

</span></a>
 the grave.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C3V11">&nbsp;</a>And she prayed by the window, and said, Blessed are you, O Lord my God, and blessed is your holy and
honorable name for ever: let all your works praise you for ever.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C3V12">&nbsp;</a>And now, Lord, I have set mine eyes and my face toward you:
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C3V13">&nbsp;</a>command that I be released from the earth, and that I no more hear reproach.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C3V14">&nbsp;</a>You know, Lord, that I am pure from all sin with man,
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C3V15">&nbsp;</a>and that I never polluted my name, nor the name of my father, in the land of my captivity: I am the only
daughter of my father, and he has no child that shall be his heir, nor brother near him, nor son belonging
to him, that I should keep myself for a wife to him: seven husbands of mine are dead already; why should
I live? And if it pleases you not to kill me, command some regard to be had of me, and pity taken of
me, and that I hear no more reproach.

and enter into his house, and Sarah the daughter of Raguel came down from her upper chamber.
