 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C10V1">&nbsp;</a>Dead flies cause the oil of the perfumer to produce an evil odor;
</div>
<div class="q2">so does a little folly outweigh wisdom and honor.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C10V2">&nbsp;</a>A wise man’s heart is at his right hand,
</div>
<div class="q2">but a fool’s heart at his left.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C10V3">&nbsp;</a>Yes also, when the fool walks by the way, his understanding fails him, and he says to everyone that he
is a fool.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C10V4">&nbsp;</a>If the spirit of the ruler rises up against you, don’t leave your place; for gentleness lays great offenses
to rest.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C10V5">&nbsp;</a>There is an evil which I have seen under the sun, the sort of error which proceeds from the ruler.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C10V6">&nbsp;</a>Folly is set in great dignity, and the rich sit in a low place.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C10V7">&nbsp;</a>I have seen servants on horses, and princes walking like servants on the earth.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C10V8">&nbsp;</a>He who digs a pit may fall into it; and whoever breaks through a wall may be bitten by a snake.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C10V9">&nbsp;</a>Whoever carves out stones may be injured by them. Whoever splits wood may be endangered thereby.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C10V10">&nbsp;</a>If the ax is blunt, and one doesn’t sharpen the edge, then he must use more strength; but skill brings
success.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C10V11">&nbsp;</a>If the snake bites before it is charmed, then is there no profit for the charmer’s tongue.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C10V12">&nbsp;</a>The words of a wise man’s mouth are gracious; but a fool is swallowed by his own lips.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C10V13">&nbsp;</a>The beginning of the words of his mouth is foolishness; and the end of his talk is mischievous madness.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C10V14">&nbsp;</a>A fool also multiplies words.
</div>
<div class="p">Man doesn’t know what will be; and that which will be after him, who can tell him?
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C10V15">&nbsp;</a>The labor of fools wearies every one of them; for he doesn’t know how to go to the city.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C10V16">&nbsp;</a>Woe to you, land, when your king is a child,
</div>
<div class="q2">and your princes eat in the morning!
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C10V17">&nbsp;</a>Happy are you, land, when your king is the son of nobles,
</div>
<div class="q2">and your princes eat in due season,
</div>
<div class="q2">for strength, and not for drunkenness!
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C10V18">&nbsp;</a>By slothfulness the roof sinks in;
</div>
<div class="q2">and through idleness of the hands the house leaks.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C10V19">&nbsp;</a>A feast is made for laughter,
</div>
<div class="q2">and wine makes the life glad;
</div>
<div class="q2">and money is the answer for all things.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C10V20">&nbsp;</a>Don’t curse the king, no, not in your thoughts;
</div>
<div class="q2">and don’t curse the rich in your bedroom:
</div>
<div class="q2">for a bird of the sky may carry your voice,
</div>
<div class="q2">and that which has wings may tell the matter.
