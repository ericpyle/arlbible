 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C16V1">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">“I have said these things to you so that you wouldn’t be caused to stumble.
</span> <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C16V2">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">They will put you out of the synagogues. Yes, the time comes that whoever kills you will think that he
offers service to God.
</span> <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C16V3">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">They will do these things</span><a href="#FN1"><span class="notemark">*</span><span class="popup">TR adds “to you”</span></a>
<span class="wj">because they have not known the Father, nor me.
</span> <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C16V4">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">But I have told you these things, so that when the time comes, you may remember that I told you about
them. I didn’t tell you these things from the beginning, because I was with you.
</span> <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C16V5">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">But now I am going to him who sent me, and none of you asks me, ‘Where are you going?’
</span> <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C16V6">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">But because I have told you these things, sorrow has filled your heart.
</span> <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C16V7">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Nevertheless I tell you the truth: It is to your advantage that I go away, for if I don’t go away, the
Counselor won’t come to you. But if I go, I will send him to you.
</span> <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C16V8">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">When he has come, he will convict the world about sin, about righteousness, and about judgment;
</span> <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C16V9">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">about sin, because they don’t believe in me;
</span> <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C16V10">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">about righteousness, because I am going to my Father, and you won’t see me any more;
</span> <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C16V11">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">about judgment, because the prince of this world has been judged.
</span></div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C16V12">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">“I have yet many things to tell you, but you can’t bear them now.
</span> <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C16V13">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">However when he, the Spirit of truth, has come, he will guide you into all truth, for he will not speak
from himself; but whatever he hears, he will speak. He will declare to you things that are coming.
</span> <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C16V14">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">He will glorify me, for he will take from what is mine, and will declare it to you.
</span> <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C16V15">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">All things whatever the Father has are mine; therefore I said that he takes</span><a href="#FN2"><span class="notemark">†</span><span class="popup">TR reads “will take” instead of “takes”</span></a>
<span class="wj">of mine, and will declare it to you.
</span> <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C16V16">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">A little while, and you will not see me. Again a little while, and you will see me.”</span></div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C16V17">&nbsp;</a>Some of his disciples therefore said to one another, “What is this that he says to us,
<span class="wj">‘A little while, and you won’t see me, and again a little while, and you will see me;’</span> and,
<span class="wj">‘Because I go to the Father’</span>?”
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C16V18">&nbsp;</a>They said therefore, “What is this that he says,
<span class="wj">‘A little while’</span>? We don’t know what he is saying.”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C16V19">&nbsp;</a>Therefore Jesus perceived that they wanted to ask him, and he said to them,
<span class="wj">“Do you inquire among yourselves concerning this, that I said, ‘A little while, and you won’t see me,
and again a little while, and you will see me?’
</span> <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C16V20">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Most certainly I tell you, that you will weep and lament, but the world will rejoice. You will be sorrowful,
but your sorrow will be turned into joy.
</span> <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C16V21">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">A woman, when she gives birth, has sorrow, because her time has come. But when she has delivered the
child, she doesn’t remember the anguish any more, for the joy that a human being is born into the world.
</span> <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C16V22">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Therefore you now have sorrow, but I will see you again, and your heart will rejoice, and no one will
take your joy away from you.</span></div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C16V23">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">“In that day you will ask me no questions. Most certainly I tell you, whatever you may ask of the Father
in my name, he will give it to you.
</span> <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C16V24">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Until now, you have asked nothing in my name. Ask, and you will receive, that your joy may be made full.
</span> <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C16V25">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">I have spoken these things to you in figures of speech. But the time is coming when I will no more speak
to you in figures of speech, but will tell you plainly about the Father.
</span> <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C16V26">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">In that day you will ask in my name; and I don’t say to you, that I will pray to the Father for you,
</span> <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C16V27">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">for the Father himself loves you, because you have loved me, and have believed that I came from God.
</span> <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C16V28">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">I came from the Father, and have come into the world. Again, I leave the world, and go to the Father.”</span></div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C16V29">&nbsp;</a>His disciples said to him, “Behold, now you speak plainly, and speak no figures of speech.
 <span class="verse"> 30</span><a name="C16V30">&nbsp;</a>Now we know that you know all things, and don’t need for anyone to question you. By this we believe that
you came from God.”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 31</span><a name="C16V31">&nbsp;</a>Jesus answered them,
<span class="wj">“Do you now believe?
</span> <span class="verse"> 32</span><a name="C16V32">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Behold, the time is coming, yes, and has now come, that you will be scattered, everyone to his own place,
and you will leave me alone. Yet I am not alone, because the Father is with me.
</span> <span class="verse"> 33</span><a name="C16V33">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">I have told you these things, that in me you may have peace. In the world you have oppression; but cheer
up! I have overcome the world.”
