 <span class="verse" id="V1">1&nbsp;</span>And what wonder? if the lusts of the soul, after participation with what is beautiful, are frustrated,  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span>on this ground, therefore, the temperate Joseph is praised in that by reasoning, he subdued, on reflection, the indulgence of sense.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>For, although young, and ripe for sexual intercourse, he abrogated by reasoning the stimulus of his passions.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>And it is not merely the stimulus of sensual indulgence, but that of every desire, that reasoning is able to master.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>For instance, the law says, You shall not covet your neighbor’s wife, nor anything that belongs to your neighbor.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>Now, then, since it is the law which has forbidden us to desire, I shall much the more easily persuade you, that reasoning is able to govern our lusts, just as it does the affections which are impediments to justice.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>Since in what way is a solitary eater, and a glutton, and a drunkard reclaimed, unless it be clear that reasoning is lord of the passions?  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>A man, therefore, who regulates his course by the law, even if he be a lover of money, straightway puts force upon his own disposition; lending to the needy without interest, and cancelling the debt of the incoming Sabbath.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>And should a man be parsimonious, he is ruled by the law acting through reasoning; so that he does not glean his harvest crops, nor vintage: and in reference to other points we may perceive that it is reasoning that conquers his passions.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>For the law conquers even affection toward parents, not surrendering virtue on their account.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>And it prevails over marriage love, condemning it when transgressing law.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>And it lords it over the love of parents toward their children, for they punish them for vice; and it domineers over the intimacy of friends, reproving them when wicked.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>And think it not a strange assertion that reasoning can in behalf of the law conquer even enmity.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>It allows not to cut down the cultivated herbage of an enemy, but preserves it from the destroyers, and collects their fallen ruins.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>And reason appears to be master of the more violent passions, as love of empire and empty boasting, and slander.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>For the temperate understanding repels all these malignant passions, as it does wrath: for it masters even this.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>Thus Moses, when angered against Dathan and Abiram, did nothing to them in wrath, but regulated his anger by reasoning.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>For the temperate mind is able, as I said, to be superior to the passions, and to transfer some, and destroy others.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>For why, else, does our most wise father Jacob blame Simeon and Levi for having irrationally slain the whole race of the Shechemites, saying, Cursed be their anger.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>For if reasoning did not possess the power of subduing angry affections, he would not have spoken thus.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>For at the time when God created man, He implanted within him his passions and moral nature.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>And at that time He enthroned above all the holy leader mind, through the medium of the senses.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>And He gave a law to this mind, by living according to which it will maintain a temperate, and just, and good, and manly reign.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>How, then, a man may say, if reasoning be master of the passions, has it no control over forgetfulness and ignorance? </div><ul class='tnav'>
