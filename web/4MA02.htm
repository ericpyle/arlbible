 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C2V1">&nbsp;</a>And what wonder? if the lusts of the soul, after participation with what is beautiful, are frustrated,
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C2V2">&nbsp;</a>on this ground, therefore, the temperate Joseph is praised in that by reasoning, he subdued, on reflection,
the indulgence of sense.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C2V3">&nbsp;</a>For, although young, and ripe for sexual intercourse, he abrogated by reasoning the stimulus of his passions.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C2V4">&nbsp;</a>And it is not merely the stimulus of sensual indulgence, but that of every desire, that reasoning is
able to master.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C2V5">&nbsp;</a>For instance, the law says, You shall not covet your neighbor’s wife, nor anything that belongs to your
neighbor.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C2V6">&nbsp;</a>Now, then, since it is the law which has forbidden us to desire, I shall much the more easily persuade
you, that reasoning is able to govern our lusts, just as it does the affections which are impediments
to justice.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C2V7">&nbsp;</a>Since in what way is a solitary eater, and a glutton, and a drunkard reclaimed, unless it be clear that
reasoning is lord of the passions?
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C2V8">&nbsp;</a>A man, therefore, who regulates his course by the law, even if he be a lover of money, straightway puts
force upon his own disposition; lending to the needy without interest, and cancelling the debt of the
incoming Sabbath.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C2V9">&nbsp;</a>And should a man be parsimonious, he is ruled by the law acting through reasoning; so that he does not
glean his harvest crops, nor vintage: and in reference to other points we may perceive that it is reasoning
that conquers his passions.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C2V10">&nbsp;</a>For the law conquers even affection toward parents, not surrendering virtue on their account.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C2V11">&nbsp;</a>And it prevails over marriage love, condemning it when transgressing law.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C2V12">&nbsp;</a>And it lords it over the love of parents toward their children, for they punish them for vice; and it
domineers over the intimacy of friends, reproving them when wicked.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C2V13">&nbsp;</a>And think it not a strange assertion that reasoning can in behalf of the law conquer even enmity.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C2V14">&nbsp;</a>It allows not to cut down the cultivated herbage of an enemy, but preserves it from the destroyers, and
collects their fallen ruins.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C2V15">&nbsp;</a>And reason appears to be master of the more violent passions, as love of empire and empty boasting, and
slander.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C2V16">&nbsp;</a>For the temperate understanding repels all these malignant passions, as it does wrath: for it masters
even this.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C2V17">&nbsp;</a>Thus Moses, when angered against Dathan and Abiram, did nothing to them in wrath, but regulated his anger
by reasoning.
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C2V18">&nbsp;</a>For the temperate mind is able, as I said, to be superior to the passions, and to transfer some, and
destroy others.
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C2V19">&nbsp;</a>For why, else, does our most wise father Jacob blame Simeon and Levi for having irrationally slain the
whole race of the Shechemites, saying, Cursed be their anger.
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C2V20">&nbsp;</a>For if reasoning did not possess the power of subduing angry affections, he would not have spoken thus.
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C2V21">&nbsp;</a>For at the time when God created man, He implanted within him his passions and moral nature.
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C2V22">&nbsp;</a>And at that time He enthroned above all the holy leader mind, through the medium of the senses.
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C2V23">&nbsp;</a>And He gave a law to this mind, by living according to which it will maintain a temperate, and just,
and good, and manly reign.
 <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C2V24">&nbsp;</a>How, then, a man may say, if reasoning be master of the passions, has it no control over forgetfulness
and ignorance?
