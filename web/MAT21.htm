 to the Mount of Olives, then Jesus sent two disciples,
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C21V2">&nbsp;</a>saying to them,
<span class="wj">“Go into the village that is opposite you, and immediately you will find a donkey tied, and a colt with
her. Untie them, and bring them to me.
</span> <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C21V3">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">If anyone says anything to you, you shall say, ‘The Lord needs them,’ and immediately he will send them.”</span></div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C21V4">&nbsp;</a>All this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through the prophet, saying,

 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C21V7">&nbsp;</a>and brought the donkey and the colt, and laid their clothes on them; and he sat on them.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C21V8">&nbsp;</a>A very great multitude spread their clothes on the road. Others cut branches from the trees, and spread
them on the road.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C21V9">&nbsp;</a>The multitudes who went in front of him, and those who followed, kept shouting, “Hosanna

<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C21V10">&nbsp;</a>When he had come into Jerusalem, all the city was stirred up, saying, “Who is this?”
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C21V11">&nbsp;</a>The multitudes said, “This is the prophet, Jesus, from Nazareth of Galilee.”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C21V12">&nbsp;</a>Jesus entered into the temple of God, and drove out all of those who sold and bought in the temple, and
overthrew the money changers’ tables and the seats of those who sold the doves.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C21V13">&nbsp;</a>He said to them,
<span class="wj">“It is written, ‘My house shall be called a house of prayer,’</span><a href="#FN5"><span class="notemark"></span><span class="popup">+ Isaiah 56:7</span></a>

<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C21V14">&nbsp;</a>The blind and the lame came to him in the temple, and he healed them.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C21V15">&nbsp;</a>But when the chief priests and the scribes saw the wonderful things that he did, and the children who
were crying in the temple and saying, “Hosanna to the son of David!” they were indignant,
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C21V16">&nbsp;</a>and said to him, “Do you hear what these are saying?”
</div>
<div class="p">Jesus said to them,
<span class="wj">“Yes. Did you never read, ‘Out of the mouth of babes and nursing babies you have perfected praise?’”</span><a href="#FN7"><span class="notemark"></span><span class="popup">+ Psalm 8:2</span></a>
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C21V17">&nbsp;</a>He left them, and went out of the city to Bethany, and camped there.
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C21V18">&nbsp;</a>Now in the morning, as he returned to the city, he was hungry.
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C21V19">&nbsp;</a>Seeing a fig tree by the road, he came to it, and found nothing on it but leaves. He said to it,
<span class="wj">“Let there be no fruit from you forever!”
</span></div>
<div class="p">Immediately the fig tree withered away.
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C21V20">&nbsp;</a>When the disciples saw it, they marveled, saying, “How did the fig tree immediately wither away?”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C21V21">&nbsp;</a>Jesus answered them,
<span class="wj">“Most certainly I tell you, if you have faith, and don’t doubt, you will not only do what was done to
the fig tree, but even if you told this mountain, ‘Be taken up and cast into the sea,’ it would be done.
</span> <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C21V22">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">All things, whatever you ask in prayer, believing, you will receive.”</span></div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C21V23">&nbsp;</a>When he had come into the temple, the chief priests and the elders of the people came to him as he was
teaching, and said, “By what authority do you do these things? Who gave you this authority?”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C21V24">&nbsp;</a>Jesus answered them,
<span class="wj">“I also will ask you one question, which if you tell me, I likewise will tell you by what authority I
do these things.
</span> <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C21V25">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">The baptism of John, where was it from? From heaven or from men?”
</span></div>
<div class="p">They reasoned with themselves, saying, “If we say, ‘From heaven,’ he will ask us, ‘Why then did you not
believe him?’
 <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C21V26">&nbsp;</a>But if we say, ‘From men,’ we fear the multitude, for all hold John as a prophet.”
 <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C21V27">&nbsp;</a>They answered Jesus, and said, “We don’t know.”
</div>
<div class="p">He also said to them,
<span class="wj">“Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things.
</span> <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C21V28">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">But what do you think? A man had two sons, and he came to the first, and said, ‘Son, go work today in
my vineyard.’
</span> <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C21V29">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">He answered, ‘I will not,’ but afterward he changed his mind, and went.
</span> <span class="verse"> 30</span><a name="C21V30">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">He came to the second, and said the same thing. He answered, ‘I go, sir,’ but he didn’t go.
</span> <span class="verse"> 31</span><a name="C21V31">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Which of the two did the will of his father?”</span></div>
<div class="p">They said to him, “The first.”
</div>
<div class="p">Jesus said to them,
<span class="wj">“Most certainly I tell you that the tax collectors and the prostitutes are entering into God’s Kingdom
before you.
</span> <span class="verse"> 32</span><a name="C21V32">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">For John came to you in the way of righteousness, and you didn’t believe him, but the tax collectors
and the prostitutes believed him. When you saw it, you didn’t even repent afterward, that you might believe
him.
</span></div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 33</span><a name="C21V33">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">“Hear another parable. There was a man who was a master of a household, who planted a vineyard, set a
hedge about it, dug a wine press in it, built a tower, leased it out to farmers, and went into another
country.
</span> <span class="verse"> 34</span><a name="C21V34">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">When the season for the fruit came near, he sent his servants to the farmers, to receive his fruit.
</span> <span class="verse"> 35</span><a name="C21V35">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">The farmers took his servants, beat one, killed another, and stoned another.
</span> <span class="verse"> 36</span><a name="C21V36">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Again, he sent other servants more than the first: and they treated them the same way.
</span> <span class="verse"> 37</span><a name="C21V37">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">But afterward he sent to them his son, saying, ‘They will respect my son.’
</span> <span class="verse"> 38</span><a name="C21V38">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">But the farmers, when they saw the son, said among themselves, ‘This is the heir. Come, let’s kill him,
and seize his inheritance.’
</span> <span class="verse"> 39</span><a name="C21V39">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">So they took him, and threw him out of the vineyard, and killed him.
</span> <span class="verse"> 40</span><a name="C21V40">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">When therefore the lord of the vineyard comes, what will he do to those farmers?”</span></div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 41</span><a name="C21V41">&nbsp;</a>They told him, “He will miserably destroy those miserable men, and will lease out the vineyard to other
farmers, who will give him the fruit in its season.”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 42</span><a name="C21V42">&nbsp;</a>Jesus said to them,
<span class="wj">“Did you never read in the Scriptures,
</span></div>
<div class="q1"><span class="wj">‘The stone which the builders rejected,</span></div>
<div class="q2"><span class="wj">the same was made the head of the corner.</span></div>
<div class="q1"><span class="wj">This was from the Lord.</span></div>
<div class="q2"><span class="wj">It is marvelous in our eyes?’</span><a href="#FN8"><span class="notemark"></span><span class="popup">+ Psalm 118:22-23</span></a>
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 43</span><a name="C21V43">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">“Therefore I tell you, God’s Kingdom will be taken away from you, and will be given to a nation producing
its fruit.
</span> <span class="verse"> 44</span><a name="C21V44">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">He who falls on this stone will be broken to pieces, but on whomever it will fall, it will scatter him
as dust.”</span></div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 45</span><a name="C21V45">&nbsp;</a>When the chief priests and the Pharisees heard his parables, they perceived that he spoke about them.
 <span class="verse"> 46</span><a name="C21V46">&nbsp;</a>When they sought to seize him, they feared the multitudes, because they considered him to be a prophet.
