 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C18V1">&nbsp;</a>He also spoke a parable to them that they must always pray, and not give up,
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C18V2">&nbsp;</a>saying,
<span class="wj">“There was a judge in a certain city who didn’t fear God, and didn’t respect man.
</span> <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C18V3">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">A widow was in that city, and she often came to him, saying, ‘Defend me from my adversary!’
</span> <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C18V4">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">He wouldn’t for a while, but afterward he said to himself, ‘Though I neither fear God, nor respect man,
</span> <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C18V5">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">yet because this widow bothers me, I will defend her, or else she will wear me out by her continual coming.’”</span></div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C18V6">&nbsp;</a>The Lord said,
<span class="wj">“Listen to what the unrighteous judge says.
</span> <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C18V7">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Won’t God avenge his chosen ones, who are crying out to him day and night, and yet he exercises patience
with them?
</span> <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C18V8">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">I tell you that he will avenge them quickly. Nevertheless, when the Son of Man comes, will he find faith
on the earth?”</span></div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C18V9">&nbsp;</a>He spoke also this parable to certain people who were convinced of their own righteousness, and who despised
all others.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C18V10">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">“Two men went up into the temple to pray; one was a Pharisee, and the other was a tax collector.
</span> <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C18V11">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">The Pharisee stood and prayed to himself like this: ‘God, I thank you, that I am not like the rest of
men, extortionists, unrighteous, adulterers, or even like this tax collector.
</span> <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C18V12">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">I fast twice a week. I give tithes of all that I get.’
</span> <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C18V13">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">But the tax collector, standing far away, wouldn’t even lift up his eyes to heaven, but beat his breast,
saying, ‘God, be merciful to me, a sinner!’
</span> <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C18V14">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">I tell you, this man went down to his house justified rather than the other; for everyone who exalts
himself will be humbled, but he who humbles himself will be exalted.”</span></div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C18V15">&nbsp;</a>They were also bringing their babies to him, that he might touch them. But when the disciples saw it,
they rebuked them.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C18V16">&nbsp;</a>Jesus summoned them, saying,
<span class="wj">“Allow the little children to come to me, and don’t hinder them, for God’s Kingdom belongs to such as
these.
</span> <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C18V17">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Most certainly, I tell you, whoever doesn’t receive God’s Kingdom like a little child, he will in no
way enter into it.”</span></div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C18V18">&nbsp;</a>A certain ruler asked him, saying, “Good Teacher, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C18V19">&nbsp;</a>Jesus asked him,
<span class="wj">“Why do you call me good? No one is good, except one—God.
</span> <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C18V20">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">You know the commandments: ‘Don’t commit adultery,’ ‘Don’t murder,’ ‘Don’t steal,’ ‘Don’t give false
testimony,’ ‘Honor your father and your mother.’”</span><a href="#FN1"><span class="notemark"></span><span class="popup">+ Exodus 20:12-16; Deuteronomy 5:16-20</span></a>
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C18V21">&nbsp;</a>He said, “I have observed all these things from my youth up.”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C18V22">&nbsp;</a>When Jesus heard these things, he said to him,
<span class="wj">“You still lack one thing. Sell all that you have, and distribute it to the poor. You will have treasure
in heaven. Come, follow me.”</span></div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C18V23">&nbsp;</a>But when he heard these things, he became very sad, for he was very rich.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C18V24">&nbsp;</a>Jesus, seeing that he became very sad, said,
<span class="wj">“How hard it is for those who have riches to enter into God’s Kingdom!
</span> <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C18V25">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">For it is easier for a camel to enter in through a needle’s eye, than for a rich man to enter into God’s
Kingdom.”</span></div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C18V26">&nbsp;</a>Those who heard it said, “Then who can be saved?”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C18V27">&nbsp;</a>But he said,
<span class="wj">“The things which are impossible with men are possible with God.”</span></div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C18V28">&nbsp;</a>Peter said, “Look, we have left everything, and followed you.”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C18V29">&nbsp;</a>He said to them,
<span class="wj">“Most certainly I tell you, there is no one who has left house, or wife, or brothers, or parents, or
children, for God’s Kingdom’s sake,
</span> <span class="verse"> 30</span><a name="C18V30">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">who will not receive many times more in this time, and in the world to come, eternal life.”</span></div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 31</span><a name="C18V31">&nbsp;</a>He took the twelve aside, and said to them,
<span class="wj">“Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem, and all the things that are written through the prophets concerning
the Son of Man will be completed.
</span> <span class="verse"> 32</span><a name="C18V32">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">For he will be delivered up to the Gentiles, will be mocked, treated shamefully, and spit on.
</span> <span class="verse"> 33</span><a name="C18V33">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">They will scourge and kill him. On the third day, he will rise again.”</span></div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 34</span><a name="C18V34">&nbsp;</a>They understood none of these things. This saying was hidden from them, and they didn’t understand the
things that were said.
 <span class="verse"> 35</span><a name="C18V35">&nbsp;</a>As he came near Jericho, a certain blind man sat by the road, begging.
 <span class="verse"> 36</span><a name="C18V36">&nbsp;</a>Hearing a multitude going by, he asked what this meant.
 <span class="verse"> 37</span><a name="C18V37">&nbsp;</a>They told him that Jesus of Nazareth was passing by.
 <span class="verse"> 38</span><a name="C18V38">&nbsp;</a>He cried out, “Jesus, you son of David, have mercy on me!”
 <span class="verse"> 39</span><a name="C18V39">&nbsp;</a>Those who led the way rebuked him, that he should be quiet; but he cried out all the more, “You son of
David, have mercy on me!”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 40</span><a name="C18V40">&nbsp;</a>Standing still, Jesus commanded him to be brought to him. When he had come near, he asked him,
 <span class="verse"> 41</span><a name="C18V41">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">“What do you want me to do?”</span></div>
<div class="p">He said, “Lord, that I may see again.”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 42</span><a name="C18V42">&nbsp;</a>Jesus said to him,
<span class="wj">“Receive your sight. Your faith has healed you.”
</span></div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 43</span><a name="C18V43">&nbsp;</a>Immediately he received his sight, and followed him, glorifying God. All the people, when they saw it,
praised God.
