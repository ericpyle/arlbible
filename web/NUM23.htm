 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C23V1">&nbsp;</a>Balaam said to Balak, “Build here seven altars for me, and prepare here seven bulls and seven rams for
me.”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C23V2">&nbsp;</a>Balak did as Balaam had spoken; and Balak and Balaam offered on every altar a bull and a ram.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C23V3">&nbsp;</a>Balaam said to Balak, “Stand by your burnt offering, and I will go. Perhaps Yahweh will come to meet
me. Whatever he shows me I will tell you.”
</div>
<div class="p">He went to a bare height.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C23V4">&nbsp;</a>God met Balaam, and he said to him, “I have prepared the seven altars, and I have offered up a bull and
a ram on every altar.”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C23V5">&nbsp;</a>Yahweh put a word in Balaam’s mouth, and said, “Return to Balak, and thus you shall speak.”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C23V6">&nbsp;</a>He returned to him, and behold, he was standing by his burnt offering, he, and all the princes of Moab.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C23V7">&nbsp;</a>He took up his parable, and said,
</div>
<div class="q1">“From Aram has Balak brought me,
</div>
<div class="q2">the king of Moab from the mountains of the East.
</div>
<div class="q1">Come, curse Jacob for me.
</div>
<div class="q2">Come, defy Israel.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C23V8">&nbsp;</a>How shall I curse whom God has not cursed?
</div>
<div class="q2">How shall I defy whom Yahweh has not defied?
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C23V9">&nbsp;</a>For from the top of the rocks I see him.
</div>
<div class="q2">From the hills I see him.
</div>
<div class="q1">Behold, it is a people that dwells alone,
</div>
<div class="q2">and shall not be listed among the nations.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C23V10">&nbsp;</a>Who can count the dust of Jacob,
</div>
<div class="q2">or count the fourth part of Israel?
</div>
<div class="q1">Let me die the death of the righteous!
</div>
<div class="q2">Let my last end be like his!”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C23V11">&nbsp;</a>Balak said to Balaam, “What have you done to me? I took you to curse my enemies, and behold, you have
blessed them altogether.”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C23V12">&nbsp;</a>He answered and said, “Must I not take heed to speak that which Yahweh puts in my mouth?”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C23V13">&nbsp;</a>Balak said to him, “Please come with me to another place, where you may see them. You shall see just
part of them, and shall not see them all. Curse them from there for me.”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C23V14">&nbsp;</a>He took him into the field of Zophim, to the top of Pisgah, and built seven altars, and offered up a
bull and a ram on every altar.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C23V15">&nbsp;</a>He said to Balak, “Stand here by your burnt offering, while I meet over there.”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C23V16">&nbsp;</a>Yahweh met Balaam, and put a word in his mouth, and said, “Return to Balak, and say this.”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C23V17">&nbsp;</a>He came to him, and behold, he was standing by his burnt offering, and the princes of Moab with him.
Balak said to him, “What has Yahweh spoken?”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C23V18">&nbsp;</a>He took up his parable, and said,
</div>
<div class="q1">“Rise up, Balak, and hear!
</div>
<div class="q2">Listen to me, you son of Zippor.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C23V19">&nbsp;</a>God is not a man, that he should lie,
</div>
<div class="q2">nor the son of man, that he should repent.
</div>
<div class="q1">Has he said, and will he not do it?
</div>
<div class="q2">Or has he spoken, and will he not make it good?
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C23V20">&nbsp;</a>Behold, I have received a command to bless.
</div>
<div class="q2">He has blessed, and I can’t reverse it.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C23V21">&nbsp;</a>He has not seen iniquity in Jacob.
</div>
<div class="q2">Neither has he seen perverseness in Israel.
</div>
<div class="q1">Yahweh his God is with him.
</div>
<div class="q2">The shout of a king is among them.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C23V22">&nbsp;</a>God brings them out of Egypt.
</div>
<div class="q2">He has as it were the strength of the wild ox.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C23V23">&nbsp;</a>Surely there is no enchantment with Jacob;
</div>
<div class="q2">Neither is there any divination with Israel.
</div>
<div class="q1">Now it shall be said of Jacob and of Israel,
</div>
<div class="q2">‘What has God done!’
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C23V24">&nbsp;</a>Behold, the people rises up as a lioness.
</div>
<div class="q2">As a lion he lifts himself up.
</div>
<div class="q1">He shall not lie down until he eats of the prey,
</div>
<div class="q2">and drinks the blood of the slain.”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C23V25">&nbsp;</a>Balak said to Balaam, “Neither curse them at all, nor bless them at all.”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C23V26">&nbsp;</a>But Balaam answered Balak, “Didn’t I tell you, saying, ‘All that Yahweh speaks, that I must do?’”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C23V27">&nbsp;</a>Balak said to Balaam, “Come now, I will take you to another place; perhaps it will please God that you
may curse them for me from there.”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C23V28">&nbsp;</a>Balak took Balaam to the top of Peor, that looks down on the desert.
 <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C23V29">&nbsp;</a>Balaam said to Balak, “Build seven altars for me here, and prepare seven bulls and seven rams for me
here.”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 30</span><a name="C23V30">&nbsp;</a>Balak did as Balaam had said, and offered up a bull and a ram on every altar.
