<div class="chapterlabel"> 13</div><div class="p">
 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C13V1">&nbsp;</a>Yahweh said to me, “Go, and buy yourself a linen belt, and put it on your waist, and don’t put it in
water.”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C13V2">&nbsp;</a>So I bought a belt according to Yahweh’s word, and put it on my waist.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C13V3">&nbsp;</a>Yahweh’s word came to me the second time, saying,
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C13V4">&nbsp;</a>“Take the belt that you have bought, which is on your waist, and arise, go to the Euphrates, and hide
it there in a cleft of the rock.”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C13V5">&nbsp;</a>So I went, and hid it by the Euphrates, as Yahweh commanded me.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C13V6">&nbsp;</a>After many days, Yahweh said to me, “Arise, go to the Euphrates, and take the belt from there, which
I commanded you to hide there.”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C13V7">&nbsp;</a>Then I went to the Euphrates, and dug, and took the belt from the place where I had hidden it; and behold,
the belt was ruined. It was profitable for nothing.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C13V8">&nbsp;</a>Then Yahweh’s word came to me, saying,
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C13V9">&nbsp;</a>“Yahweh says, ‘In this way I, will ruin the pride of Judah, and the great pride of Jerusalem.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C13V10">&nbsp;</a>This evil people, who refuse to hear my words, who walk in the stubbornness of their heart, and have
gone after other gods to serve them, and to worship them, will even be as this belt, which is profitable
for nothing.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C13V11">&nbsp;</a>For as the belt clings to the waist of a man, so I have caused the whole house of Israel and the whole
house of Judah to cling to me,’ says Yahweh; ‘that they may be to me for a people, for a name, for praise,
and for glory; but they would not hear.’
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C13V12">&nbsp;</a>“Therefore you shall speak to them this word: ‘Yahweh, the God of Israel says, “Every bottle should be
filled with wine.”’ They will tell you, ‘Do we not certainly know that every bottle should be filled
with wine?’
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C13V13">&nbsp;</a>Then tell them, ‘Yahweh says, “Behold, I will fill all the inhabitants of this land, even the kings who
sit on David’s throne, the priests, the prophets, and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, with drunkenness.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C13V14">&nbsp;</a>I will dash them one against another, even the fathers and the sons together,” says Yahweh: “I will not
pity, spare, or have compassion, that I should not destroy them.”’”
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C13V15">&nbsp;</a>Hear, and give ear.
</div>
<div class="q2">Don’t be proud,
</div>
<div class="q2">for Yahweh has spoken.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C13V16">&nbsp;</a>Give glory to Yahweh your God,
</div>
<div class="q2">before he causes darkness,
</div>
<div class="q2">and before your feet stumble on the dark mountains,
</div>
<div class="q1">and, while you look for light,
</div>
<div class="q2">he turns it into the shadow of death,
</div>
<div class="q2">and makes it deep darkness.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C13V17">&nbsp;</a>But if you will not hear it,
</div>
<div class="q2">my soul will weep in secret for your pride.
</div>
<div class="q1">My eye will weep bitterly,
</div>
<div class="q2">and run down with tears,
</div>
<div class="q2">because Yahweh’s flock has been taken captive.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C13V18">&nbsp;</a>Say to the king and to the queen mother,
</div>
<div class="q2">“Humble yourselves.
</div>
<div class="q1">Sit down, for your crowns have come down,
</div>
<div class="q2">even the crown of your glory.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C13V19">&nbsp;</a>The cities of the South is shut up,
</div>
<div class="q2">and there is no one to open them.
</div>
<div class="q1">Judah is carried away captive: all of it.
</div>
<div class="q2">It is wholly carried away captive.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C13V20">&nbsp;</a>Lift up your eyes,
</div>
<div class="q2">and see those who come from the north.
</div>
<div class="q1">Where is the flock that was given to you,
</div>
<div class="q2">your beautiful flock?
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C13V21">&nbsp;</a>What will you say, when he sets over you as head those whom you have yourself taught to be friends to
you?
</div>
<div class="q2">Won’t sorrows take hold of you, as of a woman in travail?
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C13V22">&nbsp;</a>If you say in your heart,
</div>
<div class="q2">“Why have these things come on me?”
</div>
<div class="q1">Your skirts are uncovered because of the greatness of your iniquity,
</div>
<div class="q2">and your heels suffer violence.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C13V23">&nbsp;</a>Can the Ethiopian change his skin,
</div>
<div class="q2">or the leopard his spots?
</div>
<div class="q1">Then may you also do good,
</div>
<div class="q2">who are accustomed to do evil.
</div>
<div class="b"></div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C13V24">&nbsp;</a>“Therefore I will scatter them,
</div>
<div class="q2">as the stubble that passes away,
</div>
<div class="q2">by the wind of the wilderness.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C13V25">&nbsp;</a>This is your lot,
</div>
<div class="q2">the portion measured to you from me,” says Yahweh,
</div>
<div class="q1">“because you have forgotten me,
</div>
<div class="q2">and trusted in falsehood.”
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C13V26">&nbsp;</a>Therefore will I also uncover your skirts on your face,
</div>
<div class="q2">and your shame will appear.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C13V27">&nbsp;</a>I have seen your abominations, even your adulteries,
</div>
<div class="q2">and your neighing, the lewdness of your prostitution,
</div>
<div class="q2">on the hills in the field.
</div>
<div class="q1">Woe to you, Jerusalem!
</div>
<div class="q2">You will not be made clean.
</div>
<div class="q2">How long will it yet be?”
