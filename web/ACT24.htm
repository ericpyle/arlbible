 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C24V1">&nbsp;</a>After five days, the high priest, Ananias, came down with certain elders and an orator, one Tertullus.
They informed the governor against Paul.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C24V2">&nbsp;</a>When he was called, Tertullus began to accuse him, saying, “Seeing that by you we enjoy much peace, and
that prosperity is coming to this nation by your foresight,
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C24V3">&nbsp;</a>we accept it in all ways and in all places, most excellent Felix, with all thankfulness.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C24V4">&nbsp;</a>But, that I don’t delay you, I entreat you to bear with us and hear a few words.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C24V5">&nbsp;</a>For we have found this man to be a plague, an instigator of insurrections among all the Jews throughout
the world, and a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C24V6">&nbsp;</a>He even tried to profane the temple, and we arrested him.<a href="#FN1"><span class="notemark">*</span><span class="popup">TR adds “We wanted to judge him according to our law,”</span></a>
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C24V7">&nbsp;</a><a href="#FN2"><span class="notemark">†</span><span class="popup">TR adds “but the commanding officer, Lysias, came by and with great violence took him out of our hands,”</span></a>
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C24V8">&nbsp;</a><a href="#FN3"><span class="notemark">‡</span><span class="popup">TR adds “commanding his accusers to come to you.”</span></a>
By examining him yourself you may ascertain all these things of which we accuse him.”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C24V9">&nbsp;</a>The Jews also joined in the attack, affirming that these things were so.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C24V10">&nbsp;</a>When the governor had beckoned to him to speak, Paul answered, “Because I know that you have been a judge
of this nation for many years, I cheerfully make my defense,
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C24V11">&nbsp;</a>seeing that you can recognize that it is not more than twelve days since I went up to worship at Jerusalem.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C24V12">&nbsp;</a>In the temple they didn’t find me disputing with anyone or stirring up a crowd, either in the synagogues,
or in the city.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C24V13">&nbsp;</a>Nor can they prove to you the things of which they now accuse me.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C24V14">&nbsp;</a>But this I confess to you, that after the Way, which they call a sect, so I serve the God of our fathers,
believing all things which are according to the law, and which are written in the prophets;
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C24V15">&nbsp;</a>having hope toward God, which these also themselves look for, that there will be a resurrection of the
dead, both of the just and unjust.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C24V16">&nbsp;</a>Herein I also practice always having a conscience void of offense toward God and men.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C24V17">&nbsp;</a>Now after some years, I came to bring gifts for the needy to my nation, and offerings;
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C24V18">&nbsp;</a>amid which certain Jews from Asia found me purified in the temple, not with a mob, nor with turmoil.
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C24V19">&nbsp;</a>They ought to have been here before you, and to make accusation, if they had anything against me.
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C24V20">&nbsp;</a>Or else let these men themselves say what injustice they found in me when I stood before the council,
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C24V21">&nbsp;</a>unless it is for this one thing that I cried standing among them, ‘Concerning the resurrection of the
dead I am being judged before you today!’”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C24V22">&nbsp;</a>But Felix, having more exact knowledge concerning the Way, deferred them, saying, “When Lysias, the commanding
officer, comes down, I will decide your case.”
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C24V23">&nbsp;</a>He ordered the centurion that Paul should be kept in custody, and should have some privileges, and not
to forbid any of his friends to serve him or to visit him.
 <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C24V24">&nbsp;</a>But after some days, Felix came with Drusilla, his wife, who was a Jewess, and sent for Paul, and heard
him concerning the faith in Christ Jesus.
 <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C24V25">&nbsp;</a>As he reasoned about righteousness, self-control, and the judgment to come, Felix was terrified, and
answered, “Go your way for this time, and when it is convenient for me, I will summon you.”
 <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C24V26">&nbsp;</a>Meanwhile, he also hoped that money would be given to him by Paul, that he might release him. Therefore
also he sent for him more often, and talked with him.
 <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C24V27">&nbsp;</a>But when two years were fulfilled, Felix was succeeded by Porcius Festus, and desiring to gain favor
with the Jews, Felix left Paul in bonds.
