 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C10V1">&nbsp;</a>Now this one, having endured this praiseworthy death, the third was brought along, and exhorted by many
to taste and save his life.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C10V2">&nbsp;</a>But he cried out and said, Know you⌃ not, that the father of those who are dead, became the father of
me also; and that the same mother bare me; and that I was brought up in the same tenets?
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C10V3">&nbsp;</a>I abjure not the noble relationship of my brethren.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C10V4">&nbsp;</a>Now then, whatever instrument of vengeance you⌃ have, apply it to my body, for you⌃ are not able to touch,
even if you⌃ wish it, my soul.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C10V5">&nbsp;</a>But they, highly incensed at his boldness of speech, dislocated his hands and feet with racking engines,
and wrenching them from their sockets, dismembered him.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C10V6">&nbsp;</a>And they dragged round his fingers, and his arms, and his legs, and his ankles.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C10V7">&nbsp;</a>And not being able by any means to strangle him, they tore off his skin, together with the extreme tips
of his fingers, flayed him, and then haled him to the wheel;
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C10V8">&nbsp;</a>around which his vertebral joints were loosened, and he saw his own flesh torn to shreds, and streams
of blood flowing from his entrails.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C10V9">&nbsp;</a>And when about to die, he said,
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C10V10">&nbsp;</a>We, O accursed tyrant, suffer this for the sake of Divine education and virtue.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C10V11">&nbsp;</a>But you, for your impiety and blood shedding, shall endure indissoluble torments.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C10V12">&nbsp;</a>And thus having died worthily of his brethren, they dragged forward the fourth, saying,
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C10V13">&nbsp;</a>Do not you share the madness of your brethren: but give regard to the king, and save yourself.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C10V14">&nbsp;</a>But he said to them, You have not a fire so scorching as to make me play the coward.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C10V15">&nbsp;</a>By the blessed death of my brethren, and the eternal punishment of the tyrant, and the glorious life
of the pious, I will not repudiate the noble brotherhood.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C10V16">&nbsp;</a>Invent, O tyrant, tortures; that you may learn, even through them, that I am the brother of those tormented
before.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C10V17">&nbsp;</a>When he had said this, the blood-thirsty, and murderous, and unhallowed Antiochus ordered his tongue
to be cut out.
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C10V18">&nbsp;</a>But he said, Even if you take away the organ of speech, yet God hears the silent.
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C10V19">&nbsp;</a>Behold, my tongue is extended, cut it off; for not for that halt you extirpate our reasoning.
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C10V20">&nbsp;</a>Gladly do we lose our limbs in behalf of God.
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C10V21">&nbsp;</a>But God shall speedly find you, since you cut off the tongue, the instrument of divine melody.
