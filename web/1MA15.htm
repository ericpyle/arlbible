 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C15V3">&nbsp;</a>Forasmuch as certain pestilent fellows have made themselves masters of the kingdom of our fathers, but
my purpose is to claim the kingdom, that I may restore it as it was before; and moreover I have raised
a multitude of foreign soldiers, and have prepared ships of war;
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C15V4">&nbsp;</a>moreover I am minded to land in the country, that I may punish them that have destroyed our country,
and them that have made many cities in the kingdom desolate:
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C15V5">&nbsp;</a>Now therefore I confirm to you all the exactions which the kings that were before me remitted to you,
and whatever gifts besides they remitted to you:
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C15V6">&nbsp;</a>and I give you leave to coin money for your country with your own stamp,
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C15V7">&nbsp;</a>but that Jerusalem and the sanctuary should be free: and all the arms that you have prepared, and the
strongholds that you have built, which you have in your possession, let them remain to you:
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C15V8">&nbsp;</a>and everything owing to the king, and the things that shall be owing to the king from henceforth and
for evermore, let them be remitted to you:
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C15V9">&nbsp;</a>moreover, when we shall have established our kingdom, we will glorify you and your nation and the temple
with great glory, so that your glory shall be made manifest in all the earth.

 he came, as he fled, to Dor, which is by the sea:
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C15V12">&nbsp;</a>for he knew that troubles were come upon him all at once, and that his forces had forsaken him.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C15V13">&nbsp;</a>And Antiochus encamped against Dor, and with him a hundred and twenty thousand men of war, and eight

the city by land and sea, and suffered no man to go out or in.

being sent from Simon the high priest, and from the people of the Jews:
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C15V18">&nbsp;</a>moreover they brought a shield of gold of a thousand pound.
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C15V19">&nbsp;</a>It pleased us therefore to write to the kings and to the countries, that they should not seek their hurt,
nor fight against them, and their cities, and their country, nor be confederates with such as fight against
them.
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C15V20">&nbsp;</a>Moreover it seemed good to us to receive the shield of them.

 Friend came to Jerusalem; and he saw the glory of Simon, and the cupboard of gold and silver vessels,
and his great attendance, and he was amazed; and he reported to him the king’s words.
 <span class="verse"> 33</span><a name="C15V33">&nbsp;</a>And Simon answered, and said to him,
</div>
<div class="p">We have neither taken other men’s land, nor have we possession of that which appertains to others, but
of the inheritance of our fathers; howbeit, it was had in possession of our enemies wrongfully for a
certain time.

 <span class="verse"> 35</span><a name="C15V35">&nbsp;</a>But as touching Joppa and Gazara, which you demand, they did great harm among the people throughout our
country, we will give a hundred talents for them.
</div>
<div class="p">And he answered him not a word,
 <span class="verse"> 36</span><a name="C15V36">&nbsp;</a>but returned in a rage to the king, and reported to him these words, and the glory of Simon, and all
that he had seen: and the king was exceeding angry.
 <span class="verse"> 37</span><a name="C15V37">&nbsp;</a>But Tryphon embarked on board a ship, and fled to Orthosia.

<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 38</span><a name="C15V38">&nbsp;</a>And the king appointed Cendebaeus chief captain of the sea coast, and gave him forces of foot and horse:
 <span class="verse"> 39</span><a name="C15V39">&nbsp;</a>and he commanded him to encamp before Judaea, and he commanded him to build up Kidron, and to fortify
the gates, and that he should fight against the people: but the king pursued Tryphon.
 <span class="verse"> 40</span><a name="C15V40">&nbsp;</a>And Cendebaeus came to Jamnia, and began to provoke the people, and to invade Judaea, and to take the
people captive, and to kill them.
 <span class="verse"> 41</span><a name="C15V41">&nbsp;</a>And he built Kidron, and set horsemen there, and forces of foot, to the end that issuing out they might
make outroads upon the ways of Judaea, according as the king commanded him.
