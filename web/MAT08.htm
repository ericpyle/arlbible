 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C8V1">&nbsp;</a>When he came down from the mountain, great multitudes followed him.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C8V2">&nbsp;</a>Behold, a leper came to him and worshiped him, saying, “Lord, if you want to, you can make me clean.”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C8V3">&nbsp;</a>Jesus stretched out his hand, and touched him, saying,
<span class="wj">“I want to. Be made clean.”</span> Immediately his leprosy was cleansed.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C8V4">&nbsp;</a>Jesus said to him,
<span class="wj">“See that you tell nobody, but go, show yourself to the priest, and offer the gift that Moses commanded,
as a testimony to them.”</span></div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C8V5">&nbsp;</a>When he came into Capernaum, a centurion came to him, asking him,
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C8V6">&nbsp;</a>and saying, “Lord, my servant lies in the house paralyzed, grievously tormented.”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C8V7">&nbsp;</a>Jesus said to him,
<span class="wj">“I will come and heal him.”</span></div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C8V8">&nbsp;</a>The centurion answered, “Lord, I’m not worthy for you to come under my roof. Just say the word, and my
servant will be healed.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C8V9">&nbsp;</a>For I am also a man under authority, having under myself soldiers. I tell this one, ‘Go,’ and he goes;
and tell another, ‘Come,’ and he comes; and tell my servant, ‘Do this,’ and he does it.”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C8V10">&nbsp;</a>When Jesus heard it, he marveled, and said to those who followed,
<span class="wj">“Most certainly I tell you, I haven’t found so great a faith, not even in Israel.
</span> <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C8V11">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">I tell you that many will come from the east and the west, and will sit down with Abraham, Isaac, and
Jacob in the Kingdom of Heaven,
</span> <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C8V12">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">but the children of the Kingdom will be thrown out into the outer darkness. There will be weeping and
gnashing of teeth.”</span> <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C8V13">&nbsp;</a>Jesus said to the centurion,
<span class="wj">“Go your way. Let it be done for you as you have believed.”</span> His servant was healed in that hour.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C8V14">&nbsp;</a>When Jesus came into Peter’s house, he saw his wife’s mother lying sick with a fever.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C8V15">&nbsp;</a>He touched her hand, and the fever left her. She got up and served him.

 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C8V16">&nbsp;</a>When evening came, they brought to him many possessed with demons. He cast out the spirits with a word,
and healed all who were sick;
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C8V17">&nbsp;</a>that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through Isaiah the prophet, saying, “He took our infirmities,
and bore our diseases.”<a href="#FN2"><span class="notemark"></span><span class="popup">+ Isaiah 53:4
</span></a>
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C8V18">&nbsp;</a>Now when Jesus saw great multitudes around him, he gave the order to depart to the other side.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C8V19">&nbsp;</a>A scribe came, and said to him, “Teacher, I will follow you wherever you go.”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C8V20">&nbsp;</a>Jesus said to him,
<span class="wj">“The foxes have holes, and the birds of the sky have nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his
head.”</span></div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C8V21">&nbsp;</a>Another of his disciples said to him, “Lord, allow me first to go and bury my father.”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C8V22">&nbsp;</a>But Jesus said to him,
<span class="wj">“Follow me, and leave the dead to bury their own dead.”</span></div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C8V23">&nbsp;</a>When he got into a boat, his disciples followed him.
 <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C8V24">&nbsp;</a>Behold, a violent storm came up on the sea, so much that the boat was covered with the waves, but he
was asleep.
 <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C8V25">&nbsp;</a>They came to him, and woke him up, saying, “Save us, Lord! We are dying!”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C8V26">&nbsp;</a>He said to them,
<span class="wj">“Why are you fearful, O you of little faith?”
</span> Then he got up, rebuked the wind and the sea, and there was a great calm.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C8V27">&nbsp;</a>The men marveled, saying, “What kind of man is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him?”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C8V28">&nbsp;</a>When he came to the other side, into the country of the Gergesenes,
<a href="#FN3"><span class="notemark">†</span><span class="popup">NU reads “Gadarenes”</span></a>
 two people possessed by demons met him there, coming out of the tombs, exceedingly fierce, so that nobody
could pass that way.
 <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C8V29">&nbsp;</a>Behold, they cried out, saying, “What do we have to do with you, Jesus, Son of God? Have you come here
to torment us before the time?”
 <span class="verse"> 30</span><a name="C8V30">&nbsp;</a>Now there was a herd of many pigs feeding far away from them.
 <span class="verse"> 31</span><a name="C8V31">&nbsp;</a>The demons begged him, saying, “If you cast us out, permit us to go away into the herd of pigs.”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 32</span><a name="C8V32">&nbsp;</a>He said to them,
<span class="wj">“Go!”</span></div>
<div class="p">They came out, and went into the herd of pigs: and behold, the whole herd of pigs rushed down the cliff
into the sea, and died in the water.
 <span class="verse"> 33</span><a name="C8V33">&nbsp;</a>Those who fed them fled, and went away into the city, and told everything, including what happened to
those who were possessed with demons.
 <span class="verse"> 34</span><a name="C8V34">&nbsp;</a>Behold, all the city came out to meet Jesus. When they saw him, they begged that he would depart from
their borders.
