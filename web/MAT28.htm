 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C28V1">&nbsp;</a>Now after the Sabbath, as it began to dawn on the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene and the other
Mary came to see the tomb.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C28V2">&nbsp;</a>Behold, there was a great earthquake, for an angel of the Lord descended from the sky, and came and rolled
away the stone from the door, and sat on it.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C28V3">&nbsp;</a>His appearance was like lightning, and his clothing white as snow.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C28V4">&nbsp;</a>For fear of him, the guards shook, and became like dead men.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C28V5">&nbsp;</a>The angel answered the women, “Don’t be afraid, for I know that you seek Jesus, who has been crucified.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C28V6">&nbsp;</a>He is not here, for he has risen, just like he said. Come, see the place where the Lord was lying.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C28V7">&nbsp;</a>Go quickly and tell his disciples, ‘He has risen from the dead, and behold, he goes before you into Galilee;
there you will see him.’ Behold, I have told you.”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C28V8">&nbsp;</a>They departed quickly from the tomb with fear and great joy, and ran to bring his disciples word.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C28V9">&nbsp;</a>As they went to tell his disciples, behold, Jesus met them, saying,
<span class="wj">“Rejoice!”</span></div>
<div class="p">They came and took hold of his feet, and worshiped him.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C28V10">&nbsp;</a>Then Jesus said to them,
<span class="wj">“Don’t be afraid. Go tell my brothers
</span><a href="#FN1"><span class="notemark">*</span><span class="popup">The word for “brothers” here may be also correctly translated “brothers and sisters” or “siblings.”</span></a>
<span class="wj">that they should go into Galilee, and there they will see me.”</span></div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C28V11">&nbsp;</a>Now while they were going, behold, some of the guards came into the city, and told the chief priests
all the things that had happened.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C28V12">&nbsp;</a>When they were assembled with the elders, and had taken counsel, they gave a large amount of silver to
the soldiers,
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C28V13">&nbsp;</a>saying, “Say that his disciples came by night, and stole him away while we slept.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C28V14">&nbsp;</a>If this comes to the governor’s ears, we will persuade him and make you free of worry.”
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C28V15">&nbsp;</a>So they took the money and did as they were told. This saying was spread abroad among the Jews, and continues
until today.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C28V16">&nbsp;</a>But the eleven disciples went into Galilee, to the mountain where Jesus had sent them.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C28V17">&nbsp;</a>When they saw him, they bowed down to him, but some doubted.
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C28V18">&nbsp;</a>Jesus came to them and spoke to them, saying,
<span class="wj">“All authority has been given to me in heaven and on earth.
</span> <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C28V19">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Go,</span><a href="#FN2"><span class="notemark">†</span><span class="popup">TR and NU add “therefore”</span></a>
<span class="wj">and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the
Holy Spirit,
</span> <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C28V20">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">teaching them to observe all things that I commanded you. Behold, I am with you always, even to the end
of the age.”</span> Amen.
