 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C3V1">&nbsp;</a>Woe to her who is rebellious and polluted, the oppressing city!
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C3V2">&nbsp;</a>She didn’t obey the voice. She didn’t receive correction. She didn’t trust in Yahweh. She didn’t draw
near to her God.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C3V3">&nbsp;</a>Her princes within her are roaring lions. Her judges are evening wolves. They leave nothing until the
next day.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C3V4">&nbsp;</a>Her prophets are arrogant and treacherous people. Her priests have profaned the sanctuary. They have
done violence to the law.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C3V5">&nbsp;</a>Yahweh, within her, is righteous. He will do no wrong. Every morning he brings his justice to light.
He doesn’t fail, but the unjust know no shame.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C3V6">&nbsp;</a>I have cut off nations. Their battlements are desolate. I have made their streets waste, so that no one
passes by. Their cities are destroyed, so that there is no man, so that there is no inhabitant.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C3V7">&nbsp;</a>I said, “Just fear me. Receive correction, so that her dwelling won’t be cut off, according to all that
I have appointed concerning her.” But they rose early and corrupted all their doings.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C3V8">&nbsp;</a>“Therefore wait for me”, says Yahweh, “until the day that I rise up to the prey, for my determination
is to gather the nations, that I may assemble the kingdoms, to pour on them my indignation, even all
my fierce anger, for all the earth will be devoured with the fire of my jealousy.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C3V9">&nbsp;</a>For then I will purify the lips of the peoples, that they may all call on Yahweh’s name, to serve him
shoulder to shoulder.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C3V10">&nbsp;</a>From beyond the rivers of Cush, my worshipers, even the daughter of my dispersed people, will bring my
offering.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C3V11">&nbsp;</a>In that day you will not be disappointed for all your doings, in which you have transgressed against
me; for then I will take away out from among you your proudly exulting ones, and you will no more be
haughty in my holy mountain.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C3V12">&nbsp;</a>But I will leave among you an afflicted and poor people, and they will take refuge in Yahweh’s name.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C3V13">&nbsp;</a>The remnant of Israel will not do iniquity, nor speak lies, neither will a deceitful tongue be found
in their mouth, for they will feed and lie down, and no one will make them afraid.”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C3V14">&nbsp;</a>Sing, daughter of Zion! Shout, Israel! Be glad and rejoice with all your heart, daughter of Jerusalem.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C3V15">&nbsp;</a>Yahweh has taken away your judgments. He has thrown out your enemy. The King of Israel, Yahweh, is among
you. You will not be afraid of evil any more.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C3V16">&nbsp;</a>In that day, it will be said to Jerusalem, “Don’t be afraid, Zion. Don’t let your hands be weak.”
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C3V17">&nbsp;</a>Yahweh, your God, is among you, a mighty one who will save. He will rejoice over you with joy. He will
calm you in his love. He will rejoice over you with singing.
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C3V18">&nbsp;</a>I will remove those who grieve about the appointed feasts from you. They are a burden and a reproach
to you.
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C3V19">&nbsp;</a>Behold,<a href="#FN1"><span class="notemark">*</span><span class="popup">“Behold”, from “הִנֵּה”, means look at, take notice, observe, see, or gaze at. It is often used as an
interjection.</span></a>
 at that time I will deal with all those who afflict you, and I will save those who are lame, and gather
those who were driven away. I will give them praise and honor, whose shame has been in all the earth.
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C3V20">&nbsp;</a>At that time will I bring you in, and at that time will I gather you; for I will give you honor and praise
among all the peoples of the earth, when I restore your fortunes before your eyes, says Yahweh.
