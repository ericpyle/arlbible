 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C12V1">&nbsp;</a>It is doubtless not profitable for me to boast. For I will come to visions and revelations of the Lord.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C12V2">&nbsp;</a>I know a man in Christ, fourteen years ago (whether in the body, I don’t know, or whether out of the
body, I don’t know; God knows), such a one caught up into the third heaven.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C12V3">&nbsp;</a>I know such a man (whether in the body, or outside of the body, I don’t know; God knows),
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C12V4">&nbsp;</a>how he was caught up into Paradise, and heard unspeakable words, which it is not lawful for a man to
utter.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C12V5">&nbsp;</a>On behalf of such a one I will boast, but on my own behalf I will not boast, except in my weaknesses.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C12V6">&nbsp;</a>For if I would desire to boast, I will not be foolish; for I will speak the truth. But I refrain, so
that no man may think more of me than that which he sees in me, or hears from me.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C12V7">&nbsp;</a>By reason of the exceeding greatness of the revelations, that I should not be exalted excessively, there
was given to me a thorn in the flesh, a messenger of Satan to torment me, that I should not be exalted
excessively.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C12V8">&nbsp;</a>Concerning this thing, I begged the Lord three times that it might depart from me.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C12V9">&nbsp;</a>He has said to me,
<span class="wj">“My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness.”</span> Most gladly therefore I will rather glory in my weaknesses, that the power of Christ may rest on me.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C12V10">&nbsp;</a>Therefore I take pleasure in weaknesses, in injuries, in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses,
for Christ’s sake. For when I am weak, then am I strong.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C12V11">&nbsp;</a>I have become foolish in boasting. You compelled me, for I ought to have been commended by you, for in
nothing was I inferior to the very best apostles, though I am nothing.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C12V12">&nbsp;</a>Truly the signs of an apostle were worked among you in all perseverance, in signs and wonders and mighty
works.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C12V13">&nbsp;</a>For what is there in which you were made inferior to the rest of the assemblies, unless it is that I
myself was not a burden to you? Forgive me this wrong.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C12V14">&nbsp;</a>Behold, this is the third time I am ready to come to you, and I will not be a burden to you; for I seek
not your possessions, but you. For the children ought not to save up for the parents, but the parents
for the children.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C12V15">&nbsp;</a>I will most gladly spend and be spent for your souls. If I love you more abundantly, am I loved the less?
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C12V16">&nbsp;</a>But be it so, I did not myself burden you. But, being crafty, I caught you with deception.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C12V17">&nbsp;</a>Did I take advantage of you by anyone of them whom I have sent to you?
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C12V18">&nbsp;</a>I exhorted Titus, and I sent the brother with him. Did Titus take any advantage of you? Didn’t we walk
in the same spirit? Didn’t we walk in the same steps?
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C12V19">&nbsp;</a>Again, do you think that we are excusing ourselves to you? In the sight of God we speak in Christ. But
all things, beloved, are for your edifying.
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C12V20">&nbsp;</a>For I am afraid that by any means, when I come, I might find you not the way I want to, and that I might
be found by you as you don’t desire; that by any means there would be strife, jealousy, outbursts of
anger, factions, slander, whisperings, proud thoughts, riots;
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C12V21">&nbsp;</a>that again when I come my God would humble me before you, and I would mourn for many of those who have
sinned before now, and not repented of the uncleanness and sexual immorality and lustfulness which they
committed.
