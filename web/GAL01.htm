<div class="mt1">Paul’s Letter to the Galatians
</div>
<div class="chapterlabel"> 1</div><div class="p">
 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C1V1">&nbsp;</a>Paul, an apostle (not from men, nor through man, but through Jesus Christ, and God the Father, who raised
him from the dead),
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C1V2">&nbsp;</a>and all the brothers<a href="#FN1"><span class="notemark">*</span><span class="popup">The word for “brothers” here and where context allows may also be correctly translated “brothers and
sisters” or “siblings.”
</span></a>
 who are with me, to the assemblies of Galatia:
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C1V3">&nbsp;</a>Grace to you and peace from God the Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ,
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C1V4">&nbsp;</a>who gave himself for our sins, that he might deliver us out of this present evil age, according to the
will of our God and Father—
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C1V5">&nbsp;</a>to whom be the glory forever and ever. Amen.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C1V6">&nbsp;</a>I marvel that you are so quickly deserting him who called you in the grace of Christ to a different “good
news”;
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C1V7">&nbsp;</a>and there isn’t another “good news.” Only there are some who trouble you, and want to pervert the Good
News of Christ.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C1V8">&nbsp;</a>But even though we, or an angel from heaven, should preach to you any “good news” other than that which
we preached to you, let him be cursed.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C1V9">&nbsp;</a>As we have said before, so I now say again: if any man preaches to you any “good news” other than that
which you received, let him be cursed.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C1V10">&nbsp;</a>For am I now seeking the favor of men, or of God? Or am I striving to please men? For if I were still
pleasing men, I wouldn’t be a servant of Christ.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C1V11">&nbsp;</a>But I make known to you, brothers, concerning the Good News which was preached by me, that it is not
according to man.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C1V12">&nbsp;</a>For neither did I receive it from man, nor was I taught it, but it came to me through revelation of Jesus
Christ.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C1V13">&nbsp;</a>For you have heard of my way of living in time past in the Jews’ religion, how that beyond measure I
persecuted the assembly of God, and ravaged it.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C1V14">&nbsp;</a>I advanced in the Jews’ religion beyond many of my own age among my countrymen, being more exceedingly
zealous for the traditions of my fathers.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C1V15">&nbsp;</a>But when it was the good pleasure of God, who separated me from my mother’s womb, and called me through
his grace,
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C1V16">&nbsp;</a>to reveal his Son in me, that I might preach him among the Gentiles, I didn’t immediately confer with
flesh and blood,
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C1V17">&nbsp;</a>nor did I go up to Jerusalem to those who were apostles before me, but I went away into Arabia. Then
I returned to Damascus.
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C1V18">&nbsp;</a>Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to visit Peter, and stayed with him fifteen days.
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C1V19">&nbsp;</a>But of the other apostles I saw no one, except James, the Lord’s brother.
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C1V20">&nbsp;</a>Now about the things which I write to you, behold,<a href="#FN2"><span class="notemark">†</span><span class="popup">“Behold”, from “ἰδοὺ”, means look at, take notice, observe, see, or gaze at. It is often used as an interjection.</span></a>
 before God, I’m not lying.
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C1V21">&nbsp;</a>Then I came to the regions of Syria and Cilicia.
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C1V22">&nbsp;</a>I was still unknown by face to the assemblies of Judea which were in Christ,
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C1V23">&nbsp;</a>but they only heard: “He who once persecuted us now preaches the faith that he once tried to destroy.”
 <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C1V24">&nbsp;</a>And they glorified God in me.
