the vow of a Nazirite, to separate himself to Yahweh,
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C6V3">&nbsp;</a>he shall separate himself from wine and strong drink. He shall drink no vinegar of wine, or vinegar of
fermented drink, neither shall he drink any juice of grapes, nor eat fresh grapes or dried.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C6V4">&nbsp;</a>All the days of his separation he shall eat nothing that is made of the grapevine, from the seeds even
to the skins.

head grow long.

when they die; because his separation to God

Tent of Meeting.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C6V11">&nbsp;</a>The priest shall offer one for a sin offering, and the other for a burnt offering, and make atonement
for him, because he sinned by reason of the dead, and shall make his head holy that same day.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C6V12">&nbsp;</a>He shall separate to Yahweh the days of his separation, and shall bring a male lamb a year old for a
trespass offering; but the former days shall be void, because his separation was defiled.

with oil, and their meal offering, and their drink offerings.

the hair of the head of his separation, and put it on the fire which is under the sacrifice of peace
offerings.

one unleavened wafer, and shall put them on the hands of the Nazirite, after he has shaved the head of
his separation;
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C6V20">&nbsp;</a>and the priest shall wave them for a wave offering before Yahweh. This is holy for the priest, together
with the breast that is waved and the thigh that is offered. After that the Nazirite may drink wine.

separation.’”
