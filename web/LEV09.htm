 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C9V1">&nbsp;</a>On the eighth day, Moses called Aaron and his sons, and the elders of Israel;
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C9V2">&nbsp;</a>and he said to Aaron, “Take a calf from the herd for a sin offering, and a ram for a burnt offering,
without defect, and offer them before Yahweh.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C9V3">&nbsp;</a>You shall speak to the children of Israel, saying, ‘Take a male goat for a sin offering; and a calf and
a lamb, both a year old, without defect, for a burnt offering;
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C9V4">&nbsp;</a>and a bull and a ram for peace offerings, to sacrifice before Yahweh; and a meal offering mixed with
oil: for today Yahweh appears to you.’”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C9V5">&nbsp;</a>They brought what Moses commanded before the Tent of Meeting: and all the congregation came near and
stood before Yahweh.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C9V6">&nbsp;</a>Moses said, “This is the thing which Yahweh commanded that you should do: and Yahweh’s glory shall appear
to you.”
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C9V7">&nbsp;</a>Moses said to Aaron, “Draw near to the altar, and offer your sin offering, and your burnt offering, and
make atonement for yourself, and for the people; and offer the offering of the people, and make atonement
for them; as Yahweh commanded.”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C9V8">&nbsp;</a>So Aaron came near to the altar, and killed the calf of the sin offering, which was for himself.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C9V9">&nbsp;</a>The sons of Aaron presented the blood to him; and he dipped his finger in the blood, and put it on the
horns of the altar, and poured out the blood at the base of the altar:
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C9V10">&nbsp;</a>but the fat, and the kidneys, and the cover from the liver of the sin offering, he burned upon the altar;
as Yahweh commanded Moses.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C9V11">&nbsp;</a>The meat and the skin he burned with fire outside the camp.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C9V12">&nbsp;</a>He killed the burnt offering; and Aaron’s sons delivered the blood to him, and he sprinkled it around
on the altar.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C9V13">&nbsp;</a>They delivered the burnt offering to him, piece by piece, and the head: and he burned them upon the altar.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C9V14">&nbsp;</a>He washed the innards and the legs, and burned them on the burnt offering on the altar.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C9V15">&nbsp;</a>He presented the people’s offering, and took the goat of the sin offering which was for the people, and
killed it, and offered it for sin, like the first.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C9V16">&nbsp;</a>He presented the burnt offering, and offered it according to the ordinance.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C9V17">&nbsp;</a>He presented the meal offering, and filled his hand from there, and burned it upon the altar, besides
the burnt offering of the morning.
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C9V18">&nbsp;</a>He also killed the bull and the ram, the sacrifice of peace offerings, which was for the people: and
Aaron’s sons delivered to him the blood, which he sprinkled around on the altar,
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C9V19">&nbsp;</a>and the fat of the bull and of the ram, the fat tail, and that which covers the innards, and the kidneys,
and the cover of the liver:
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C9V20">&nbsp;</a>and they put the fat upon the breasts, and he burned the fat on the altar:
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C9V21">&nbsp;</a>and the breasts and the right thigh Aaron waved for a wave offering before Yahweh, as Moses commanded.
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C9V22">&nbsp;</a>Aaron lifted up his hands toward the people, and blessed them; and he came down from offering the sin
offering, and the burnt offering, and the peace offerings.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C9V23">&nbsp;</a>Moses and Aaron went into the Tent of Meeting, and came out, and blessed the people: and Yahweh’s glory
appeared to all the people.
 <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C9V24">&nbsp;</a>Fire came out from before Yahweh, and consumed the burnt offering and the fat upon the altar. When all
the people saw it, they shouted, and fell on their faces.
