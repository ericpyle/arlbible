 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C11V1">&nbsp;</a>And when he had died, disfigured in his torments, the fifth leaped forward, and said,
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C11V2">&nbsp;</a>I intend not, O tyrant, to get excused from the torment which is in behalf of virtue.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C11V3">&nbsp;</a>But I have come of mine own accord, that by the death of me, you may owe heavenly vengeance a punishment
for more crimes.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C11V4">&nbsp;</a>O you hater of virtue and of men, what have we done that you thus revel in our blood?
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C11V5">&nbsp;</a>Does it seem evil to you that we worship the Founder of all things, and live according to his surpassing
law?
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C11V6">&nbsp;</a>But this is worthy of honors, not torments;
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C11V7">&nbsp;</a>had you been capable of the higher feelings of men, and possessed the hope of salvation from God.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C11V8">&nbsp;</a>Behold now, being alien from God, you make war against those who are religious toward God.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C11V9">&nbsp;</a>As he said this, the spearbearers bound him, and drew him to the catapelt:
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C11V10">&nbsp;</a>to which binding him at his knees, and fastening them with iron fetters, they bent down his loins upon
the wedge of the wheel; and his body was then dismembered, scorpion-fashion.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C11V11">&nbsp;</a>With his breath thus confined, and his body strangled, he said,
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C11V12">&nbsp;</a>A great favor you bestow upon us, O tyrant, by enabling us to manifest our adherence to the law by means
of nobler sufferings.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C11V13">&nbsp;</a>He also being dead, the sixth, quite a youth, was brought out; and on the tyrant asking him whether he
would eat and be delivered, he said,
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C11V14">&nbsp;</a>I am indeed younger than my brothers, but in understanding I am as old;
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C11V15">&nbsp;</a>for having been born and reared to the same end, we are bound to die also in behalf of the same cause.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C11V16">&nbsp;</a>So that if you⌃ think proper to torment us for not eating the unclean, then torment!
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C11V17">&nbsp;</a>As he said this, they brought him to the wheel.
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C11V18">&nbsp;</a>Extended upon which, with limbs racked and dislocated, he was gradually roasted from beneath.
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C11V19">&nbsp;</a>And having heated sharp spits, they approached them to his back; and having transfixed his sides, they
burned away his entrails.
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C11V20">&nbsp;</a>And he, while tormented, said, O period good and holy, in which, for the sake of religion, we brethren
have been called to the contest of pain, and have not been conquered.
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C11V21">&nbsp;</a>For religious understanding, O tyrant, is unconquered.
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C11V22">&nbsp;</a>Armed with upright virtue, I also shall depart with my brethren.
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C11V23">&nbsp;</a>I, too, bearing with me a great avenger, O deviser of tortures, and enemy of the truly pious.
 <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C11V24">&nbsp;</a>We six youths have destroyed your tyranny.
 <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C11V25">&nbsp;</a>For is not your inability to overrule our reasoning, and to compel us to eat the unclean, your destruction?
 <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C11V26">&nbsp;</a>Your fire is cold to us, your catapelts are painless, and your violence harmless.
 <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C11V27">&nbsp;</a>For the guards not of a tyrant but of a divine law are our defenders: through this we keep our reasoning
unconquered.
