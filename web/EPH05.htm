<div class="chapterlabel"> 5</div><div class="p">
 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C5V1">&nbsp;</a>Be therefore imitators of God, as beloved children.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C5V2">&nbsp;</a>Walk in love, even as Christ also loved you, and gave himself up for us, an offering and a sacrifice
to God for a sweet-smelling fragrance.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C5V3">&nbsp;</a>But sexual immorality, and all uncleanness, or covetousness, let it not even be mentioned among you,
as becomes saints;
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C5V4">&nbsp;</a>nor filthiness, nor foolish talking, nor jesting, which are not appropriate; but rather giving of thanks.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C5V5">&nbsp;</a>Know this for sure, that no sexually immoral person, nor unclean person, nor covetous man, who is an
idolater, has any inheritance in the Kingdom of Christ and God.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C5V6">&nbsp;</a>Let no one deceive you with empty words. For because of these things, the wrath of God comes on the children
of disobedience.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C5V7">&nbsp;</a>Therefore don’t be partakers with them.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C5V8">&nbsp;</a>For you were once darkness, but are now light in the Lord. Walk as children of light,
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C5V9">&nbsp;</a>for the fruit of the Spirit is in all goodness and righteousness and truth,
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C5V10">&nbsp;</a>proving what is well pleasing to the Lord.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C5V11">&nbsp;</a>Have no fellowship with the unfruitful deeds of darkness, but rather even reprove them.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C5V12">&nbsp;</a>For the things which are done by them in secret, it is a shame even to speak of.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C5V13">&nbsp;</a>But all things, when they are reproved, are revealed by the light, for everything that reveals is light.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C5V14">&nbsp;</a>Therefore he says, “Awake, you who sleep, and arise from the dead, and Christ will shine on you.”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C5V15">&nbsp;</a>Therefore watch carefully how you walk, not as unwise, but as wise;
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C5V16">&nbsp;</a>redeeming the time, because the days are evil.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C5V17">&nbsp;</a>Therefore don’t be foolish, but understand what the will of the Lord is.
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C5V18">&nbsp;</a>Don’t be drunken with wine, in which is dissipation, but be filled with the Spirit,
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C5V19">&nbsp;</a>speaking to one another in psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs; singing, and making melody in your heart
to the Lord;
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C5V20">&nbsp;</a>giving thanks always concerning all things in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, to God, even the Father;
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C5V21">&nbsp;</a>subjecting yourselves to one another in the fear of Christ.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C5V22">&nbsp;</a>Wives, be subject to your own husbands, as to the Lord.
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C5V23">&nbsp;</a>For the husband is the head of the wife, as Christ also is the head of the assembly, being himself the
savior of the body.
 <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C5V24">&nbsp;</a>But as the assembly is subject to Christ, so let the wives also be to their own husbands in everything.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C5V25">&nbsp;</a>Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the assembly, and gave himself up for it;
 <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C5V26">&nbsp;</a>that he might sanctify it, having cleansed it by the washing of water with the word,
 <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C5V27">&nbsp;</a>that he might present the assembly to himself gloriously, not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing;
but that it should be holy and without defect.
 <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C5V28">&nbsp;</a>Even so husbands also ought to love their own wives as their own bodies. He who loves his own wife loves
himself.
 <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C5V29">&nbsp;</a>For no man ever hated his own flesh; but nourishes and cherishes it, even as the Lord also does the assembly;
 <span class="verse"> 30</span><a name="C5V30">&nbsp;</a>because we are members of his body, of his flesh and bones.
 <span class="verse"> 31</span><a name="C5V31">&nbsp;</a>“For this cause a man will leave his father and mother, and will be joined to his wife. The two will
become one flesh.”<a href="#FN1"><span class="notemark"></span><span class="popup">+ Genesis 2:24</span></a>
 <span class="verse"> 32</span><a name="C5V32">&nbsp;</a>This mystery is great, but I speak concerning Christ and of the assembly.
 <span class="verse"> 33</span><a name="C5V33">&nbsp;</a>Nevertheless each of you must also love his own wife even as himself; and let the wife see that she respects
her husband.
