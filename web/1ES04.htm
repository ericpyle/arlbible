 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C4V1">&nbsp;</a>Then the second, that had spoken of the strength of the king, began to say,
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C4V2">&nbsp;</a>O sirs, do not men excel in strength, that bear rule over the sea and land, and all things in them?
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C4V3">&nbsp;</a>But yet is the king stronger: and he is their lord, and has dominion over them; and in whatever he commands
them they obey him.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C4V4">&nbsp;</a>If he bid them make war the one against the other, they do it: and if he send them out against the enemies,
they go, and overcome mountains, walls, and towers.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C4V5">&nbsp;</a>They kill and are slain, and transgress not the king’s commandment: if they get the victory, they bring
all to the king, as well the spoil, as all things else.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C4V6">&nbsp;</a>Likewise for those that are no soldiers, and have not to do with wars, but use husbandry, when they have
reaped again that which they had sown, they bring it to the king, and compel one another to pay tribute
to the king.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C4V7">&nbsp;</a>And he is
<a href="#FN1"><span class="notemark">*</span><span class="popup">Or,
one and alone</span></a>
 but one man: if he command to kill, they kill; if he command to spare, they spare;
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C4V8">&nbsp;</a>if he command to strike, they strike; if he command to make desolate, they make desolate; if he command
to build, they build;
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C4V9">&nbsp;</a>if he command to cut down, they cut down; if he command to plant, they plant.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C4V10">&nbsp;</a>So all his people and his armies obey him: furthermore he lies down, he eats and drinks, and takes his
rest:
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C4V11">&nbsp;</a>and these keep watch round about him, neither may any one depart, and do his own business, neither disobey
they him
<span class="add">in anything.
</span> <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C4V12">&nbsp;</a>O sirs, how should not the king be strongest, seeing that in such sort he is obeyed? And he held his
peace.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C4V13">&nbsp;</a>Then the third, who had spoken of women, and of truth, (this was Zorobabel) began to speak.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C4V14">&nbsp;</a>O sirs, is not the king great, and men are many, and wine is strong? who is it then that rules them,
or has the lordship over them? are they not women?
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C4V15">&nbsp;</a>Women have borne the king and all the people that bear rule by sea and land.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C4V16">&nbsp;</a>Even of them came they: and they nourished them up that planted the vineyards, from whence the wine comes.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C4V17">&nbsp;</a>These also make garments for men; these bring glory to men; and without women can’t men be.
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C4V18">&nbsp;</a>Yes, and if men have gathered together gold and silver and any other goodly thing,
<a href="#FN2"><span class="notemark">†</span><span class="popup">Another reading is,
do they not love etc.</span></a>
 and see a woman which is comely in favor and beauty,
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C4V19">&nbsp;</a>they let all those things go, and gape after her, and even with open mouth fix their eyes fast on her;
and have all more desire to her than to gold or silver, or any goodly thing whatever.
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C4V20">&nbsp;</a>A man leaves his own father that brought him up, and his own country, and cleaves to his wife.
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C4V21">&nbsp;</a>And with his wife he ends his days, and remembers neither father, nor mother, nor country.
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C4V22">&nbsp;</a>By this also you⌃ must know that women have dominion over you: do you⌃ not labor and toil, and give and
bring all to women?
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C4V23">&nbsp;</a>Yes, a man takes his sword, and goes forth to make outroads, and to rob and to steal, and to sail upon
the sea and upon rivers;
 <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C4V24">&nbsp;</a>and looks upon a lion, and walks in the darkness; and when he has stolen, spoiled, and robbed, he brings
it to his love.
 <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C4V25">&nbsp;</a>Wherefore a man loves his wife better than father or mother.
 <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C4V26">&nbsp;</a>Yes, many there be that have run out of their wits for women, and become bondmen for their sakes.
 <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C4V27">&nbsp;</a>Many also have perished, have stumbled, and sinned, for women.
 <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C4V28">&nbsp;</a>And now do you⌃ not believe me? is not the king great in his power? do not all regions fear to touch
him?
 <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C4V29">&nbsp;</a>Yet did I see him and Apame the king’s concubine, the daughter of the illustrious Barticus, sitting at
the right hand of the king,
 <span class="verse"> 30</span><a name="C4V30">&nbsp;</a>and taking the crown from the king’s head, and setting it upon her own head; yes, she struck the king
with her left hand:
 <span class="verse"> 31</span><a name="C4V31">&nbsp;</a>and therewithal the king gaped and gazed upon her with open mouth: if she laughed upon him, he laughed
also: but if she took any displeasure at him, he was fain to flatter, that she might be reconciled to
him again.
 <span class="verse"> 32</span><a name="C4V32">&nbsp;</a>O sirs, how can it be but women should be strong, seeing they do thus?
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 33</span><a name="C4V33">&nbsp;</a>Then the king and the nobles looked one upon another: so he began to speak concerning truth.
 <span class="verse"> 34</span><a name="C4V34">&nbsp;</a>O sirs, are not women strong? great is the earth, high is the heaven, swift is the sun in his course,
for he encircles the heavens round about, and fetches his course again to his own place in one day.
 <span class="verse"> 35</span><a name="C4V35">&nbsp;</a>Is he not great that makes these things? therefore great is truth, and stronger than all things.
 <span class="verse"> 36</span><a name="C4V36">&nbsp;</a>All the earth calls upon truth, and the heaven blesses her: all works shake and tremble, but with
<a href="#FN3"><span class="notemark">‡</span><span class="popup">Another reading is, him.</span></a>
 her is no unrighteous thing.
 <span class="verse"> 37</span><a name="C4V37">&nbsp;</a>Wine is unrighteous, the king is unrighteous, women are unrighteous, all the children of men are unrighteous,
and unrighteous are all such their works; and there is no truth in them; in their unrighteousness also
they shall perish.
 <span class="verse"> 38</span><a name="C4V38">&nbsp;</a>But truth remains, and is strong forever; she lives and conquers forevermore.
 <span class="verse"> 39</span><a name="C4V39">&nbsp;</a>With her there is no accepting of persons or rewards; but she does the things that are just,
<span class="add">and refrains</span> from all unrighteous and wicked things; and all men do well like of her works.
 <span class="verse"> 40</span><a name="C4V40">&nbsp;</a>Neither in her judgment is any unrighteousness; and she is the strength, and the kingdom, and the power,
and the majesty, of all ages. Blessed be the God of truth.
 <span class="verse"> 41</span><a name="C4V41">&nbsp;</a>And with that he held his tongue. And all the people then shouted, and said, Great is truth, and strong
above all things.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 42</span><a name="C4V42">&nbsp;</a>Then said the king to him, Ask what you will more than is appointed in writing, and we will give it you,
inasmuch as you are found wisest; and you shall sit next me, and shall be called my cousin.
 <span class="verse"> 43</span><a name="C4V43">&nbsp;</a>Then said he to the king, Remember your vow, which you did vow to build Jerusalem, in the day when you
came to your kingdom,
 <span class="verse"> 44</span><a name="C4V44">&nbsp;</a>and to send away all the vessels that were taken out of Jerusalem, which Cyrus set apart, when he vowed
to destroy Babylon, and vowed to send them again there.
 <span class="verse"> 45</span><a name="C4V45">&nbsp;</a>You did also vow to build up the temple, which the Edomites burned when Judaea was made desolate by the
Chaldeans.
 <span class="verse"> 46</span><a name="C4V46">&nbsp;</a>And now, O lord the king, this is that which I require, and which I desire of you, and this is the princely
liberality that shall proceed from you: I pray therefore that you make good the vow, the performance
whereof you have vowed to the King of heaven with your own mouth.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 47</span><a name="C4V47">&nbsp;</a>Then Darius the king stood up, and kissed him, and wrote letters for him to all the treasurers and governors
and captains and satraps, that they should safely bring on their way both him, and all those that should
go up with him to build Jerusalem.
 <span class="verse"> 48</span><a name="C4V48">&nbsp;</a>He wrote letters also to all the governors that were in Coelesyria and Phoenicia, and to them in Libanus,
that they should bring cedar wood from Libanus to Jerusalem, and that they should build the city with
him.
 <span class="verse"> 49</span><a name="C4V49">&nbsp;</a>Moreover he wrote for all the Jews that should go out of his realm up into Jewry, concerning their freedom,
that no officer, no governor, no satrap, nor treasurer, should forcibly enter into their doors;
 <span class="verse"> 50</span><a name="C4V50">&nbsp;</a>and that all the country which they occupied should be free to them without tribute; and that the Edomites
should give over the villages of the Jews which then they held:
 <span class="verse"> 51</span><a name="C4V51">&nbsp;</a>and that there should be yearly given twenty talents to the building of the temple, until the time that
it were built;
 <span class="verse"> 52</span><a name="C4V52">&nbsp;</a>and other ten talents yearly, for burnt offerings to be presented upon the altar every day, as they had
a commandment to offer seventeen:
 <span class="verse"> 53</span><a name="C4V53">&nbsp;</a>and that all they that should come from Babylonia to build the city should have their freedom, as well
they as their posterity, and all the priests that came.
 <span class="verse"> 54</span><a name="C4V54">&nbsp;</a>He wrote also
<span class="add">to give them</span> their charges, and the priests’ vestments wherein they minister;
 <span class="verse"> 55</span><a name="C4V55">&nbsp;</a>and for the Levites he wrote that their charges should be given them until the day that the house were
finished, and Jerusalem builded up.
 <span class="verse"> 56</span><a name="C4V56">&nbsp;</a>And he commanded to give to all that kept the city lands and wages.
 <span class="verse"> 57</span><a name="C4V57">&nbsp;</a>He sent away also all the vessels from Babylon, that Cyrus had set apart; and all that Cyrus had given
in commandment, the same charged he also to be done, and sent to Jerusalem.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 58</span><a name="C4V58">&nbsp;</a>Now when this young man was gone forth, he lifted up his face to heaven toward Jerusalem, and praised
the King of heaven,
 <span class="verse"> 59</span><a name="C4V59">&nbsp;</a>and said, From you comes victory, from you comes wisdom, and your is the glory, and I am your servant.
 <span class="verse"> 60</span><a name="C4V60">&nbsp;</a>Blessed are you, who have given me wisdom: and to you I give thanks, O Lord of our fathers.
 <span class="verse"> 61</span><a name="C4V61">&nbsp;</a>And so he took the letters, and went out, and came to Babylon, and told it all his brethren.
 <span class="verse"> 62</span><a name="C4V62">&nbsp;</a>And they praised the God of their fathers, because he had given them freedom and liberty
 <span class="verse"> 63</span><a name="C4V63">&nbsp;</a>to go up, and to build Jerusalem, and the temple which is called by his name: and they feasted with instruments
of music and gladness seven days.
