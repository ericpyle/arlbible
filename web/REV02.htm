these things:</span></div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C2V2">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">“I know your works, and your toil and perseverance, and that you can’t tolerate evil men, and have tested
those who call themselves apostles, and they are not, and found them false.

</span> <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C2V5">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Remember therefore from where you have fallen, and repent and do the first works; or else I am coming
to you swiftly, and will move your lamp stand out of its place, unless you repent.
</span> <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C2V6">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">But this you have, that you hate the works of the Nicolaitans, which I also hate.
</span> <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C2V7">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the assemblies. To him who overcomes I will give
to eat from the tree of life, which is in the Paradise of my God.</span></div>

<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C2V9">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">“I know your works, oppression, and your poverty (but you are rich), and the blasphemy of those who say
they are Jews, and they are not, but are a synagogue of Satan.
</span> <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C2V10">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Don’t be afraid of the things which you are about to suffer. Behold, the devil is about to throw some
of you into prison, that you may be tested; and you will have oppression for ten days. Be faithful to
death, and I will give you the crown of life.
</span> <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C2V11">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the assemblies. He who overcomes won’t be harmed

dwells.

taught Balak to throw a stumbling block before the children of Israel, to eat things sacrificed to idols,
and to commit sexual immorality.

of my mouth.

immorality, and to eat things sacrificed to idols.
</span> <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C2V21">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">I gave her time to repent, but she refuses to repent of her sexual immorality.
</span> <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C2V22">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Behold, I will throw her into a bed, and those who commit adultery with her into great oppression, unless

and hearts. I will give to each one of you according to your deeds.
</span> <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C2V24">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">But to you I say, to the rest who are in Thyatira, as many as don’t have this teaching, who don’t know
what some call ‘the deep things of Satan,’ to you I say, I am not putting any other burden on you.
