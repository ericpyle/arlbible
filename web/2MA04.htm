<span class="add">saying
</span> that it was he who had incited Heliodorus, and made himself the author of these evils.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C4V2">&nbsp;</a>And him that was the benefactor of the city, and the guardian of his fellow countrymen, and a zealot

 Apollonius

 people, both public and private;
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C4V6">&nbsp;</a>for he saw that without the king’s providence it was impossible for the state to obtain peace any more,
and that Simon would not cease from his madness.

<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C4V7">&nbsp;</a>But when Seleucus was deceased, and Antiochus, who was called Epiphanes, succeeded to the kingdom, Jason
the brother of Onias supplanted
<span class="add">his brother

 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C4V8">&nbsp;</a>having promised to the king at an audience three hundred and threescore talents of silver, and
<span class="add">out
</span> of another fund eighty talents;
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C4V9">&nbsp;</a>and beside this, he undertook to assign a hundred and fifty more, if it might be allowed him

 through the king’s authority to set him up a

</span> and to register the inhabitants of Jerusalem as
<span class="add">citizens
</span> of Antioch.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C4V10">&nbsp;</a>And when the king had given assent, and he had gotten possession of the office, he forthwith brought
over them of his own race to the Greek fashion.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C4V11">&nbsp;</a>And setting aside the royal ordinances of special favor to the Jews, granted by the means of John the
father of Eupolemus, who went on the ambassage to the Romans for friendship and alliance, and seeking
to overthrow the lawful modes of life, he brought in new customs forbidden by the law:
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C4V12">&nbsp;</a>for he eagerly established a
<span class="add">Greek
</span> place of exercise under the citadel itself; and caused the noblest of the young men to wear the
<span class="add">Greek
</span> cap.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C4V13">&nbsp;</a>And thus there was an extreme of Greek fashions, and an advance of an alien religion, by reason of the
exceeding profaneness of Jason, that ungodly man and no high priest;
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C4V14">&nbsp;</a>so that the priests had no more any zeal for the services of the altar: but despising the sanctuary,
and neglecting the sacrifices, they hastened to

and to whom they desired to be made like in all things, these they had to be their enemies and to punish
them.

 present circumstances it went to the equipment of the galleys.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C4V21">&nbsp;</a>Now when Apollonius the
<span class="add">son
</span> of Menestheus was sent into Egypt for the

</span></a>
 enthronement of
<span class="add">Ptolemy
</span> Philometor as king, Antiochus, learning that
<span class="add">Ptolemy

going
<span class="add">by sea
</span> to Joppa, he travelled on to Jerusalem.
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C4V22">&nbsp;</a>And being magnificently received by Jason and the city, he was brought in with torches and shoutings.
This done, he afterward led his army down into Phoenicia.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C4V23">&nbsp;</a>Now after a space of three years Jason sent Menelaus, the aforesaid Simon’s brother, to bear the money

<span class="add">to Jerusalem,
</span> bringing nothing worthy the high priesthood, but having the passion of a cruel tyrant, and the rage

 <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C4V26">&nbsp;</a>And whereas Jason, who had supplanted his own brother, was supplanted by another and driven as a fugitive
into the country of the Ammonites,
 <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C4V27">&nbsp;</a>Menelaus had possession of the office: but of the money that had been promised to the king nothing

 was duly paid, and that though Sostratus the governor of the citadel demanded it

king to his presence.
 <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C4V29">&nbsp;</a>And Menelaus left his own brother Lysimachus for his

<span class="add">left

<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 30</span><a name="C4V30">&nbsp;</a>Now while such was the state of things, it came to pass that they of Tarsus and Mallus made insurrection,
because they were to be given as a present to Antiochis, the king’s concubine.
 <span class="verse"> 31</span><a name="C4V31">&nbsp;</a>The king therefore came
<span class="add">to Cilicia
</span> in all haste to settle matters, leaving for his

</span></a>
 deputy Andronicus, a man of high rank.
 <span class="verse"> 32</span><a name="C4V32">&nbsp;</a>And Menelaus, supposing that he had gotten a favourable opportunity, presented to Andronicus certain
vessels of gold belonging to the temple, which he had stolen: other
<span class="add">vessels
</span> also he had already sold into Tyre and the cities round about.
 <span class="verse"> 33</span><a name="C4V33">&nbsp;</a>And when Onias had sure knowledge
<span class="add">of this,
</span> he sharply reproved him, having withdrawn himself into a sanctuary at Daphne, that lies by Antioch.
 <span class="verse"> 34</span><a name="C4V34">&nbsp;</a>Wherefore Menelaus, taking Andronicus apart, prayed him
<a href="#FN20"><span class="notemark">§§</span><span class="popup">Or,
to get Onias into his hands
</span></a>
 to kill Onias. And coming to Onias, and
<a href="#FN21"><span class="notemark">***</span><span class="popup">The Greek text of this sentence is probably corrupt.
</span></a>
 being persuaded to use treachery, and being received as a friend,
<span class="add">Andronicus
</span> gave him his right hand with oaths
<span class="add">of fidelity,
</span> and, though he was suspected
<span class="add">by him, so
</span> persuaded him to come forth of the sanctuary; and forthwith he
<a href="#FN22"><span class="notemark">†††</span><span class="popup">Or,
imprisoned him

shut him off.
</span></a>
 despatched him without regard of justice.
 <span class="verse"> 35</span><a name="C4V35">&nbsp;</a>For the which cause not only Jews, but many also of the other nations, had indignation and displeasure
at the unjust murder of the man.
 <span class="verse"> 36</span><a name="C4V36">&nbsp;</a>And when the king was come back again from the places in Cilicia, the Jews that were
<a href="#FN23"><span class="notemark">‡‡‡</span><span class="popup">Or,
in the several cities
</span></a>
 in the city pleaded before
<span class="add">him against Andronicus
</span> (the Greeks also joining with them in hatred of the wickedness), urging that Onias had been wrongfully
slain.
 <span class="verse"> 37</span><a name="C4V37">&nbsp;</a>Antiochus therefore was heartily sorry, and was moved to pity, and wept, because of the sober and well
ordered life of him that was dead;
 <span class="verse"> 38</span><a name="C4V38">&nbsp;</a>and being inflamed with passion, forthwith he stripped off Andronicus’s purple robe, and
<a href="#FN24"><span class="notemark">§§§</span><span class="popup">Or,
tore his
</span></a>
 tore off his under garments, and when he had led him round through the whole city to that very place
where he had committed impiety against Onias, there he put the murderer out of the way, the Lord rendering
to him the punishment he had deserved.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 39</span><a name="C4V39">&nbsp;</a>Now when many sacrileges had been committed in the city by Lysimachus with the consent of Menelaus, and
when the bruit thereof was spread abroad outside, the people gathered themselves together against Lysimachus,
after many vessels of gold had been already dispersed.
 <span class="verse"> 40</span><a name="C4V40">&nbsp;</a>And when the multitudes were rising against
<span class="add">him,
</span> and were filled with anger, Lysimachus armed about three thousand men, and with unrighteous violence
began
<span class="add">the conflict,
</span> one Hauran, a man far gone in years and no less also in madness, leading
<span class="add">the attack.
</span> <span class="verse"> 41</span><a name="C4V41">&nbsp;</a>But when they perceived the assault of Lysimachus, some caught up stones, others logs of wood, and some
took handfuls of the ashes that lay near, and they flung them all pell-mell upon Lysimachus and them
that were with him;
 <span class="verse"> 42</span><a name="C4V42">&nbsp;</a>by reason of which they wounded many of them, and some they struck to the ground, and all
<span class="add">of them
</span> they forced to flee, but the author of the sacrilege himself they killed beside the treasury.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 43</span><a name="C4V43">&nbsp;</a>But touching these matters there was an accusation laid against Menelaus.
 <span class="verse"> 44</span><a name="C4V44">&nbsp;</a>And when the king was come to Tyre, the three men that were sent by the senate pleaded the cause before
him.
 <span class="verse"> 45</span><a name="C4V45">&nbsp;</a>But Menelaus, seeing himself now defeated, promised much money to Ptolemy the
<span class="add">son
</span> of Dorymenes, that he might win over the king.
 <span class="verse"> 46</span><a name="C4V46">&nbsp;</a>Whereupon Ptolemy taking the king aside into a cloister, as it were to take the air, brought him to be
of another mind:
 <span class="verse"> 47</span><a name="C4V47">&nbsp;</a>and him that was the cause of all the evil, Menelaus, he discharged from the accusations; but these hapless
men, who, if they had pleaded even before Scythians, would have been discharged uncondemned, them he
sentenced to death.
 <span class="verse"> 48</span><a name="C4V48">&nbsp;</a>Soon then did they that were spokesmen for the city and the families
<span class="add">of Israel
</span> and the holy vessels suffer that unrighteous penalty.
 <span class="verse"> 49</span><a name="C4V49">&nbsp;</a>For which cause even certain Tyrians, moved with hatred of the wickedness, provided magnificently for
their burial.
 <span class="verse"> 50</span><a name="C4V50">&nbsp;</a>But Menelaus through the covetous dealings of them that were in power remained still in his office,
