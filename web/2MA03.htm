 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C3V1">&nbsp;</a>WHEN the holy city was inhabited with all peace, and the laws were kept very well, because of the godliness
of Onias the high priest, and his hatred of wickedness,
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C3V2">&nbsp;</a>it came to pass that even the kings themselves did honor the place, and glorify the temple with the noblest
presents;
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C3V3">&nbsp;</a>insomuch that even Seleucus the king of Asia of his own revenues bare all the costs belonging to the
services of the sacrifices.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C3V4">&nbsp;</a>But one Simon of the tribe of Benjamin, having been made guardian of the temple, fell out with the high
priest about the
<a href="#FN1"><span class="notemark">*</span><span class="popup">Or,

office of aedile.
</span></a>
 ruling of the market in the city.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C3V5">&nbsp;</a>And when he could not overcome Onias, he got him to Apollonius
<span class="add">the son
</span> of
<a href="#FN2"><span class="notemark">†</span><span class="popup">Or,
Thraseas
The Greek text is probably corrupt. Perhaps the true reading is
Apollonius of Tarsus.
</span></a>
 Thrasaeus, who at that time was governor of Coelesyria and Phoenicia:
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C3V6">&nbsp;</a>and he brought him word how that the treasury in Jerusalem was full of untold sums of money, so that
the multitude of the funds was innumerable, and that they did not pertain to the account of the sacrifices,
but that it was possible that these should fall under the king’s power.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C3V7">&nbsp;</a>And when Apollonius met the king, he informed him of the money whereof he had been told; and the
<span class="add">king
</span> appointed Heliodorus, who was his chancellor, and sent him with a commandment to accomplish the removal
of the aforesaid money.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C3V8">&nbsp;</a>So forthwith Heliodorus took his journey, under a color of visiting the cities of Coelesyria and Phoenicia,
but in fact to execute the king’s purpose.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C3V9">&nbsp;</a>And when he was come to Jerusalem, and had been courteously received by the high priest
<a href="#FN3"><span class="notemark">‡</span><span class="popup">Some authorities read
and of the city.
</span></a>
 of the city, he laid before
<a href="#FN4"><span class="notemark">§</span><span class="popup">Or,
him
</span></a>
<span class="add">them
</span> an account of the information which had been given
<span class="add">him,
</span> and declared wherefore he was come; and he inquired if in truth these things were so.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C3V10">&nbsp;</a>And the high priest explained to him that there were
<span class="add">in the treasury
</span> deposits of widows and orphans,
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C3V11">&nbsp;</a>and moreover some
<span class="add">money
</span> belonging to Hyrcanus the
<span class="add">son
</span> of Tobias, a man in very high place,
<a href="#FN5"><span class="notemark">**</span><span class="popup">Or, and
not
such a man
as that impious Simon slanderously alleged
</span></a>
<span class="add">and that the case was
</span> not as that impious Simon falsely alleged; and that in all there were four hundred talents of silver
and two hundred of gold;
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C3V12">&nbsp;</a>and that it was altogether impossible that wrong should be done to them that had put trust in the holiness
of the place, and in the majesty and inviolable sanctity of the temple, honored over all the world.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C3V13">&nbsp;</a>But
<a href="#FN6"><span class="notemark">††</span><span class="popup">Some authorities read
the other.
</span></a>
 Heliodorus, because of the king’s commandments given him, said that in any case this
<span class="add">money
</span> must be confiscated for the king’s treasury.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C3V14">&nbsp;</a>So having appointed a day, he entered in to direct the inquiry concerning these matters; and there was
no small distress throughout the whole city.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C3V15">&nbsp;</a>And the priests, prostrating themselves before the altar in their priestly garments, and
<span class="add">looking
</span> toward heaven, called upon him that gave the law concerning deposits, that he should preserve these
<span class="add">treasures
</span> safe for those that had deposited them.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C3V16">&nbsp;</a>And whoever saw the mien of the high priest was wounded in mind; for his countenance and the change of
his color betrayed the distress of his soul.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C3V17">&nbsp;</a>For a terror and a shuddering of the body had come over the man, whereby the pain that was in his heart
was plainly shewn to them that looked upon him.
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C3V18">&nbsp;</a>And they that were in the houses rushed flocking out to make a universal supplication, because the place
was like to come into contempt.
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C3V19">&nbsp;</a>And the women, girded with sackcloth under their breasts, thronged the streets, and the virgins that
were kept in ward ran together, some to the
<a href="#FN7"><span class="notemark">‡‡</span><span class="popup">Or,
porches
</span></a>
 gates, others to the walls, and some looked out through the windows.
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C3V20">&nbsp;</a>And all, stretching forth their hands toward heaven, made their solemn supplication.
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C3V21">&nbsp;</a>Then it would have pitied a man to see the multitude prostrating themselves all mingled together, and
the expectation of the high priest in his sore distress.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C3V22">&nbsp;</a>While therefore they called upon the Almighty Lord to keep the things intrusted
<span class="add">to them
</span><a href="#FN8"><span class="notemark">§§</span><span class="popup">Gr.
safe with all security.
</span></a>
 safe and sure for those that had intrusted them,
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C3V23">&nbsp;</a>Heliodorus went on to execute that which had been decreed.
 <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C3V24">&nbsp;</a>But when he was already present there with his guards over against the treasury, the Soverign of spirits
and of all authority caused a great
<a href="#FN9"><span class="notemark">***</span><span class="popup">Gr.
manifestation.
</span></a>
 apparition, so that all that had presumed to come
<span class="add">in
</span> with him, stricken with dismay at the power of God, fainted and were sore afraid.
 <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C3V25">&nbsp;</a>For there was seen by them a horse with a terrible rider upon him, and adorned with beautiful trappings,
and he rushed fiercely and struck at Heliodorus with his forefeet, and it seemed that he that sat upon
the horse had complete armor of gold.
 <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C3V26">&nbsp;</a>Two other also appeared to him, young men notable in their strength, and beautiful in their glory, and
splendid in their apparel, who stood by him on either side, and scourged him unceasingly, inflicting
on him many sore stripes.
 <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C3V27">&nbsp;</a>And when he had fallen suddenly to the ground, and great darkness had come over him,
<span class="add">his guards
</span> caught him up and put him into a litter,
 <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C3V28">&nbsp;</a>and carried him, him that had just now entered with a great train and all his guard into the aforesaid
treasury, himself now brought to utter helplessness, manifestly made to recognize the sovereignty of
God.
 <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C3V29">&nbsp;</a>And so, while he, through the working of God, speechless and bereft of all hope and deliverance, lay
prostrate,
 <span class="verse"> 30</span><a name="C3V30">&nbsp;</a>they blessed the Lord, that made marvelous his own place; and the temple, which a little before was full
of terror and alarm, was filled with joy and gladness after the Almighty Lord appeared.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 31</span><a name="C3V31">&nbsp;</a>But quickly certain of Heliodorus’s familiar friends implored Onias to call upon the Most High, and grant
life to him who lay quite at the last gasp.
 <span class="verse"> 32</span><a name="C3V32">&nbsp;</a>And the high priest, secretly fearing lest the king might come to think that some treachery toward Heliodorus
had been perpetrated by the Jews, brought a sacrifice for the deliverance of the man.
 <span class="verse"> 33</span><a name="C3V33">&nbsp;</a>But as the high priest was making the propitiation, the same young men appeared again to Heliodorus,
arrayed in the same garments; and they stood and said, Give Onias the high priest great thanks, for for
his sake the Lord has granted you life;
 <span class="verse"> 34</span><a name="C3V34">&nbsp;</a>and do you, since you have been scourged from heaven, publish to all men the sovereign majesty of God.
And when they had spoken these words, they vanished out of sight.
 <span class="verse"> 35</span><a name="C3V35">&nbsp;</a>So Heliodorus, having offered a sacrifice to the Lord and vowed
<a href="#FN10"><span class="notemark">†††</span><span class="popup">Gr.
greatest.
</span></a>
 great vows to him that had saved his life, and having graciously received Onias, returned with his host
to the king.
 <span class="verse"> 36</span><a name="C3V36">&nbsp;</a>And he testified to all men the works of the
<a href="#FN11"><span class="notemark">‡‡‡</span><span class="popup">Gr.
greatest.
</span></a>
 great God which he had seen with his eyes.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 37</span><a name="C3V37">&nbsp;</a>And when the king asked Heliodorus, what manner of man was fit to be sent yet once again to Jerusalem,
he said,
 <span class="verse"> 38</span><a name="C3V38">&nbsp;</a>If you have any enemy or conspirator against the state, send him there, and you shall receive him back
well scourged, if he even escape with his life; because of a truth there is about the place a power of
God.
 <span class="verse"> 39</span><a name="C3V39">&nbsp;</a>For he that has his dwelling in heaven himself has his eyes upon that place, and helps it; and them that
come to hurt it he smiteth and destroys.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 40</span><a name="C3V40">&nbsp;</a>And such was the history of Heliodorus and the keeping of the treasury.
