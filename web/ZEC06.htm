 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C6V1">&nbsp;</a>Again I lifted up my eyes, and saw, and behold, four chariots came out from between two mountains; and
the mountains were mountains of brass.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C6V2">&nbsp;</a>In the first chariot were red horses; in the second chariot black horses;
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C6V3">&nbsp;</a>in the third chariot white horses; and in the fourth chariot dappled horses, all of them powerful.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C6V4">&nbsp;</a>Then I asked the angel who talked with me, “What are these, my lord?”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C6V5">&nbsp;</a>The angel answered me, “These are the four winds of the sky, which go out from standing before the Lord
of all the earth.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C6V6">&nbsp;</a>The one with the black horses goes out toward the north country; and the white went out after them; and
the dappled went out toward the south country.”
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C6V7">&nbsp;</a>The strong went out, and sought to go that they might walk back and forth through the earth: and he said,
“Go around and through the earth!” So they walked back and forth through the earth.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C6V8">&nbsp;</a>Then he called to me, and spoke to me, saying, “Behold, those who go toward the north country have quieted
my spirit in the north country.”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C6V9">&nbsp;</a>Yahweh’s word came to me, saying,
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C6V10">&nbsp;</a>“Take of them of the captivity, even of Heldai, of Tobijah, and of Jedaiah; and come the same day, and
go into the house of Josiah the son of Zephaniah, where they have come from Babylon.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C6V11">&nbsp;</a>Yes, take silver and gold, and make crowns, and set them on the head of Joshua the son of Jehozadak,
the high priest;
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C6V12">&nbsp;</a>and speak to him, saying, ‘Yahweh of Armies says, “Behold, the man whose name is the Branch: and he shall
grow up out of his place; and he shall build Yahweh’s temple;
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C6V13">&nbsp;</a>even he shall build Yahweh’s temple; and he shall bear the glory, and shall sit and rule on his throne;
and he shall be a priest on his throne; and the counsel of peace shall be between them both.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C6V14">&nbsp;</a>The crowns shall be to Helem, and to Tobijah, and to Jedaiah, and to Hen the son of Zephaniah, for a
memorial in Yahweh’s temple.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C6V15">&nbsp;</a>Those who are far off shall come and build in Yahweh’s temple; and you shall know that Yahweh of Armies
has sent me to you. This will happen, if you will diligently obey Yahweh your God’s voice.”’”<a href="#FN1"><span class="notemark">*</span><span class="popup">The Hebrew word rendered “God” is “אֱלֹהִ֑ים” (Elohim).</span></a>
