 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C20V1">&nbsp;</a>Abraham traveled from there toward the land of the South, and lived between Kadesh and Shur. He lived
as a foreigner in Gerar.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C20V2">&nbsp;</a>Abraham said about Sarah his wife, “She is my sister.” Abimelech king of Gerar sent, and took Sarah.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C20V3">&nbsp;</a>But God came to Abimelech in a dream of the night, and said to him, “Behold, you are a dead man, because
of the woman whom you have taken. For she is a man’s wife.”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C20V4">&nbsp;</a>Now Abimelech had not come near her. He said, “Lord, will you kill even a righteous nation?
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C20V5">&nbsp;</a>Didn’t he tell me, ‘She is my sister?’ She, even she herself, said, ‘He is my brother.’ In the integrity
of my heart and the innocence of my hands I have done this.”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C20V6">&nbsp;</a>God said to him in the dream, “Yes, I know that in the integrity of your heart you have done this, and
I also withheld you from sinning against me. Therefore I didn’t allow you to touch her.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C20V7">&nbsp;</a>Now therefore, restore the man’s wife. For he is a prophet, and he will pray for you, and you will live.
If you don’t restore her, know for sure that you will die, you, and all who are yours.”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C20V8">&nbsp;</a>Abimelech rose early in the morning, and called all his servants, and told all these things in their
ear. The men were very scared.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C20V9">&nbsp;</a>Then Abimelech called Abraham, and said to him, “What have you done to us? How have I sinned against
you, that you have brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin? You have done deeds to me that ought
not to be done!”
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C20V10">&nbsp;</a>Abimelech said to Abraham, “What did you see, that you have done this thing?”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C20V11">&nbsp;</a>Abraham said, “Because I thought, ‘Surely the fear of God is not in this place. They will kill me for
my wife’s sake.’
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C20V12">&nbsp;</a>Besides, she is indeed my sister, the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother; and she
became my wife.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C20V13">&nbsp;</a>When God caused me to wander from my father’s house, I said to her, ‘This is your kindness which you
shall show to me. Everywhere that we go, say of me, “He is my brother.”’”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C20V14">&nbsp;</a>Abimelech took sheep and cattle, male servants and female servants, and gave them to Abraham, and restored
Sarah, his wife, to him.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C20V15">&nbsp;</a>Abimelech said, “Behold, my land is before you. Dwell where it pleases you.”
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C20V16">&nbsp;</a>To Sarah he said, “Behold, I have given your brother a thousand pieces of silver. Behold, it is for you
a covering of the eyes to all that are with you. In front of all you are vindicated.”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C20V17">&nbsp;</a>Abraham prayed to God. God healed Abimelech, and his wife, and his female servants, and they bore children.
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C20V18">&nbsp;</a>For Yahweh had closed up tight all the wombs of the house of Abimelech, because of Sarah, Abraham’s wife.
