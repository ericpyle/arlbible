 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C8V1">&nbsp;</a>Now in the things which we are saying, the main point is this. We have such a high priest, who sat down
on the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens,
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C8V2">&nbsp;</a>a servant of the sanctuary, and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, not man.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C8V3">&nbsp;</a>For every high priest is appointed to offer both gifts and sacrifices. Therefore it is necessary that
this high priest also have something to offer.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C8V4">&nbsp;</a>For if he were on earth, he would not be a priest at all, seeing there are priests who offer the gifts
according to the law;
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C8V5">&nbsp;</a>who serve a copy and shadow of the heavenly things, even as Moses was warned by God when he was about
to make the tabernacle, for he said, “See, you shall make everything according to the pattern that was

covenant, which on better promises has been given as law.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C8V7">&nbsp;</a>For if that first covenant had been faultless, then no place would have been sought for a second.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C8V8">&nbsp;</a>For finding fault with them, he said,

<div class="q2">“that I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah;
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C8V9">&nbsp;</a>not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers,
</div>
<div class="q2">in the day that I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt;

<div class="q1">for they didn’t continue in my covenant,
