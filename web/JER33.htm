 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C33V1">&nbsp;</a>Moreover Yahweh’s word came to Jeremiah the second time, while he was still locked up in the court of
the guard, saying,
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C33V2">&nbsp;</a>“Yahweh who does it, Yahweh who forms it to establish it—Yahweh is his name, says:
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C33V3">&nbsp;</a>‘Call to me, and I will answer you, and will show you great and difficult things, which you don’t know.’
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C33V4">&nbsp;</a>For Yahweh, the God of Israel, says concerning the houses of this city and concerning the houses of the
kings of Judah, which are broken down to make a defense against the mounds and against the sword;
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C33V5">&nbsp;</a>while men come to fight with the Chaldeans, and to fill them with the dead bodies of men, whom I have
killed in my anger and in my wrath, and for all whose wickedness I have hidden my face from this city:
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C33V6">&nbsp;</a>‘Behold, I will bring it health and cure, and I will cure them; and I will reveal to them abundance of
peace and truth.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C33V7">&nbsp;</a>I will cause the captivity of Judah and the captivity of Israel to return, and will build them, as at
the first.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C33V8">&nbsp;</a>I will cleanse them from all their iniquity by which they have sinned against me. I will pardon all their
iniquities by which they have sinned against me and by which they have transgressed against me.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C33V9">&nbsp;</a>This city will be to me for a name of joy, for praise, and for glory, before all the nations of the earth,
which will hear all the good that I do to them, and will fear and tremble for all the good and for all
the peace that I provide to it.’”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C33V10">&nbsp;</a>Yahweh says: “Yet again there will be heard in this place, about which you say, ‘It is waste, without
man and without animal, even in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem, that are desolate,
without man and without inhabitant and without animal,’
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C33V11">&nbsp;</a>the voice of joy and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride, the
voice of those who say, ‘Give thanks to Yahweh of Armies, for Yahweh is good, for his loving kindness
endures forever;’ who bring thanksgiving into Yahweh’s house. For I will cause the captivity of the land
to be reversed as at the first,” says Yahweh.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C33V12">&nbsp;</a>Yahweh of Armies says: “Yet again there will be in this place, which is waste, without man and without
animal, and in all its cities, a habitation of shepherds causing their flocks to lie down.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C33V13">&nbsp;</a>In the cities of the hill country, in the cities of the lowland, in the cities of the South, in the land
of Benjamin, in the places around Jerusalem, and in the cities of Judah, the flocks will again pass under
the hands of him who counts them,” says Yahweh.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C33V14">&nbsp;</a>“Behold, the days come,” says Yahweh, “that I will perform that good word which I have spoken concerning
the house of Israel and concerning the house of Judah.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C33V15">&nbsp;</a>“In those days and at that time,
</div>
<div class="q2">I will cause a Branch of righteousness to grow up to David.
</div>
<div class="q2">He will execute justice and righteousness in the land.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C33V16">&nbsp;</a>In those days Judah will be saved,
</div>
<div class="q2">and Jerusalem will dwell safely.
</div>
<div class="q1">This is the name by which she will be called:
</div>
<div class="q2">Yahweh our righteousness.”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C33V17">&nbsp;</a>For Yahweh says: “David will never lack a man to sit on the throne of the house of Israel.
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C33V18">&nbsp;</a>The priests the Levites won’t lack a man before me to offer burnt offerings, to burn meal offerings,
and to do sacrifice continually.”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C33V19">&nbsp;</a>Yahweh’s word came to Jeremiah, saying,
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C33V20">&nbsp;</a>“Yahweh says: ‘If you can break my covenant of the day and my covenant of the night, so that there will
not be day and night in their time;
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C33V21">&nbsp;</a>then may my covenant also be broken with David my servant, that he won’t have a son to reign on his throne;
and with the Levites the priests, my ministers.
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C33V22">&nbsp;</a>As the army of the sky can’t be counted, and the sand of the sea can’t be measured; so I will multiply
the offspring<a href="#FN1"><span class="notemark">*</span><span class="popup">or, seed</span></a>
 of David my servant and the Levites who minister to me.’”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C33V23">&nbsp;</a>Yahweh’s word came to Jeremiah, saying,
 <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C33V24">&nbsp;</a>“Don’t consider what this people has spoken, saying, ‘Has Yahweh cast off the two families which he chose?’
Thus they despise my people, that they should be no more a nation before them.”
 <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C33V25">&nbsp;</a>Yahweh says: “If my covenant of day and night fails, if I have not appointed the ordinances of heaven
and earth;
 <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C33V26">&nbsp;</a>then I will also cast away the offspring<a href="#FN2"><span class="notemark">†</span><span class="popup">or, seed</span></a>
 of Jacob, and of David my servant, so that I will not take of his offspring<a href="#FN3"><span class="notemark">‡</span><span class="popup">or, seed</span></a>
 to be rulers over the offspring<a href="#FN4"><span class="notemark">§</span><span class="popup">or, seed</span></a>
 of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob: for I will cause their captivity to be reversed and will have mercy on
them.”
