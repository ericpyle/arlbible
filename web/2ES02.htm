 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C2V1">&nbsp;</a>Thus says the Lord, I brought this people out of bondage, and I gave them my commandments by my servants
the prophets; whom they would not hear, but set my counsels at nothing.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C2V2">&nbsp;</a>The mother that bare them says to them, go your way, O my children; for I am a widow and forsaken.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C2V3">&nbsp;</a>I brought you up with gladness, and with sorrow and heaviness have I lost you: for you⌃ have sinned before
the Lord God, and done that which is evil before me.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C2V4">&nbsp;</a>But what shall I now do to you? for I am a widow and forsaken: go your way, O my children, and ask mercy
of the Lord.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C2V5">&nbsp;</a>As for me, O father, I call upon you for a witness over the mother of
<span class="add">these

 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C2V7">&nbsp;</a>Let them be scattered abroad among the heathen, let their names be blotted out of the earth: for they

 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C2V8">&nbsp;</a>Woe to you, Assur, you that hide the unrighteous with you! O you wicked nation, remember what I did to
Sodom and Gomorrah;
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C2V9">&nbsp;</a>whose land lies in clods of pitch and heaps of ashes: even so also will I do to them that have not hearkened
to me, says the Lord Almighty.

<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C2V10">&nbsp;</a>Thus says the Lord to Esdras, Tell my people that I will give them the kingdom of Jerusalem, which I

not fail.

<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 33</span><a name="C2V33">&nbsp;</a>I Esdras received a charge from the Lord upon the mount Horeb, that I should go to Israel; but when I
came to them, they would none of me, and rejected the commandment of the Lord.
 <span class="verse"> 34</span><a name="C2V34">&nbsp;</a>And therefore I say to you, O you⌃ nations, that hear and understand, look for your shepherd, he shall
give you everlasting rest; for he is near at hand, that shall come in the end of the world.

 Look upon your number, O Sion, and make up the reckoning of those of your that are clothed in white,
which have fulfilled the law of the Lord.
 <span class="verse"> 41</span><a name="C2V41">&nbsp;</a>The number of your children, whom you long for, is fulfilled: beseech the power of the Lord, that your
people, which have been called from the beginning, may be hallowed.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 42</span><a name="C2V42">&nbsp;</a>I Esdras saw upon the mount Sion a great multitude, whom I could not number, and they all praised the
Lord with songs.
 <span class="verse"> 43</span><a name="C2V43">&nbsp;</a>And in the midst of them there was a young man of a high stature, taller than all the rest, and upon
every one of their heads he set crowns, and was more exalted; whereat I marveled greatly.
 <span class="verse"> 44</span><a name="C2V44">&nbsp;</a>So I asked the angel, and said, What are these, my Lord?
 <span class="verse"> 45</span><a name="C2V45">&nbsp;</a>He answered and said to me, These be they that have put off the mortal clothing, and put on the immortal,
and have confessed the name of God: now are they crowned, and receive palms.
 <span class="verse"> 46</span><a name="C2V46">&nbsp;</a>Then said I to the angel, What young man is he that sets crowns upon them, and gives them palms in their
hands?
 <span class="verse"> 47</span><a name="C2V47">&nbsp;</a>So he answered and said to me, It is the Son of God, whom they have confessed in the world. Then began
I greatly to commend them that stood so stiffly for the name of the Lord.
 <span class="verse"> 48</span><a name="C2V48">&nbsp;</a>Then the angel said to me, Go your way, and tell my people what manner of things, and how great wonders
of the Lord God you have seen.
