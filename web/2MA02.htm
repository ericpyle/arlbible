 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C2V1">&nbsp;</a>It is also found in the records, that Jeremiah the prophet commanded them that were carried away to take
of the fire, as has been signified
<span class="add">above:
</span> <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C2V2">&nbsp;</a>and how that the prophet charged them that were carried away, having given them the law, that they should
not forget the statutes of the Lord, neither be led astray in their minds, when they saw images of gold
and silver, and the adornment thereof.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C2V3">&nbsp;</a>And with other such words exhorted he them, that the law should not depart from their heart.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C2V4">&nbsp;</a>And it was
<span class="add">contained
</span> in the writing, that the prophet, being warned of God, commanded that the tabernacle and the ark should
follow with him,
<a href="#FN1"><span class="notemark">*</span><span class="popup">Gr.
and when.
The Greek text here is probably corrupt.
</span></a>
 when he went forth into the mountain where Moses went up and saw the heritage of God.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C2V5">&nbsp;</a>And Jeremiah came and found
<a href="#FN2"><span class="notemark">†</span><span class="popup">Gr.
a cavernous chamber.
</span></a>
 a chamber in the rock, and there he brought in the tabernacle, and the ark, and the altar of incense;
and he made fast the door.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C2V6">&nbsp;</a>And some of those that followed with him came there that they might mark the way, and could not find
it.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C2V7">&nbsp;</a>But when Jeremiah perceived it, he blamed them, saying, yes and the place shall be unknown until God
<a href="#FN3"><span class="notemark">‡</span><span class="popup">Gr.
gather together a gathering of the people.
</span></a>
 gather the people again together, and mercy come:
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C2V8">&nbsp;</a>and then shall the Lord disclose these things, and the glory of the Lord shall be seen, and the

 cloud.
</div>
<div class="p">As also it was showed with Moses; as also Solomon implored that the place might be consecrated greatly,
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C2V9">&nbsp;</a>and it was also declared that he, having wisdom, offered a sacrifice of dedication, and of the finishing
of the temple;
<span class="add">so we would have it now.
</span> <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C2V10">&nbsp;</a>As Moses prayed to the Lord, and fire came down out of heaven and consumed the sacrifice, even so prayed
Solomon also, and the fire came down and consumed the burnt offerings;
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C2V11">&nbsp;</a><a href="#FN5"><span class="notemark">**</span><span class="popup">See Leviticus 10:16 and 9:24.

(and Moses said, Because the sin offering had not been eaten, it was consumed in like manner
<span class="add">with the rest</span>;)
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C2V12">&nbsp;</a>and Solomon kept the eight days.

 the records that concern Nehemiah; and how he, founding a library, gathered together the books about
the kings and prophets, and the
<span class="add">books
</span> of David, and letters of kings about sacred gifts.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C2V14">&nbsp;</a>And in like manner Judas also gathered together for us all those
<span class="add">writings
</span> that had been scattered by reason of the war that befell, and they are
<span class="add">still
</span> with us.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C2V15">&nbsp;</a>If therefore you⌃ have need thereof, send some to fetch them to you.

<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C2V16">&nbsp;</a>Seeing then that we are about to keep the purification, we write to you; you⌃ will therefore do well
if you⌃ keep the days.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C2V17">&nbsp;</a>Now God, who saved all his people, and restored the heritage to all, and the kingdom, and the priesthood,
and the hallowing,
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C2V18">&nbsp;</a>even as he promised through the law,— in God have we hope, that he will quickly have mercy upon us, and
