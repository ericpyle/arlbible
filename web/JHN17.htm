 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C17V1">&nbsp;</a>Jesus said these things, and lifting up his eyes to heaven, he said,
<span class="wj">“Father, the time has come. Glorify your Son, that your Son may also glorify you;
</span> <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C17V2">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">even as you gave him authority over all flesh, he will give eternal life to all whom you have given him.
</span> <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C17V3">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">This is eternal life, that they should know you, the only true God, and him whom you sent, Jesus Christ.
</span> <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C17V4">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">I glorified you on the earth. I have accomplished the work which you have given me to do.
</span> <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C17V5">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Now, Father, glorify me with your own self with the glory which I had with you before the world existed.
</span> <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C17V6">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">I revealed your name to the people whom you have given me out of the world. They were yours, and you
have given them to me. They have kept your word.
</span> <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C17V7">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Now they have known that all things whatever you have given me are from you,
</span> <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C17V8">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">for the words which you have given me I have given to them, and they received them, and knew for sure
that I came from you, and they have believed that you sent me.
</span> <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C17V9">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">I pray for them. I don’t pray for the world, but for those whom you have given me, for they are yours.
</span> <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C17V10">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">All things that are mine are yours, and yours are mine, and I am glorified in them.
</span> <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C17V11">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">I am no more in the world, but these are in the world, and I am coming to you. Holy Father, keep them
through your name which you have given me, that they may be one, even as we are.
</span> <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C17V12">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">While I was with them in the world, I kept them in your name. Those whom you have given me I have kept.
None of them is lost, except the son of destruction, that the Scripture might be fulfilled.
</span> <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C17V13">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">But now I come to you, and I say these things in the world, that they may have my joy made full in themselves.
</span> <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C17V14">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">I have given them your word. The world hated them, because they are not of the world, even as I am not
of the world.
</span> <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C17V15">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">I pray not that you would take them from the world, but that you would keep them from the evil one.
</span> <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C17V16">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">They are not of the world even as I am not of the world.
</span> <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C17V17">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Sanctify them in your truth. Your word is truth.</span><a href="#FN1"><span class="notemark"></span><span class="popup">+ Psalm 119:142</span></a>
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C17V18">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">As you sent me into the world, even so I have sent them into the world.
</span> <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C17V19">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">For their sakes I sanctify myself, that they themselves also may be sanctified in truth.
</span> <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C17V20">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Not for these only do I pray, but for those also who believe in me through their word,
</span> <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C17V21">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">that they may all be one; even as you, Father, are in me, and I in you, that they also may be one in
us; that the world may believe that you sent me.
</span> <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C17V22">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">The glory which you have given me, I have given to them; that they may be one, even as we are one;
</span> <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C17V23">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">I in them, and you in me, that they may be perfected into one; that the world may know that you sent
me, and loved them, even as you loved me.
</span> <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C17V24">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Father, I desire that they also whom you have given me be with me where I am, that they may see my glory,
which you have given me, for you loved me before the foundation of the world.
</span> <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C17V25">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Righteous Father, the world hasn’t known you, but I knew you; and these knew that you sent me.
</span> <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C17V26">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">I made known to them your name, and will make it known; that the love with which you loved me may be
in them, and I in them.”</span></div>
