 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C12V1">&nbsp;</a>Therefore let us also, seeing we are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses, lay aside every weight
and the sin which so easily entangles us, and let us run with perseverance the race that is set before
us,
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C12V2">&nbsp;</a>looking to Jesus, the author and perfecter of faith, who for the joy that was set before him endured
the cross, despising its shame, and has sat down at the right hand of the throne of God.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C12V3">&nbsp;</a>For consider him who has endured such contradiction of sinners against himself, that you don’t grow weary,
fainting in your souls.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C12V4">&nbsp;</a>You have not yet resisted to blood, striving against sin;
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C12V5">&nbsp;</a>and you have forgotten the exhortation which reasons with you as with children,
</div>
<div class="q1">“My son, don’t take lightly the chastening of the Lord,
</div>
<div class="q2">nor faint when you are reproved by him;
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C12V6">&nbsp;</a>For whom the Lord loves, he chastens,
</div>
<div class="q2">and scourges every son whom he receives.”<a href="#FN1"><span class="notemark"></span><span class="popup">+ Proverbs 3:11-12</span></a>
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C12V7">&nbsp;</a>It is for discipline that you endure. God deals with you as with children, for what son is there whom
his father doesn’t discipline?
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C12V8">&nbsp;</a>But if you are without discipline, of which all have been made partakers, then are you illegitimate,
and not children.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C12V9">&nbsp;</a>Furthermore, we had the fathers of our flesh to chasten us, and we paid them respect. Shall we not much
rather be in subjection to the Father of spirits, and live?
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C12V10">&nbsp;</a>For they indeed, for a few days, punished us as seemed good to them; but he for our profit, that we may
be partakers of his holiness.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C12V11">&nbsp;</a>All chastening seems for the present to be not joyous but grievous; yet afterward it yields the peaceful
fruit of righteousness to those who have been exercised thereby.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C12V12">&nbsp;</a>Therefore lift up the hands that hang down and the feeble knees,
<a href="#FN2"><span class="notemark"></span><span class="popup">+ Isaiah 35:3</span></a>
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C12V13">&nbsp;</a>and make straight paths for your feet,<a href="#FN3"><span class="notemark"></span><span class="popup">+ Proverbs 4:26</span></a>
 so that which is lame may not be dislocated, but rather be healed.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C12V14">&nbsp;</a>Follow after peace with all men, and the sanctification without which no man will see the Lord,
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C12V15">&nbsp;</a>looking carefully lest there be any man who falls short of the grace of God; lest any root of bitterness
springing up trouble you, and many be defiled by it;
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C12V16">&nbsp;</a>lest there be any sexually immoral person, or profane person, like Esau, who sold his birthright for
one meal.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C12V17">&nbsp;</a>For you know that even when he afterward desired to inherit the blessing, he was rejected, for he found
no place for a change of mind though he sought it diligently with tears.
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C12V18">&nbsp;</a>For you have not come to a mountain that might be touched, and that burned with fire, and to blackness,
darkness, storm,
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C12V19">&nbsp;</a>the sound of a trumpet, and the voice of words; which those who heard it begged that not one more word
should be spoken to them,
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C12V20">&nbsp;</a>for they could not stand that which was commanded, “If even an animal touches the mountain, it shall
be stoned”<a href="#FN4"><span class="notemark">*</span><span class="popup">TR adds “or shot with an arrow”</span></a>
;<a href="#FN5"><span class="notemark"></span><span class="popup">+ Exodus 19:12-13</span></a>
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C12V21">&nbsp;</a>and so fearful was the appearance that Moses said, “I am terrified and trembling.”<a href="#FN6"><span class="notemark"></span><span class="popup">+ Deuteronomy 9:19</span></a>
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C12V22">&nbsp;</a>But you have come to Mount Zion, and to the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to innumerable
multitudes of angels,
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C12V23">&nbsp;</a>to the festal gathering and assembly of the firstborn who are enrolled in heaven, to God the Judge of
all, to the spirits of just men made perfect,
 <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C12V24">&nbsp;</a>to Jesus, the mediator of a new covenant,<a href="#FN7"><span class="notemark"></span><span class="popup">+ Jeremiah 31:31</span></a>
 and to the blood of sprinkling that speaks better than that of Abel.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C12V25">&nbsp;</a>See that you don’t refuse him who speaks. For if they didn’t escape when they refused him who warned
on the earth, how much more will we not escape who turn away from him who warns from heaven,
 <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C12V26">&nbsp;</a>whose voice shook the earth then, but now he has promised, saying, “Yet once more I will shake not only
the earth, but also the heavens.”<a href="#FN8"><span class="notemark"></span><span class="popup">+ Haggai 2:6</span></a>
 <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C12V27">&nbsp;</a>This phrase, “Yet once more”, signifies the removing of those things that are shaken, as of things that
have been made, that those things which are not shaken may remain.
 <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C12V28">&nbsp;</a>Therefore, receiving a Kingdom that can’t be shaken, let us have grace, through which we serve God acceptably,
with reverence and awe,
 <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C12V29">&nbsp;</a>for our God is a consuming fire.<a href="#FN9"><span class="notemark"></span><span class="popup">+ Deuteronomy 4:24</span></a>
