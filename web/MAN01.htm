their righteous seed;

 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C1V3">&nbsp;</a>who have bound the sea by the word of your commandment; who have shut up the deep, and sealed it by your
terrible and glorious name;
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C1V4">&nbsp;</a>whom all things fear, yes, tremble before your power;
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C1V5">&nbsp;</a>for the majesty of your glory can’t be borne, and the anger of your threatening toward sinners is importable:
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C1V6">&nbsp;</a>your merciful promise is unmeasurable and unsearchable;
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C1V7">&nbsp;</a>for you are the Lord Most High, of great compassion, longsuffering and abundant in mercy, and repent

You, O Lord, according to your great goodness have promised repentance and forgiveness to them that have
sinned against you: and of your infinite mercies have appointed repentance to sinners, that they may
be saved. You therefore, O Lord, that are the God of the just, have not appointed repentance to the just,
to Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, which have not sinned against you; but you have appointed repentance
to me that am a sinner:
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C1V9">&nbsp;</a>for I have sinned above the number of the sands of the sea. My transgressions are multiplied,
<a href="#FN4"><span class="notemark">§</span><span class="popup">The Alex. MS. omits
O Lord... multiplied.</span></a>
 O Lord: my transgressions are multiplied, and I am not worthy to behold and see the height of heaven
for the multitude of mine iniquities.

is evil before you:

I did not your will, neither kept I your commandments: I have set up abominations, and have multiplied

detestable things.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C1V11">&nbsp;</a>Now therefore I bow the knee of mine heart, beseeching you of grace.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C1V12">&nbsp;</a>I have sinned, O Lord, I have sinned, and I acknowledge mine iniquities:
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C1V13">&nbsp;</a>but, I humbly beseech you, forgive me, O Lord, forgive me, and destroy me not with mine iniquities. Be
not angry with me for ever, by reserving evil for me; neither condemn me into the lower parts of the
earth. For you,

 O Lord, are the God of them that repent;

great mercy.

and your is the glory for ever and ever. Amen.
