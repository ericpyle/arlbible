 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C13V1">&nbsp;</a>Abram went up out of Egypt—he, his wife, all that he had, and Lot with him—into the South.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C13V2">&nbsp;</a>Abram was very rich in livestock, in silver, and in gold.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C13V3">&nbsp;</a>He went on his journeys from the South even to Bethel, to the place where his tent had been at the beginning,
between Bethel and Ai,
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C13V4">&nbsp;</a>to the place of the altar, which he had made there at the first. There Abram called on Yahweh’s name.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C13V5">&nbsp;</a>Lot also, who went with Abram, had flocks, herds, and tents.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C13V6">&nbsp;</a>The land was not able to bear them, that they might live together; for their substance was great, so
that they could not live together.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C13V7">&nbsp;</a>There was strife between the herdsmen of Abram’s livestock and the herdsmen of Lot’s livestock. The Canaanites
and the Perizzites lived in the land at that time.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C13V8">&nbsp;</a>Abram said to Lot, “Please, let there be no strife between you and me, and between your herdsmen and
my herdsmen; for we are relatives.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C13V9">&nbsp;</a>Isn’t the whole land before you? Please separate yourself from me. If you go to the left hand, then I
will go to the right. Or if you go to the right hand, then I will go to the left.”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C13V10">&nbsp;</a>Lot lifted up his eyes, and saw all the plain of the Jordan, that it was well-watered everywhere, before
Yahweh destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah, like the garden of Yahweh, like the land of Egypt, as you go to
Zoar.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C13V11">&nbsp;</a>So Lot chose the Plain of the Jordan for himself. Lot traveled east, and they separated themselves the
one from the other.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C13V12">&nbsp;</a>Abram lived in the land of Canaan, and Lot lived in the cities of the plain, and moved his tent as far
as Sodom.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C13V13">&nbsp;</a>Now the men of Sodom were exceedingly wicked and sinners against Yahweh.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C13V14">&nbsp;</a>Yahweh said to Abram, after Lot was separated from him, “Now, lift up your eyes, and look from the place
where you are, northward and southward and eastward and westward,
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C13V15">&nbsp;</a>for all the land which you see, I will give to you, and to your offspring forever.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C13V16">&nbsp;</a>I will make your offspring as the dust of the earth, so that if a man can count the dust of the earth,
then your offspring<a href="#FN1"><span class="notemark">*</span><span class="popup">or, seed</span></a>
 may also be counted.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C13V17">&nbsp;</a>Arise, walk through the land in its length and in its width; for I will give it to you.”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C13V18">&nbsp;</a>Abram moved his tent, and came and lived by the oaks of Mamre, which are in Hebron, and built an altar
there to Yahweh.
