 in the wilderness and preaching the baptism of repentance for forgiveness of sins.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C1V5">&nbsp;</a>All the country of Judea and all those of Jerusalem went out to him. They were baptized by him in the
Jordan river, confessing their sins.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C1V6">&nbsp;</a>John was clothed with camel’s hair and a leather belt around his waist. He ate locusts and wild honey.

 water, but he will baptize you in the Holy Spirit.”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C1V9">&nbsp;</a>In those days, Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee, and was baptized by John in the Jordan.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C1V10">&nbsp;</a>Immediately coming up from the water, he saw the heavens parting, and the Spirit descending on him like
a dove.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C1V11">&nbsp;</a>A voice came out of the sky, “You are my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C1V12">&nbsp;</a>Immediately the Spirit drove him out into the wilderness.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C1V13">&nbsp;</a>He was there in the wilderness forty days tempted by Satan. He was with the wild animals; and the angels
were serving him.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C1V14">&nbsp;</a>Now after John was taken into custody, Jesus came into Galilee, preaching the Good News of God’s Kingdom,
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C1V15">&nbsp;</a>and saying,
<span class="wj">“The time is fulfilled, and God’s Kingdom is at hand! Repent, and believe in the Good News.”</span></div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C1V16">&nbsp;</a>Passing along by the sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew the brother of Simon casting a net into
the sea, for they were fishermen.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C1V17">&nbsp;</a>Jesus said to them,
<span class="wj">“Come after me, and I will make you into fishers for men.”</span></div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C1V18">&nbsp;</a>Immediately they left their nets, and followed him.
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C1V19">&nbsp;</a>Going on a little further from there, he saw James the son of Zebedee, and John, his brother, who were
also in the boat mending the nets.
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C1V20">&nbsp;</a>Immediately he called them, and they left their father, Zebedee, in the boat with the hired servants,
and went after him.
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C1V21">&nbsp;</a>They went into Capernaum, and immediately on the Sabbath day he entered into the synagogue and taught.
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C1V22">&nbsp;</a>They were astonished at his teaching, for he taught them as having authority, and not as the scribes.
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C1V23">&nbsp;</a>Immediately there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit, and he cried out,
 <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C1V24">&nbsp;</a>saying, “Ha! What do we have to do with you, Jesus, you Nazarene? Have you come to destroy us? I know
you who you are: the Holy One of God!”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C1V25">&nbsp;</a>Jesus rebuked him, saying,
<span class="wj">“Be quiet, and come out of him!”
</span></div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C1V26">&nbsp;</a>The unclean spirit, convulsing him and crying with a loud voice, came out of him.
 <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C1V27">&nbsp;</a>They were all amazed, so that they questioned among themselves, saying, “What is this? A new teaching?
For with authority he commands even the unclean spirits, and they obey him!”
 <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C1V28">&nbsp;</a>The report of him went out immediately everywhere into all the region of Galilee and its surrounding
area.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C1V29">&nbsp;</a>Immediately, when they had come out of the synagogue, they came into the house of Simon and Andrew, with
James and John.
 <span class="verse"> 30</span><a name="C1V30">&nbsp;</a>Now Simon’s wife’s mother lay sick with a fever, and immediately they told him about her.
 <span class="verse"> 31</span><a name="C1V31">&nbsp;</a>He came and took her by the hand, and raised her up. The fever left her, and she served them.
 <span class="verse"> 32</span><a name="C1V32">&nbsp;</a>At evening, when the sun had set, they brought to him all who were sick, and those who were possessed
by demons.
 <span class="verse"> 33</span><a name="C1V33">&nbsp;</a>All the city was gathered together at the door.
 <span class="verse"> 34</span><a name="C1V34">&nbsp;</a>He healed many who were sick with various diseases, and cast out many demons. He didn’t allow the demons
to speak, because they knew him.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 35</span><a name="C1V35">&nbsp;</a>Early in the morning, while it was still dark, he rose up and went out, and departed into a deserted
place, and prayed there.
 <span class="verse"> 36</span><a name="C1V36">&nbsp;</a>Simon and those who were with him followed after him;
 <span class="verse"> 37</span><a name="C1V37">&nbsp;</a>and they found him, and told him, “Everyone is looking for you.”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 38</span><a name="C1V38">&nbsp;</a>He said to them,
<span class="wj">“Let’s go elsewhere into the next towns, that I may preach there also, because I came out for this reason.”</span> <span class="verse"> 39</span><a name="C1V39">&nbsp;</a>He went into their synagogues throughout all Galilee, preaching and casting out demons.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 40</span><a name="C1V40">&nbsp;</a>A leper came to him, begging him, kneeling down to him, and saying to him, “If you want to, you can make
me clean.”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 41</span><a name="C1V41">&nbsp;</a>Being moved with compassion, he stretched out his hand, and touched him, and said to him,
<span class="wj">“I want to. Be made clean.”</span> <span class="verse"> 42</span><a name="C1V42">&nbsp;</a>When he had said this, immediately the leprosy departed from him, and he was made clean.
 <span class="verse"> 43</span><a name="C1V43">&nbsp;</a>He strictly warned him, and immediately sent him out,
 <span class="verse"> 44</span><a name="C1V44">&nbsp;</a>and said to him,
<span class="wj">“See you say nothing to anybody, but go show yourself to the priest, and offer for your cleansing the
things which Moses commanded, for a testimony to them.”</span></div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 45</span><a name="C1V45">&nbsp;</a>But he went out, and began to proclaim it much, and to spread about the matter, so that Jesus could no
more openly enter into a city, but was outside in desert places: and they came to him from everywhere.
