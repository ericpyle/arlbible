 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C24V1">&nbsp;</a>Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C24V2">&nbsp;</a>“Command the children of Israel, that they bring to you pure olive oil beaten for the light, to cause
a lamp to burn continually.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C24V3">&nbsp;</a>Outside of the veil of the Testimony, in the Tent of Meeting, shall Aaron keep it in order from evening
to morning before Yahweh continually: it shall be a statute forever throughout your generations.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C24V4">&nbsp;</a>He shall keep in order the lamps on the pure gold lamp stand before Yahweh continually.

<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C24V5">&nbsp;</a>“You shall take fine flour, and bake twelve cakes of it: two tenths of an ephah<a href="#FN1"><span class="notemark">*</span><span class="popup">1 ephah is about 22 liters or about 2/3 of a bushel</span></a>
 shall be in one cake.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C24V6">&nbsp;</a>You shall set them in two rows, six on a row, on the pure gold table before Yahweh.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C24V7">&nbsp;</a>You shall put pure frankincense on each row, that it may be to the bread for a memorial, even an offering
made by fire to Yahweh.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C24V8">&nbsp;</a>Every Sabbath day he shall set it in order before Yahweh continually. It is on the behalf of the children
of Israel an everlasting covenant.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C24V9">&nbsp;</a>It shall be for Aaron and his sons; and they shall eat it in a holy place: for it is most holy to him
of the offerings of Yahweh made by fire by a perpetual statute.”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C24V10">&nbsp;</a>The son of an Israelite woman, whose father was an Egyptian, went out among the children of Israel; and
the son of the Israelite woman and a man of Israel strove together in the camp.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C24V11">&nbsp;</a>The son of the Israelite woman blasphemed the Name, and cursed; and they brought him to Moses. His mother’s
name was Shelomith, the daughter of Dibri, of the tribe of Dan.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C24V12">&nbsp;</a>They put him in custody, until Yahweh’s will should be declared to them.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C24V13">&nbsp;</a>Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C24V14">&nbsp;</a>“Bring out of the camp him who cursed; and let all who heard him lay their hands on his head, and let
all the congregation stone him.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C24V15">&nbsp;</a>You shall speak to the children of Israel, saying, ‘Whoever curses his God shall bear his sin.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C24V16">&nbsp;</a>He who blasphemes Yahweh’s name, he shall surely be put to death. All the congregation shall certainly
stone him. The foreigner as well as the native-born, when he blasphemes the Name, shall be put to death.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C24V17">&nbsp;</a>“‘He who strikes any man mortally shall surely be put to death.
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C24V18">&nbsp;</a>He who strikes an animal mortally shall make it good, life for life.
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C24V19">&nbsp;</a>If anyone injures his neighbor; as he has done, so shall it be done to him:
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C24V20">&nbsp;</a>fracture for fracture, eye for eye, tooth for tooth; as he has injured someone, so shall it be done to
him.
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C24V21">&nbsp;</a>He who kills an animal shall make it good; and he who kills a man shall be put to death.
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C24V22">&nbsp;</a>You shall have one kind of law for the foreigner as well as the native-born; for I am Yahweh your God.’”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C24V23">&nbsp;</a>Moses spoke to the children of Israel; and they brought out him who had cursed out of the camp, and stoned
him with stones. The children of Israel did as Yahweh commanded Moses.
