 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C21V1">&nbsp;</a>Then David came to Nob to Ahimelech the priest. Ahimelech came to meet David trembling, and said to him,
“Why are you alone, and no man with you?”
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C21V2">&nbsp;</a>David said to Ahimelech the priest, “The king has commanded me to do something, and has said to me, ‘Let
no one know anything about the business about which I send you, and what I have commanded you. I have
sent the young men to a certain place.’
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C21V3">&nbsp;</a>Now therefore what is under your hand? Please give me five loaves of bread in my hand, or whatever is
available.”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C21V4">&nbsp;</a>The priest answered David, and said, “I have no common bread, but there is holy bread; if only the young
men have kept themselves from women.”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C21V5">&nbsp;</a>David answered the priest, and said to him, “Truly, women have been kept from us as usual these three
days. When I came out, the vessels of the young men were holy, though it was only a common journey. How
much more then today shall their vessels be holy?”
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C21V6">&nbsp;</a>So the priest gave him holy bread; for there was no bread there but the show bread that was taken from
before Yahweh, to put hot bread in the day when it was taken away.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C21V7">&nbsp;</a>Now a certain man of the servants of Saul was there that day, detained before Yahweh; and his name was
Doeg the Edomite, the best of the herdsmen who belonged to Saul.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C21V8">&nbsp;</a>David said to Ahimelech, “Isn’t there here under your hand spear or sword? For I have neither brought
my sword nor my weapons with me, because the king’s business required haste.”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C21V9">&nbsp;</a>The priest said, “Behold, the sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom you killed in the valley of Elah,
is here wrapped in a cloth behind the ephod. If you would like to take that, take it; for there is no
other except that here.”
</div>
<div class="p">David said, “There is none like that. Give it to me.”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C21V10">&nbsp;</a>David arose, and fled that day for fear of Saul, and went to Achish the king of Gath.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C21V11">&nbsp;</a>The servants of Achish said to him, “Isn’t this David the king of the land? Didn’t they sing to one another
about him in dances, saying,
</div>
<div class="q1">‘Saul has slain his thousands,
</div>
<div class="q2">and David his ten thousands?’”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C21V12">&nbsp;</a>David laid up these words in his heart, and was very afraid of Achish the king of Gath.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C21V13">&nbsp;</a>He changed his behavior before them, and pretended to be insane in their hands, and scribbled on the
doors of the gate, and let his spittle fall down on his beard.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C21V14">&nbsp;</a>Then Achish said to his servants, “Look, you see the man is insane. Why then have you brought him to
me?
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C21V15">&nbsp;</a>Do I lack madmen, that you have brought this fellow to play the madman in my presence? Should this fellow
come into my house?”
