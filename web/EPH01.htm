</div>
<div class="chapterlabel"> 1</div><div class="p">
 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C1V1">&nbsp;</a>Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus through the will of God, to the saints who are at Ephesus, and the faithful
in Christ Jesus:
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C1V2">&nbsp;</a>Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C1V3">&nbsp;</a>Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing
in the heavenly places in Christ;
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C1V4">&nbsp;</a>even as he chose us in him before the foundation of the world, that we would be holy and without defect
before him in love;
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C1V5">&nbsp;</a>having predestined us for adoption as children through Jesus Christ to himself, according to the good
pleasure of his desire,
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C1V6">&nbsp;</a>to the praise of the glory of his grace, by which he freely gave us favor in the Beloved,
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C1V7">&nbsp;</a>in whom we have our redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of our trespasses, according to the
riches of his grace,
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C1V8">&nbsp;</a>which he made to abound toward us in all wisdom and prudence,
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C1V9">&nbsp;</a>making known to us the mystery of his will, according to his good pleasure which he purposed in him
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C1V10">&nbsp;</a>to an administration of the fullness of the times, to sum up all things in Christ, the things in the
heavens, and the things on the earth, in him;
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C1V11">&nbsp;</a>in whom also we were assigned an inheritance, having been foreordained according to the purpose of him
who does all things after the counsel of his will;
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C1V12">&nbsp;</a>to the end that we should be to the praise of his glory, we who had before hoped in Christ:
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C1V13">&nbsp;</a>in whom you also, having heard the word of the truth, the Good News of your salvation—in whom, having
also believed, you were sealed with the promised Holy Spirit,
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C1V14">&nbsp;</a>who is a pledge of our inheritance, to the redemption of God’s own possession, to the praise of his glory.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C1V15">&nbsp;</a>For this cause I also, having heard of the faith in the Lord Jesus which is among you, and the love which
you have toward all the saints,
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C1V16">&nbsp;</a>don’t cease to give thanks for you, making mention of you in my prayers,
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C1V17">&nbsp;</a>that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give to you a spirit of wisdom and revelation
in the knowledge of him;
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C1V18">&nbsp;</a>having the eyes of your hearts<a href="#FN1"><span class="notemark">*</span><span class="popup">TR reads “understanding” instead of “hearts”</span></a>
 enlightened, that you may know what is the hope of his calling, and what are the riches of the glory
of his inheritance in the saints,
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C1V19">&nbsp;</a>and what is the exceeding greatness of his power toward us who believe, according to that working of
the strength of his might
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C1V20">&nbsp;</a>which he worked in Christ, when he raised him from the dead, and made him to sit at his right hand in
the heavenly places,
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C1V21">&nbsp;</a>far above all rule, and authority, and power, and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in
this age, but also in that which is to come.
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C1V22">&nbsp;</a>He put all things in subjection under his feet, and gave him to be head over all things for the assembly,
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C1V23">&nbsp;</a>which is his body, the fullness of him who fills all in all.
