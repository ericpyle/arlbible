 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C4V1">&nbsp;</a>Masters, give to your servants that which is just and equal, knowing that you also have a Master in heaven.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C4V2">&nbsp;</a>Continue steadfastly in prayer, watching therein with thanksgiving;
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C4V3">&nbsp;</a>praying together for us also, that God may open to us a door for the word, to speak the mystery of Christ,
for which I am also in bonds;
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C4V4">&nbsp;</a>that I may reveal it as I ought to speak.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C4V5">&nbsp;</a>Walk in wisdom toward those who are outside, redeeming the time.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C4V6">&nbsp;</a>Let your speech always be with grace, seasoned with salt, that you may know how you ought to answer each
one.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C4V7">&nbsp;</a>All my affairs will be made known to you by Tychicus, the beloved brother, faithful servant, and fellow
bondservant in the Lord.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C4V8">&nbsp;</a>I am sending him to you for this very purpose, that he may know your circumstances and comfort your hearts,
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C4V9">&nbsp;</a>together with Onesimus, the faithful and beloved brother, who is one of you. They will make known to
you everything that is going on here.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C4V10">&nbsp;</a>Aristarchus, my fellow prisoner, greets you, and Mark, the cousin of Barnabas (concerning whom you received
commandments, “if he comes to you, receive him”),
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C4V11">&nbsp;</a>and Jesus who is called Justus. These are my only fellow workers for God’s Kingdom who are of the circumcision,
men who have been a comfort to me.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C4V12">&nbsp;</a>Epaphras, who is one of you, a servant of Christ, salutes you, always striving for you in his prayers,
that you may stand perfect and complete in all the will of God.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C4V13">&nbsp;</a>For I testify about him, that he has great zeal for you, and for those in Laodicea, and for those in
Hierapolis.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C4V14">&nbsp;</a>Luke, the beloved physician, and Demas greet you.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C4V15">&nbsp;</a>Greet the brothers who are in Laodicea, and Nymphas, and the assembly that is in his house.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C4V16">&nbsp;</a>When this letter has been read among you, cause it to be read also in the assembly of the Laodiceans;
and that you also read the letter from Laodicea.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C4V17">&nbsp;</a>Tell Archippus, “Take heed to the ministry which you have received in the Lord, that you fulfill it.”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C4V18">&nbsp;</a>The salutation of me, Paul, with my own hand: remember my bonds. Grace be with you. Amen.
