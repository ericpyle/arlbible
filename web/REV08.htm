 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C8V1">&nbsp;</a>When he opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven for about half an hour.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C8V2">&nbsp;</a>I saw the seven angels who stand before God, and seven trumpets were given to them.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C8V3">&nbsp;</a>Another angel came and stood over the altar, having a golden censer. Much incense was given to him, that
he should add it to the prayers of all the saints on the golden altar which was before the throne.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C8V4">&nbsp;</a>The smoke of the incense, with the prayers of the saints, went up before God out of the angel’s hand.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C8V5">&nbsp;</a>The angel took the censer, and he filled it with the fire of the altar, and threw it on the earth. There
followed thunders, sounds, lightnings, and an earthquake.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C8V6">&nbsp;</a>The seven angels who had the seven trumpets prepared themselves to sound.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C8V7">&nbsp;</a>The first sounded, and there followed hail and fire, mixed with blood, and they were thrown to the earth.
One third of the earth was burned up,
<a href="#FN1"><span class="notemark">*</span><span class="popup">TR omits “One third of the earth was burned up”</span></a>
 and one third of the trees were burned up, and all green grass was burned up.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C8V8">&nbsp;</a>The second angel sounded, and something like a great burning mountain was thrown into the sea. One third
of the sea became blood,
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C8V9">&nbsp;</a>and one third of the living creatures which were in the sea died. One third of the ships were destroyed.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C8V10">&nbsp;</a>The third angel sounded, and a great star fell from the sky, burning like a torch, and it fell on one
third of the rivers, and on the springs of the waters.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C8V11">&nbsp;</a>The name of the star is called “Wormwood.” One third of the waters became wormwood. Many people died
from the waters, because they were made bitter.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C8V12">&nbsp;</a>The fourth angel sounded, and one third of the sun was struck, and one third of the moon, and one third
of the stars; so that one third of them would be darkened, and the day wouldn’t shine for one third of
it, and the night in the same way.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C8V13">&nbsp;</a>I saw, and I heard an eagle,<a href="#FN2"><span class="notemark">†</span><span class="popup">TR reads “angel” instead of “eagle”
</span></a>
 flying in mid heaven, saying with a loud voice, “Woe! Woe! Woe for those who dwell on the earth, because
of the other voices of the trumpets of the three angels, who are yet to sound!”
