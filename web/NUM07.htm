These are they who were over those who were counted:

two of the princes, and for each one an ox: and they presented them before the tabernacle.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C7V4">&nbsp;</a>Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C7V5">&nbsp;</a>“Accept these from them, that they may be used in doing the service of the Tent of Meeting; and you shall
