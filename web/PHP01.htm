<div class="chapterlabel"> 1</div><div class="p">
 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C1V1">&nbsp;</a>Paul and Timothy, servants of Jesus Christ;
</div>
<div class="p">To all the saints in Christ Jesus who are at Philippi, with the overseers
<a href="#FN1"><span class="notemark">*</span><span class="popup">or, superintendents, or bishops</span></a>
 and servants<a href="#FN2"><span class="notemark">†</span><span class="popup">Or, deacons</span></a>
:
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C1V2">&nbsp;</a>Grace to you, and peace from God, our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C1V3">&nbsp;</a>I thank my God whenever I remember you,
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C1V4">&nbsp;</a>always in every request of mine on behalf of you all, making my requests with joy,
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C1V5">&nbsp;</a>for your partnership<a href="#FN3"><span class="notemark">‡</span><span class="popup">The word translated “partnership” (koinonia) also means “fellowship” and “sharing”.</span></a>
 in furtherance of the Good News from the first day until now;
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C1V6">&nbsp;</a>being confident of this very thing, that he who began a good work in you will complete it until the day
of Jesus Christ.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C1V7">&nbsp;</a>It is even right for me to think this way on behalf of all of you, because I have you in my heart, because,
both in my bonds and in the defense and confirmation of the Good News, you all are partakers with me
of grace.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C1V8">&nbsp;</a>For God is my witness, how I long after all of you in the tender mercies of Christ Jesus.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C1V9">&nbsp;</a>This I pray, that your love may abound yet more and more in knowledge and all discernment;
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C1V10">&nbsp;</a>so that you may approve the things that are excellent; that you may be sincere and without offense to
the day of Christ;
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C1V11">&nbsp;</a>being filled with the fruits of righteousness, which are through Jesus Christ, to the glory and praise
of God.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C1V12">&nbsp;</a>Now I desire to have you know, brothers,<a href="#FN4"><span class="notemark">§</span><span class="popup">The word for “brothers” here and where context allows may also be correctly translated “brothers and
sisters” or “siblings.”</span></a>
 that the things which happened to me have turned out rather to the progress of the Good News;
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C1V13">&nbsp;</a>so that it became evident to the whole palace<a href="#FN5"><span class="notemark">**</span><span class="popup">or, praetorian
</span></a>
 guard, and to all the rest, that my bonds are in Christ;
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C1V14">&nbsp;</a>and that most of the brothers in the Lord, being confident through my bonds, are more abundantly bold
to speak the word of God without fear.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C1V15">&nbsp;</a>Some indeed preach Christ even out of envy and strife, and some also out of good will.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C1V16">&nbsp;</a>The former insincerely preach Christ from selfish ambition, thinking that they add affliction to my chains;
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C1V17">&nbsp;</a>but the latter out of love, knowing that I am appointed for the defense of the Good News.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C1V18">&nbsp;</a>What does it matter? Only that in every way, whether in pretense or in truth, Christ is proclaimed. I
rejoice in this, yes, and will rejoice.
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C1V19">&nbsp;</a>For I know that this will turn out to my salvation, through your supplication and the supply of the Spirit
of Jesus Christ,
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C1V20">&nbsp;</a>according to my earnest expectation and hope, that I will in no way be disappointed, but with all boldness,
as always, now also Christ will be magnified in my body, whether by life, or by death.
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C1V21">&nbsp;</a>For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain.
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C1V22">&nbsp;</a>But if I live on in the flesh, this will bring fruit from my work; yet I don’t know what I will choose.
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C1V23">&nbsp;</a>But I am in a dilemma between the two, having the desire to depart and be with Christ, which is far better.
 <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C1V24">&nbsp;</a>Yet, to remain in the flesh is more needful for your sake.
 <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C1V25">&nbsp;</a>Having this confidence, I know that I will remain, yes, and remain with you all, for your progress and
joy in the faith,
 <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C1V26">&nbsp;</a>that your rejoicing may abound in Christ Jesus in me through my presence with you again.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C1V27">&nbsp;</a>Only let your way of life be worthy of the Good News of Christ, that, whether I come and see you or am
absent, I may hear of your state, that you stand firm in one spirit, with one soul striving for the faith
of the Good News;
 <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C1V28">&nbsp;</a>and in nothing frightened by the adversaries, which is for them a proof of destruction, but to you of
salvation, and that from God.
 <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C1V29">&nbsp;</a>Because it has been granted to you on behalf of Christ, not only to believe in him, but also to suffer
on his behalf,
 <span class="verse"> 30</span><a name="C1V30">&nbsp;</a>having the same conflict which you saw in me, and now hear is in me.
