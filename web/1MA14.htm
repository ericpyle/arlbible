 the hundred and seventy and second year king Demetrius gathered his forces together, and went into Media,
to get him help, that he might fight against Tryphon.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C14V2">&nbsp;</a>And Arsaces, the king of Persia and Media, heard that Demetrius was come into his borders, and he sent
one of his princes to take him alive:

in ward.

the citadel, and he took away from it its uncleannesses; and there was none that resisted him.

for their coming,

came to us to renew the friendship they had with us.
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C14V23">&nbsp;</a>And it pleased the people to entertain the men honorably, and to put the copy of their words in the

wrote a copy of these things to Simon the high priest.

 was it notified to us:
 <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C14V29">&nbsp;</a>Forasmuch as oftentimes there have been wars in the country, but Simon the son of Mattathias, the son
of the sons of Joarib, and his brethren, put themselves in jeopardy, and withstood the enemies of their
nation, that their sanctuary and the law might be established, and glorified their nation with great
glory:
 <span class="verse"> 30</span><a name="C14V30">&nbsp;</a>and Jonathan assembled their nation together, and became their high priest, and was gathered to his people:
 <span class="verse"> 31</span><a name="C14V31">&nbsp;</a>and their enemies purposed to invade their country, that they might destroy their country utterly, and
stretch forth their hands against their sanctuary:
 <span class="verse"> 32</span><a name="C14V32">&nbsp;</a>then rose up Simon, and fought for his nation, and spent much of his own substance, and armed the valiant
men of his nation, and gave them wages:
 <span class="verse"> 33</span><a name="C14V33">&nbsp;</a>and he fortified the cities of Judaea, and Bethsura that lies upon the borders of Judaea, where the arms
of the enemies were aforetime, and set there a garrison of Jews:
 <span class="verse"> 34</span><a name="C14V34">&nbsp;</a>and he fortified Joppa which is upon the sea, and Gazara which is upon the borders of Azotus, wherein
the enemies lived aforetime, and placed Jews there, and set therein all things convenient for the reparation
thereof:

 faith of Simon, and the glory which he thought to bring to his nation, and they made him their leader
and high priest, because he had done all these things, and for the justice and the faith which he kept
to his nation, and for that he sought by all means to exalt his people:
 <span class="verse"> 36</span><a name="C14V36">&nbsp;</a>and in his days things prospered in his hands, so that the Gentiles were taken away out of their country,
and they also that were in the city of David, they that were in Jerusalem, who had made themselves a
citadel, out of which they issued, and polluted all things round about the sanctuary, and did great hurt
to its purity;
 <span class="verse"> 37</span><a name="C14V37">&nbsp;</a>and he placed Jews therein, and fortified it for the safety of the country and the city, and made high
the walls of Jerusalem:
 <span class="verse"> 38</span><a name="C14V38">&nbsp;</a>and king Demetrius confirmed to him the high priesthood according to these things,

 <span class="verse"> 40</span><a name="C14V40">&nbsp;</a>for he had heard say, that the Jews had been called by the Romans friends and confederates and brethren,
and that they had met the ambassadors of Simon honorably;
 <span class="verse"> 41</span><a name="C14V41">&nbsp;</a>and that the Jews and the priests were well pleased that Simon should be their leader and high priest
for ever, until there should arise a faithful prophet;
 <span class="verse"> 42</span><a name="C14V42">&nbsp;</a>and that he should be captain over them, and should take charge of the sanctuary, to set them over their
works, and over the country, and over the arms, and over the strongholds; and that he should take charge
of the sanctuary,
 <span class="verse"> 43</span><a name="C14V43">&nbsp;</a>and that he should be obeyed by all, and that all instruments in the country should be written in his
name, and that he should be clothed in purple, and wear gold;
 <span class="verse"> 44</span><a name="C14V44">&nbsp;</a>and that it should not be lawful for any of the people or of the priests to set at nothing any of these
things, or to gainsay the words that he should speak, or to gather an assembly in the country without
him, or to be clothed in purple, or wear a buckle of gold;
 <span class="verse"> 45</span><a name="C14V45">&nbsp;</a>but whoever should do otherwise, or set at nothing any of these things, he should be liable to punishment.
 <span class="verse"> 46</span><a name="C14V46">&nbsp;</a>All the people consented to ordain for Simon that he should do according to these words;
