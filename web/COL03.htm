 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C3V1">&nbsp;</a>If then you were raised together with Christ, seek the things that are above, where Christ is, seated
on the right hand of God.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C3V2">&nbsp;</a>Set your mind on the things that are above, not on the things that are on the earth.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C3V3">&nbsp;</a>For you died, and your life is hidden with Christ in God.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C3V4">&nbsp;</a>When Christ, our life, is revealed, then you will also be revealed with him in glory.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C3V5">&nbsp;</a>Put to death therefore your members which are on the earth: sexual immorality, uncleanness, depraved
passion, evil desire, and covetousness, which is idolatry;
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C3V6">&nbsp;</a>for which things’ sake the wrath of God comes on the children of disobedience.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C3V7">&nbsp;</a>You also once walked in those, when you lived in them;
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C3V8">&nbsp;</a>but now you also put them all away: anger, wrath, malice, slander, and shameful speaking out of your
mouth.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C3V9">&nbsp;</a>Don’t lie to one another, seeing that you have put off the old man with his doings,
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C3V10">&nbsp;</a>and have put on the new man, who is being renewed in knowledge after the image of his Creator,
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C3V11">&nbsp;</a>where there can’t be Greek and Jew, circumcision and uncircumcision, barbarian, Scythian, bondservant,
freeman; but Christ is all, and in all.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C3V12">&nbsp;</a>Put on therefore, as God’s chosen ones, holy and beloved, a heart of compassion, kindness, lowliness,
humility, and perseverance;
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C3V13">&nbsp;</a>bearing with one another, and forgiving each other, if any man has a complaint against any; even as Christ
forgave you, so you also do.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C3V14">&nbsp;</a>Above all these things, walk in love, which is the bond of perfection.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C3V15">&nbsp;</a>And let the peace of God rule in your hearts, to which also you were called in one body; and be thankful.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C3V16">&nbsp;</a>Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly; in all wisdom teaching and admonishing one another with psalms,
hymns, and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your heart to the Lord.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C3V17">&nbsp;</a>Whatever you do, in word or in deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father,
through him.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C3V18">&nbsp;</a>Wives, be in subjection to your husbands, as is fitting in the Lord.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C3V19">&nbsp;</a>Husbands, love your wives, and don’t be bitter against them.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C3V20">&nbsp;</a>Children, obey your parents in all things, for this pleases the Lord.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C3V21">&nbsp;</a>Fathers, don’t provoke your children, so that they won’t be discouraged.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C3V22">&nbsp;</a>Servants, obey in all things those who are your masters according to the flesh, not just when they are
looking, as men pleasers, but in singleness of heart, fearing God.
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C3V23">&nbsp;</a>And whatever you do, work heartily, as for the Lord, and not for men,
 <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C3V24">&nbsp;</a>knowing that from the Lord you will receive the reward of the inheritance; for you serve the Lord Christ.
 <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C3V25">&nbsp;</a>But he who does wrong will receive again for the wrong that he has done, and there is no partiality.
