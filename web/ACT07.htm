 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C7V1">&nbsp;</a>The high priest said, “Are these things so?”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C7V2">&nbsp;</a>He said, “Brothers and fathers, listen. The God of glory appeared to our father Abraham, when he was
in Mesopotamia, before he lived in Haran,
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C7V3">&nbsp;</a>and said to him, ‘Get out of your land, and from your relatives, and come into a land which I will show
you.’<a href="#FN1"><span class="notemark"></span><span class="popup">+ Genesis 12:1</span></a>
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C7V4">&nbsp;</a>Then he came out of the land of the Chaldaeans, and lived in Haran. From there, when his father was dead,
God moved him into this land, where you are now living.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C7V5">&nbsp;</a>He gave him no inheritance in it, no, not so much as to set his foot on. He promised that he would give
it to him for a possession, and to his offspring<a href="#FN2"><span class="notemark">*</span><span class="popup">or, seed</span></a>
 after him, when he still had no child.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C7V6">&nbsp;</a>God spoke in this way: that his offspring<a href="#FN3"><span class="notemark">†</span><span class="popup">or, seed</span></a>
 would live as aliens in a strange land, and that they would be enslaved and mistreated for four hundred
years.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C7V7">&nbsp;</a>‘I will judge the nation to which they will be in bondage,’ said God, ‘and after that will they come
out, and serve me in this place.’<a href="#FN4"><span class="notemark"></span><span class="popup">+ Genesis 15:13-14</span></a>
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C7V8">&nbsp;</a>He gave him the covenant of circumcision. So Abraham became the father of Isaac, and circumcised him
the eighth day. Isaac became the father of Jacob, and Jacob became the father of the twelve patriarchs.

He made him governor over Egypt and all his house.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C7V11">&nbsp;</a>Now a famine came over all the land of Egypt and Canaan, and great affliction. Our fathers found no food.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C7V12">&nbsp;</a>But when Jacob heard that there was grain in Egypt, he sent out our fathers the first time.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C7V13">&nbsp;</a>On the second time Joseph was made known to his brothers, and Joseph’s race was revealed to Pharaoh.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C7V14">&nbsp;</a>Joseph sent, and summoned Jacob, his father, and all his relatives, seventy-five souls.

from the children of Hamor of Shechem.

 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C7V19">&nbsp;</a>The same took advantage of our race, and mistreated our fathers, and forced them to throw out their babies,
so that they wouldn’t stay alive.
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C7V20">&nbsp;</a>At that time Moses was born, and was exceedingly handsome. He was nourished three months in his father’s
house.

didn’t understand.

‘Sirs, you are brothers. Why do you wrong one another?’

 <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C7V29">&nbsp;</a>Moses fled at this saying, and became a stranger in the land of Midian, where he became the father of
two sons.

in a flame of fire in a bush.
 <span class="verse"> 31</span><a name="C7V31">&nbsp;</a>When Moses saw it, he wondered at the sight. As he came close to see, a voice of the Lord came to him,

 Moses trembled, and dared not look.
 <span class="verse"> 33</span><a name="C7V33">&nbsp;</a>The Lord said to him, ‘Take your sandals off of your feet, for the place where you stand is holy ground.
 <span class="verse"> 34</span><a name="C7V34">&nbsp;</a>I have surely seen the affliction of my people that is in Egypt, and have heard their groaning. I have
come down to deliver them. Now come, I will send you into Egypt.’<a href="#FN8"><span class="notemark"></span><span class="popup">+ Exodus 3:5,7-8,10</span></a>

a ruler and a deliverer by the hand of the angel who appeared to him in the bush.
 <span class="verse"> 36</span><a name="C7V36">&nbsp;</a>This man led them out, having worked wonders and signs in Egypt, in the Red Sea, and in the wilderness
for forty years.
 <span class="verse"> 37</span><a name="C7V37">&nbsp;</a>This is that Moses, who said to the children of Israel, ‘The Lord our God will raise up a prophet for

and with our fathers, who received living revelations to give to us,
