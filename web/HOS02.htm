<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C2V2">&nbsp;</a>Contend with your mother!
</div>
<div class="q2">Contend, for she is not my wife,

<div class="q2">neither am I her husband;
</div>
<div class="q1">and let her put away her prostitution from her face,
</div>
<div class="q2">and her adulteries from between her breasts;
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C2V3">&nbsp;</a>Lest I strip her naked,

<div class="q2">and make her bare as in the day that she was born,

<div class="q1">and make her like a wilderness,
</div>
<div class="q2">and set her like a dry land,
</div>
<div class="q2">and kill her with thirst.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C2V4">&nbsp;</a>Indeed, on her children I will have no mercy;

<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C2V5">&nbsp;</a>For their mother has played the prostitute.
</div>
<div class="q2">She who conceived them has done shamefully;
</div>
<div class="q1">for she said, ‘I will go after my lovers,
</div>
<div class="q2">who give me my bread and my water,
</div>
<div class="q2">my wool and my flax,
</div>
<div class="q2">my oil and my drink.’

 I will hedge up your way with thorns,
</div>
<div class="q2">and I will build a wall against her,
</div>
<div class="q2">that she can’t find her way.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C2V7">&nbsp;</a>She will follow after her lovers,

<div class="q2">but won’t find them.
</div>
<div class="q1">Then she will say, ‘I will go and return to my first husband;
</div>
<div class="q2">for then was it better with me than now.’
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C2V8">&nbsp;</a>For she did not know that I gave her the grain, the new wine, and the oil,
</div>
<div class="q2">and multiplied to her silver and gold, which they used for Baal.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C2V9">&nbsp;</a>Therefore I will take back my grain in its time,
</div>
<div class="q2">and my new wine in its season,

</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C2V10">&nbsp;</a>Now I will uncover her lewdness in the sight of her lovers,

<div class="q2">and no one will deliver her out of my hand.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C2V11">&nbsp;</a>I will also cause all her celebrations to cease:
</div>
<div class="q2">her feasts, her new moons, her Sabbaths, and all her solemn assemblies.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C2V12">&nbsp;</a>I will lay waste her vines and her fig trees,
</div>
<div class="q2">about which she has said, ‘These are my wages that my lovers have given me;
</div>
<div class="q2">and I will make them a forest,’
</div>
<div class="q2">and the animals of the field shall eat them.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C2V13">&nbsp;</a>I will visit on her the days of the Baals,

<div class="q2">to which she burned incense,
</div>
<div class="q1">when she decked herself with her earrings and her jewels,
</div>
<div class="q2">and went after her lovers,
</div>
<div class="q2">and forgot me,” says Yahweh.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C2V14">&nbsp;</a>“Therefore behold, I will allure her,

<div class="q2">and bring her into the wilderness,
</div>
<div class="q2">and speak tenderly to her.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C2V15">&nbsp;</a>I will give her vineyards from there,
</div>
<div class="q2">and the valley of Achor for a door of hope;
</div>
<div class="q1">and she will respond there,
</div>
<div class="q2">as in the days of her youth,
</div>
<div class="q2">and as in the day when she came up out of the land of Egypt.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C2V16">&nbsp;</a>It will be in that day,” says Yahweh,
</div>
<div class="q2">“that you will call me ‘my husband,’
</div>
<div class="q2">and no longer call me ‘my master.’
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C2V17">&nbsp;</a>For I will take away the names of the Baals out of her mouth,
</div>
<div class="q2">and they will no longer be mentioned by name.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C2V18">&nbsp;</a>In that day I will make a covenant for them with the animals of the field,
</div>
<div class="q2">and with the birds of the sky,
</div>
<div class="q2">and with the creeping things of the ground.
</div>
<div class="q1">I will break the bow, the sword, and the battle out of the land,
</div>
<div class="q2">and will make them lie down safely.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C2V19">&nbsp;</a>I will betroth you to me forever.
</div>
<div class="q2">Yes, I will betroth you to me in righteousness, in justice, in loving kindness, and in compassion.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C2V20">&nbsp;</a>I will even betroth you to me in faithfulness;
</div>
<div class="q2">and you shall know Yahweh.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C2V21">&nbsp;</a>It will happen in that day, I will respond,” says Yahweh,
</div>
<div class="q2">“I will respond to the heavens,
</div>
<div class="q2">and they will respond to the earth;
</div>
<div class="q2"> <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C2V22">&nbsp;</a>and the earth will respond to the grain, and the new wine, and the oil;
</div>
<div class="q2">and they will respond to Jezreel.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C2V23">&nbsp;</a>I will sow her to me in the earth;
</div>
<div class="q2">and I will have mercy on her who had not obtained mercy;

<div class="q2">and I will tell those who were not my people, ‘You are my people;’
</div>
<div class="q2">and they will say, ‘My God!’”
