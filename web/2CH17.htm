 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C17V1">&nbsp;</a>Jehoshaphat his son reigned in his place, and strengthened himself against Israel.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C17V2">&nbsp;</a>He placed forces in all the fortified cities of Judah, and set garrisons in the land of Judah, and in
the cities of Ephraim, which Asa his father had taken.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C17V3">&nbsp;</a>Yahweh was with Jehoshaphat, because he walked in the first ways of his father David, and didn’t seek
the Baals,
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C17V4">&nbsp;</a>but sought to the God of his father, and walked in his commandments, and not in the ways of Israel.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C17V5">&nbsp;</a>Therefore Yahweh established the kingdom in his hand. All Judah brought tribute to Jehoshaphat, and he
had riches and honor in abundance.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C17V6">&nbsp;</a>His heart was lifted up in the ways of Yahweh. Furthermore, he took away the high places and the Asherah
poles out of Judah.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C17V7">&nbsp;</a>Also in the third year of his reign he sent his princes, even Ben Hail, Obadiah, Zechariah, Nethanel,
and Micaiah, to teach in the cities of Judah;
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C17V8">&nbsp;</a>and with them the Levites, even Shemaiah, Nethaniah, Zebadiah, Asahel, Shemiramoth, Jehonathan, Adonijah,
Tobijah, and Tobadonijah, the Levites; and with them Elishama and Jehoram, the priests.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C17V9">&nbsp;</a>They taught in Judah, having the book of Yahweh’s law with them. They went about throughout all the cities
of Judah and taught among the people.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C17V10">&nbsp;</a>The fear of Yahweh fell on all the kingdoms of the lands that were around Judah, so that they made no
war against Jehoshaphat.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C17V11">&nbsp;</a>Some of the Philistines brought Jehoshaphat presents and silver for tribute. The Arabians also brought
him flocks, seven thousand seven hundred rams, and seven thousand seven hundred male goats.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C17V12">&nbsp;</a>Jehoshaphat grew great exceedingly; and he built fortresses and store cities in Judah.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C17V13">&nbsp;</a>He had many works in the cities of Judah; and men of war, mighty men of valor, in Jerusalem.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C17V14">&nbsp;</a>This was the numbering of them according to their fathers’ houses: From Judah, the captains of thousands:
Adnah the captain, and with him three hundred thousand mighty men of valor;
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C17V15">&nbsp;</a>and next to him Jehohanan the captain, and with him two hundred eighty thousand;
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C17V16">&nbsp;</a>and next to him Amasiah the son of Zichri, who willingly offered himself to Yahweh, and with him two
hundred thousand mighty men of valor.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C17V17">&nbsp;</a>From Benjamin: Eliada, a mighty man of valor, and with him two hundred thousand armed with bow and shield;
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C17V18">&nbsp;</a>and next to him Jehozabad, and with him one hundred eighty thousand ready and prepared for war.
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C17V19">&nbsp;</a>These were those who waited on the king, besides those whom the king put in the fortified cities throughout
all Judah.
