 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C23V1">&nbsp;</a>“Woe to the shepherds who destroy and scatter the sheep of my pasture!” says Yahweh.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C23V2">&nbsp;</a>Therefore Yahweh, the God of Israel, says against the shepherds who feed my people: “You have scattered
my flock, driven them away, and have not visited them. Behold, I will visit on you the evil of your doings,”
says Yahweh.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C23V3">&nbsp;</a>“I will gather the remnant of my flock out of all the countries where I have driven them, and will bring
them again to their folds; and they will be fruitful and multiply.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C23V4">&nbsp;</a>I will set up shepherds over them, who will feed them. They will no longer be afraid or dismayed, neither
will any be lacking,” says Yahweh.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C23V5">&nbsp;</a>“Behold, the days come,” says Yahweh,
</div>
<div class="q2">“that I will raise to David a righteous Branch,
</div>
<div class="q1">and he will reign as king and deal wisely,
</div>
<div class="q2">and will execute justice and righteousness in the land.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C23V6">&nbsp;</a>In his days Judah will be saved,
</div>
<div class="q2">and Israel will dwell safely.
</div>
<div class="q1">This is his name by which he will be called:
</div>
<div class="q2">Yahweh our righteousness.
</div>
<div class="m"> <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C23V7">&nbsp;</a>“Therefore behold, the days come,” says Yahweh, “that they will no more say, ‘As Yahweh lives, who brought
up the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt;’
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C23V8">&nbsp;</a>but, ‘As Yahweh lives, who brought up and who led the offspring<a href="#FN1"><span class="notemark">*</span><span class="popup">or, seed</span></a>
 of the house of Israel out of the north country, and from all the countries where I had driven them.’
Then they will dwell in their own land.”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C23V9">&nbsp;</a>Concerning the prophets:
</div>
<div class="q1">My heart within me is broken.
</div>
<div class="q2">All my bones shake.
</div>
<div class="q1">I am like a drunken man,
</div>
<div class="q2">and like a man whom wine has overcome,
</div>
<div class="q1">because of Yahweh,
</div>
<div class="q2">and because of his holy words.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C23V10">&nbsp;</a>For the land is full of adulterers;
</div>
<div class="q2">for because of the curse the land mourns.
</div>
<div class="q1">The pastures of the wilderness have dried up.
</div>
<div class="q2">Their course is evil,
</div>
<div class="q2">and their might is not right;
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C23V11">&nbsp;</a>for both prophet and priest are profane.
</div>
<div class="q2">Yes, in my house I have found their wickedness,” says Yahweh.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C23V12">&nbsp;</a>Therefore their way will be to them as slippery places in the darkness.
</div>
<div class="q2">They will be driven on,
</div>
<div class="q2">and fall therein;
</div>
<div class="q1">for I will bring evil on them,
</div>
<div class="q2">even the year of their visitation,” says Yahweh.
</div>
<div class="b"></div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C23V13">&nbsp;</a>“I have seen folly in the prophets of Samaria.
</div>
<div class="q2">They prophesied by Baal,
</div>
<div class="q2">and caused my people Israel to err.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C23V14">&nbsp;</a>In the prophets of Jerusalem I have also seen a horrible thing:
</div>
<div class="q2">they commit adultery and walk in lies.
</div>
<div class="q1">They strengthen the hands of evildoers,
</div>
<div class="q2">so that no one returns from his wickedness.
</div>
<div class="q1">They have all become to me as Sodom,
</div>
<div class="q2">and its inhabitants as Gomorrah.”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C23V15">&nbsp;</a>Therefore Yahweh of Armies says concerning the prophets:
</div>
<div class="q1">“Behold, I will feed them with wormwood,
</div>
<div class="q2">and make them drink the water of gall;
</div>
<div class="q2">for from the prophets of Jerusalem ungodliness has gone out into all the land.”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C23V16">&nbsp;</a>Yahweh of Armies says,
</div>
<div class="q1">“Don’t listen to the words of the prophets who prophesy to you.
</div>
<div class="q2">They teach you vanity.
</div>
<div class="q2">They speak a vision of their own heart,
</div>
<div class="q2">and not out of the mouth of Yahweh.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C23V17">&nbsp;</a>They say continually to those who despise me,
</div>
<div class="q2">‘Yahweh has said, “You will have peace;”’
</div>
<div class="q1">and to everyone who walks in the stubbornness of his own heart they say,
</div>
<div class="q2">‘No evil will come on you.’
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C23V18">&nbsp;</a>For who has stood in the council of Yahweh,
</div>
<div class="q2">that he should perceive and hear his word?
</div>
<div class="q2">Who has listend to my word, and heard it?
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C23V19">&nbsp;</a>Behold, Yahweh’s storm, his wrath, has gone out.
</div>
<div class="q2">Yes, a whirling storm:
</div>
<div class="q2">It will burst on the head of the wicked.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C23V20">&nbsp;</a>Yahweh’s anger will not return until he has executed,
</div>
<div class="q2">and until he has performed the intents of his heart.
</div>
<div class="q2">In the latter days, you will understand it perfectly.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C23V21">&nbsp;</a>I didn’t send these prophets, yet they ran.
</div>
<div class="q2">I didn’t speak to them, yet they prophesied.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C23V22">&nbsp;</a>But if they had stood in my council,
</div>
<div class="q2">then they would have caused my people to hear my words,
</div>
<div class="q1">and would have turned them from their evil way,
</div>
<div class="q2">and from the evil of their doings.
</div>
<div class="b"></div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C23V23">&nbsp;</a>“Am I a God at hand,” says Yahweh,
</div>
<div class="q2">“and not a God afar off?
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C23V24">&nbsp;</a>Can anyone hide himself in secret places
</div>
<div class="q2">so that I can’t see him?” says Yahweh.
</div>
<div class="q2">“Don’t I fill heaven and earth?” says Yahweh.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C23V25">&nbsp;</a>“I have heard what the prophets have said, who prophesy lies in my name, saying, ‘I had a dream! I had
a dream!’
 <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C23V26">&nbsp;</a>How long will this be in the heart of the prophets who prophesy lies, even the prophets of the deceit
of their own heart?
 <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C23V27">&nbsp;</a>They intend to cause my people to forget my name by their dreams which they each tell his neighbor, as
their fathers forgot my name because of Baal.
 <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C23V28">&nbsp;</a>The prophet who has a dream, let him tell a dream; and he who has my word, let him speak my word faithfully.
What is the straw to the wheat?” says Yahweh.
 <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C23V29">&nbsp;</a>“Isn’t my word like fire?” says Yahweh; “and like a hammer that breaks the rock in pieces?
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 30</span><a name="C23V30">&nbsp;</a>“Therefore behold, I am against the prophets,” says Yahweh, “who each steal my words from his neighbor.
 <span class="verse"> 31</span><a name="C23V31">&nbsp;</a>Behold, I am against the prophets,” says Yahweh, “who use their tongues, and say, ‘He says.’
 <span class="verse"> 32</span><a name="C23V32">&nbsp;</a>Behold, I am against those who prophesy lying dreams,” says Yahweh, “who tell them, and cause my people
to err by their lies, and by their vain boasting; yet I didn’t send them or command them. They don’t
profit this people at all,” says Yahweh.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 33</span><a name="C23V33">&nbsp;</a>“When this people, or the prophet, or a priest, asks you, saying, ‘What is the message from Yahweh?’
Then you shall tell them, ‘“What message? I will cast you off,” says Yahweh.’
 <span class="verse"> 34</span><a name="C23V34">&nbsp;</a>As for the prophet, the priest, and the people, who say, ‘The message from Yahweh,’ I will even punish
that man and his household.
 <span class="verse"> 35</span><a name="C23V35">&nbsp;</a>You will say everyone to his neighbor, and everyone to his brother, ‘What has Yahweh answered?’ and,
‘What has Yahweh said?’
 <span class="verse"> 36</span><a name="C23V36">&nbsp;</a>You will mention the message from Yahweh no more: for every man’s own word has become his message; for
you have perverted the words of the living God, of Yahweh of Armies, our God.
 <span class="verse"> 37</span><a name="C23V37">&nbsp;</a>You will say to the prophet, ‘What has Yahweh answered you?’ and, ‘What has Yahweh spoken?’
 <span class="verse"> 38</span><a name="C23V38">&nbsp;</a>Although you say, ‘The message from Yahweh;’ therefore Yahweh says: ‘Because you say this word, “The
message from Yahweh,” and I have sent to you, telling you not to say, “The message from Yahweh;”
 <span class="verse"> 39</span><a name="C23V39">&nbsp;</a>therefore, behold, I will utterly forget you, and I will cast you off, and the city that I gave to you
and to your fathers, away from my presence.
 <span class="verse"> 40</span><a name="C23V40">&nbsp;</a>I will bring an everlasting reproach on you, and a perpetual shame, which will not be forgotten.’”
