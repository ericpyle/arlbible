 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C6V1">&nbsp;</a>Now as they went on their journey, they came at eventide to the river Tigris, and they lodged there.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C6V2">&nbsp;</a>But the young man went down to wash himself, and a fish leaped out of the river, and would have swallowed
up the young man.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C6V3">&nbsp;</a>But the angel said to him, Take hold on the fish. And the young man caught hold of the fish, and cast
it up on the land.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C6V4">&nbsp;</a>And the angel said to him, Cut the fish open, and take the heart and the liver and the gall, and put
them up safely.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C6V5">&nbsp;</a>And the young man did as the angel commanded him; but they roasted the fish, and ate it. And they both
went on their way, till they drew near to Ecbatana.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C6V6">&nbsp;</a>And the young man said to the angel, Brother Azarias, to what use is the heart and the liver and the
gall of the fish?
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C6V7">&nbsp;</a>And he said to him, Touching the heart and the liver, if a

 devil or an evil spirit trouble any, we must make a smoke thereof before the man or the woman, and the
party shall be no more vexed.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C6V8">&nbsp;</a>But as for the gall,
<span class="add">it is good
</span> to anoint a man that has white films in his eyes, and he shall be healed.

<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C6V9">&nbsp;</a>But when they drew near to Rages,
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C6V10">&nbsp;</a>the angel said to the young man, Brother, today we shall lodge with Raguel, and he is your kinsman; and
he has an only daughter, named Sarah. I will speak for her, that she should be given you for a wife.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C6V11">&nbsp;</a>For to you does the inheritance of her appertain, and you only are of her kindred:
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C6V12">&nbsp;</a>and the maid is fair and wise. And now hear me, and I will speak to her father; and when we return from
Rages we will celebrate the marriage: for I know that Raguel may in no wise marry her to another according
to the law of Moses, or else he shall be liable to death, because it appertains to you to take the inheritance,
rather than any other.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C6V13">&nbsp;</a>Then the young man said to the angel, Brother Azarias, I have heard that this maid has been given to
seven men, and that they all perished in the bride-chamber.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C6V14">&nbsp;</a>And now I am the only son of my father, and I am afraid, lest I go in and die, even as those before me:
for a

</span></a>
 devil loves her, which hurts no man, but those which come to her: and now I fear lest I die, and bring
my father’s and my mother’s life to the grave with sorrow because of me: and they have no other son to
bury them.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C6V15">&nbsp;</a>But the angel said to him, Do you not remember the words which your father commanded you, that you should
take a wife of your own kindred? and now hear me, brother; for she shall be your wife; and make you no
reckoning of the devil; for this night shall she be given you to wife.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C6V16">&nbsp;</a>And
<a href="#FN3"><span class="notemark">‡</span><span class="popup">Gr.
if.
</span></a>
 when you shall come into the bride-chamber, you shall take the ashes of incense, and shall lay upon
them some of the heart and liver of the fish, and shall make a smoke
<span class="add">therewith:
</span> <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C6V17">&nbsp;</a>and the devil shall smell it, and flee away, and never come again any more. But when you go near to her,
rise up both of you, and cry to God which is merciful, and he shall save you, and have mercy on you.
Fear not, for she was prepared for you from the beginning; and you shall save her, and she shall go with
you. And I suppose that you shall have children of her. And when Tobias heard these things, he loved
her, and his soul clave to her exceedingly.
