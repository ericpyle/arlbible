<div class="chapterlabel"> 4</div><div class="q1">
 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C4V1">&nbsp;</a>How the gold has become dim!
</div>
<div class="q2">The most pure gold has changed!
</div>
<div class="q1">The stones of the sanctuary are poured out
</div>
<div class="q2">at the head of every street.
</div>
<div class="b"></div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C4V2">&nbsp;</a>The precious sons of Zion,
</div>
<div class="q2">comparable to fine gold,
</div>
<div class="q1">How are they esteemed as earthen pitchers,
</div>
<div class="q2">the work of the hands of the potter!
</div>
<div class="b"></div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C4V3">&nbsp;</a>Even the jackals draw out the breast,
</div>
<div class="q2">they nurse their young ones:
</div>
<div class="q1">But the daughter of my people has become cruel,
</div>
<div class="q2">like the ostriches in the wilderness.
</div>
<div class="b"></div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C4V4">&nbsp;</a>The tongue of the nursing child clings to the roof of his mouth for thirst:
</div>
<div class="q2">The young children ask bread,
</div>
<div class="q2">and no man breaks it to them.
</div>
<div class="b"></div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C4V5">&nbsp;</a>Those who fed delicately are desolate in the streets:
</div>
<div class="q2">Those who were brought up in scarlet embrace dunghills.
</div>
<div class="b"></div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C4V6">&nbsp;</a>For the iniquity of the daughter of my people is greater than the sin of Sodom,
</div>
<div class="q2">That was overthrown as in a moment,
</div>
<div class="q2">and no hands were laid on her.
</div>
<div class="b"></div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C4V7">&nbsp;</a>Her nobles were purer than snow,
</div>
<div class="q2">they were whiter than milk;
</div>
<div class="q1">They were more ruddy in body than rubies,
</div>
<div class="q2">their polishing was as of sapphire.
</div>
<div class="b"></div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C4V8">&nbsp;</a>Their appearance is blacker than a coal;
</div>
<div class="q2">they are not known in the streets:
</div>
<div class="q1">Their skin clings to their bones;
</div>
<div class="q2">it is withered,
</div>
<div class="q2">it has become like a stick.
</div>
<div class="b"></div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C4V9">&nbsp;</a>Those who are killed with the sword are better than those who are killed with hunger;
</div>
<div class="q2">For these pine away, stricken through,
</div>
<div class="q2">for want of the fruits of the field.
</div>
<div class="b"></div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C4V10">&nbsp;</a>The hands of the pitiful women have boiled their own children;
</div>
<div class="q2">They were their food in the destruction of the daughter of my people.
</div>
<div class="b"></div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C4V11">&nbsp;</a>Yahweh has accomplished his wrath,
</div>
<div class="q2">he has poured out his fierce anger;
</div>
<div class="q1">He has kindled a fire in Zion,
</div>
<div class="q2">which has devoured its foundations.
</div>
<div class="b"></div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C4V12">&nbsp;</a>The kings of the earth didn’t believe,
</div>
<div class="q2">neither did all the inhabitants of the world,
</div>
<div class="q2">That the adversary and the enemy would enter into the gates of Jerusalem.
</div>
<div class="b"></div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C4V13">&nbsp;</a>It is because of the sins of her prophets,
</div>
<div class="q2">and the iniquities of her priests,
</div>
<div class="q2">That have shed the blood of the just in the middle of her.
</div>
<div class="b"></div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C4V14">&nbsp;</a>They wander as blind men in the streets.
</div>
<div class="q2">They are polluted with blood,
</div>
<div class="q2">So that men can’t touch their garments.
</div>
<div class="b"></div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C4V15">&nbsp;</a>“Go away!” they cried to them,
</div>
<div class="q2">“Unclean! Go away! Go away! Don’t touch!
</div>
<div class="q1">When they fled away and wandered, men said among the nations,
</div>
<div class="q2">“They can’t live here any more.”
</div>
<div class="b"></div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C4V16">&nbsp;</a>Yahweh’s anger has scattered them;
</div>
<div class="q2">he will no more regard them:
</div>
<div class="q1">They didn’t respect the persons of the priests,
</div>
<div class="q2">they didn’t favor the elders.
</div>
<div class="b"></div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C4V17">&nbsp;</a>Our eyes still fail,
</div>
<div class="q2">looking in vain for our help:
</div>
<div class="q2">In our watching we have watched for a nation that could not save.
</div>
<div class="b"></div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C4V18">&nbsp;</a>They hunt our steps,
</div>
<div class="q2">so that we can’t go in our streets:
</div>
<div class="q1">Our end is near,
</div>
<div class="q2">our days are fulfilled;
</div>
<div class="q2">for our end has come.
</div>
<div class="b"></div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C4V19">&nbsp;</a>Our pursuers were swifter than the eagles of the sky:
</div>
<div class="q2">They chased us on the mountains,
</div>
<div class="q2">they laid wait for us in the wilderness.
</div>
<div class="b"></div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C4V20">&nbsp;</a>The breath of our nostrils,
</div>
<div class="q2">the anointed of Yahweh,
</div>
<div class="q2">was taken in their pits;
</div>
<div class="q1">Of whom we said,
</div>
<div class="q2">Under his shadow we will live among the nations.
</div>
<div class="b"></div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C4V21">&nbsp;</a>Rejoice and be glad, daughter of Edom,
</div>
<div class="q2">that dwell in the land of Uz:
</div>
<div class="q1">The cup will pass through to you also;
</div>
<div class="q2">you will be drunken,
</div>
<div class="q2">and will make yourself naked.
</div>
<div class="b"></div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C4V22">&nbsp;</a>The punishment of your iniquity is accomplished, daughter of Zion;
</div>
<div class="q2">he will no more carry you away into captivity:
</div>
<div class="q1">He will visit your iniquity, daughter of Edom;
</div>
<div class="q2">he will uncover your sins.
