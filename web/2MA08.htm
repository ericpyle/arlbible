</span> Maccabaeus, and they that were with him, making their way privily into the villages, called to them
their kinsfolk; and taking to them such as had continued in the Jews’ religion, gathered together as
many as six thousand.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C8V2">&nbsp;</a>And they called upon the Lord,
<span class="add">beseeching him
</span> to look upon the people that was oppressed by all; and to have compassion on the sanctuary also that
had been profaned by the ungodly men;
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C8V3">&nbsp;</a>and to have pity on the city also that was suffering ruin and ready to be made even even with the ground;
and to hearken to the blood that cried to him;

 the blasphemies that had been committed against his name; and to show his hatred of wickedness.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C8V5">&nbsp;</a>And when Maccabaeus had trained his men for service, the heathen at once found him irresistible, for
that the wrath of the Lord was turned into pity.

 And coming unawares he set fire to cities and villages. And in winning back the most important positions,
putting to flight no small number of the enemies,

with dismay at the enemy, nor to fear the great multitude of the heathen who came wrongfully against
them; but to contend nobly,

shameful handling of the city that had been turned to mockery, and further the overthrow of the mode
