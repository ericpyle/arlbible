 In the second year of the reign of Artaxerxes the great, in the first day of the month Nisan, Mardocheus
the son of Jairus, the son of Semeias, the son of Kiseus, of the tribe of Benjamin, had a dream;
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C11V3">&nbsp;</a>who was a Jew, and lived in the city of Susa, a great man, being a servitor in the king’s court;
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C11V4">&nbsp;</a>and he was of the captivity, which Nabuchodonosor the king of Babylon carried from Jerusalem with Jechonias
king of Judaea; and this was his dream:
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C11V5">&nbsp;</a>Behold,
<a href="#FN2"><span class="notemark">†</span><span class="popup">Another reading is,

 noise and tumult, thunderings and earthquake,
<span class="add">and</span> uproar upon the earth:
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C11V6">&nbsp;</a>and, behold, two great dragons came forth, both of them ready to fight, and their cry was great.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C11V7">&nbsp;</a>And at their cry all nations were ready to battle, that they might fight against the righteous nation.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C11V8">&nbsp;</a>And, behold, a day of darkness and gloominess, tribulation and anguish, affliction and great uproar upon
the earth.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C11V9">&nbsp;</a>And the whole righteous nation was troubled, fearing

</span></a>
 the evils that should befall them, and were ready to perish.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C11V10">&nbsp;</a>Then they cried to God, and upon their cry, as it were from a little fountain, there came a great river,
<span class="add">even
</span> much water.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C11V11">&nbsp;</a>The light and the sun rose up, and the lowly were exalted, and devoured the glorious.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C11V12">&nbsp;</a>Now when Mardocheus, who had seen this dream, and what God had determined to do, was awake, he bare it
in mind, and until night by all means was desirous to know it.
