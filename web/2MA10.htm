 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C10V1">&nbsp;</a>And Maccabaeus and they that were with him, the Lord leading them on, recovered the temple and the city;
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C10V2">&nbsp;</a>and they pulled down the altars that had been built in the marketplace by the aliens, and also
<span class="add">the walls of
</span> sacred inclosures.

 striking stones and taking fire out of them, they offered sacrifices, after
<span class="add">they had ceased for
</span> two years, and
<span class="add">burned
</span> incense, and
<span class="add">lighted
</span> lamps, and set forth the show bread.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C10V4">&nbsp;</a>And when they had done these things, they fell prostrate and implored the Lord that they might fall no
more into such evils; but that, if ever they should sin, they might be chastened by him with forbearance,
and not be delivered to blaspheming and barbarous heathen.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C10V5">&nbsp;</a>Now on the same day that the sanctuary was profaned by aliens, upon that very day did it come to pass
that the cleansing of the sanctuary was made, even on the five and twentieth day of the same month, which
is Chislev.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C10V6">&nbsp;</a>And they kept eight days with gladness in the manner
<span class="add">of the feast

 not long before, during the feast of tabernacles, they were wandering in the mountains and in the caves
after the manner of wild beasts.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C10V7">&nbsp;</a>Wherefore bearing wands wreathed with leaves, and fair boughs, and palms also, they offered up hymns
of thanksgiving to him that had prosperously brought to pass the cleansing of his own place.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C10V8">&nbsp;</a>They ordained also with a common statute and decree, for all the nation of the Jews, that they should
keep these days every year.

such were the
events
of the end

 such was the end of Antiochus, who was called Epiphanes.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C10V10">&nbsp;</a>But now will we declare what came to pass under Antiochus

 Eupator, who proved himself a

 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C10V11">&nbsp;</a>For this man, when he succeeded to the kingdom, appointed one Lysias
<span class="add">to be
</span> chancellor, and supreme governor of Coelesyria and Phoenicia.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C10V12">&nbsp;</a>For Ptolemy that was called Macron, setting an example of observing justice toward the Jews because of
the wrong that had been done to them, endeavoured to

which Philometor had intrusted to him, and had withdrawn himself to Antiochus

</span> Epiphanes, and
<a href="#FN8"><span class="notemark">§§</span><span class="popup">The Greek text here is corrupt.
</span></a>
 failing to uphold the honor of his office, he took poison and made away with himself.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C10V14">&nbsp;</a>But Gorgias, when he was made governor of the district, maintained a force of mercenaries, and at every
turn kept up war with the Jews.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C10V15">&nbsp;</a>And together with him the Idumaeans also, being masters of important strongholds, harassed the Jews;
and receiving to them those that had taken refuge
<span class="add">there
</span> from Jerusalem, they assayed to keep up war.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C10V16">&nbsp;</a>But Maccabaeus and his men, having made solemn supplication and implored God to fight on their side,
rushed upon the strongholds of the Idumaeans;
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C10V17">&nbsp;</a>and assaulting them vigorously they made themselves masters of the positions, and kept off all that fought
upon the wall, and killed those that fell in their way, and killed no fewer than twenty thousand.
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C10V18">&nbsp;</a>And because no less than nine thousand were fled into two towers exceeding strong and having all things
<span class="add">needed
</span> for a seige,
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C10V19">&nbsp;</a>Maccabaeus, having left Simon and Joseph, and Zacchaeus besides and them that were with him, a force
sufficient to besiege them, departed himself to places where he was most needed.
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C10V20">&nbsp;</a>But Simon and they that were with him, yielding to covetousness, were bribed by certain of those that
were in the towers, and receiving seventy thousand drachmas let some of them slip away.
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C10V21">&nbsp;</a>But when word was brought to Maccabaeus of what was done, he gathered the leaders of the people together,
and accused
<span class="add">those men
</span> of having sold their brethren for money, by setting their enemies free
<span class="add">to fight
</span> against them.
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C10V22">&nbsp;</a>So he killed these men for having turned traitors, and forthwith took possession of the two towers.
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C10V23">&nbsp;</a>And prospering with his arms in all things he took in hand, he destroyed in the two strongholds more
than twenty thousand.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C10V24">&nbsp;</a>Now Timotheus, who had been before defeated by the Jews, having gathered together foreign forces in great
multitudes, and having collected the
<a href="#FN9"><span class="notemark">***</span><span class="popup">Or,
horses
</span></a>
 horsemen which belonged to Asia, not a few, came as though he would take Judaea by force of arms.
 <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C10V25">&nbsp;</a>But as he drew near, Maccabaeus and his men sprinkled earth upon their heads and girded their loins with
sackcloth, in supplication to God,
 <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C10V26">&nbsp;</a>and falling down upon the step in front of the altar, implored him to become
<a href="#FN10"><span class="notemark">†††</span><span class="popup">Gr.

</span></a>
 gracious to them, and
<a href="#FN11"><span class="notemark">‡‡‡</span><span class="popup">See Exodus 23:22.
</span></a>
 be an enemy to their enemies and an adversary to their adversaries, as the law declares.
 <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C10V27">&nbsp;</a>And rising from their prayer they took up their arms, and advanced some distance from the city; and when
they had come near to their enemies they
<a href="#FN12"><span class="notemark">§§§</span><span class="popup">Gr.
were by themselves.</span></a>
 halted.
 <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C10V28">&nbsp;</a>And when the dawn was now spreading, the two
<span class="add">armies
</span> joined battle; the one part having this, beside
<span class="add">their
</span> virtue, for a pledge of success and victory, that they had fled to the Lord for refuge, the others making
their passion their leader in the strife.
 <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C10V29">&nbsp;</a>But when the battle waxed strong, there appeared out of heaven to their adversaries five men on horses
with bridles of gold,
<span class="add">in
</span> splendid
<span class="add">array;
</span><a href="#FN13"><span class="notemark">*</span><span class="popup">Some authorities read

</span></a>
 and two of them, leading on the Jews,
 <span class="verse"> 30</span><a name="C10V30">&nbsp;</a>and taking Maccabaeus in the midst of them, and covering him with their own armor, guarded him from wounds,
while on the adversaries they shot forth arrows and thunderbolts; by reason whereof they were blinded
and thrown into confusion, and were cut to pieces, filled with bewilderment.
 <span class="verse"> 31</span><a name="C10V31">&nbsp;</a>And there were slain twenty thousand and five hundred, beside six hundred horsemen.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 32</span><a name="C10V32">&nbsp;</a>But Timotheus himself fled into a stronghold called Gazara, a fortress of exceeding strength,
<a href="#FN14"><span class="notemark">†</span><span class="popup">See ver 37.
</span></a>
 Chaereas being in command there.
 <span class="verse"> 33</span><a name="C10V33">&nbsp;</a>But Maccabaeus and his men were glad and laid siege to the fortress four and twenty days.
 <span class="verse"> 34</span><a name="C10V34">&nbsp;</a>And they that were within, trusting to the strength of the place, blasphemed exceedingly, and hurled
forth impious words.
 <span class="verse"> 35</span><a name="C10V35">&nbsp;</a>But at dawn of the five and twentieth day certain young men of the company of Maccabaeus, inflamed with
passion because of the blasphemies, assaulted the wall with masculine force and with
<a href="#FN15"><span class="notemark">‡</span><span class="popup">Gr.
passion as of wild beasts.
</span></a>
 furious passion, and cut down whoever came in their way.
 <span class="verse"> 36</span><a name="C10V36">&nbsp;</a>And others climbing up in like manner, while
<span class="add">the besieged
</span> were distracted with them
<span class="add">that had made their way
</span> within, set fire to the towers, and kindling fires burned the blasphemers alive; while others broke
open the gates, and, having given entrance to the rest of the band, occupied the city.
 <span class="verse"> 37</span><a name="C10V37">&nbsp;</a>And they killed Timotheus, who was hidden in a cistern, and his brother Chaereas, and Apollophanes.
 <span class="verse"> 38</span><a name="C10V38">&nbsp;</a>And when they had accomplished these things, they blessed the Lord with hymns and thanksgivings, him
who does great benefits to Israel, and gives them the victory.
