 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C23V1">&nbsp;</a>The whole company of them rose up and brought him before Pilate.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C23V2">&nbsp;</a>They began to accuse him, saying, “We found this man perverting the nation, forbidding paying taxes to
Caesar, and saying that he himself is Christ, a king.”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C23V3">&nbsp;</a>Pilate asked him, “Are you the King of the Jews?”
</div>
<div class="p">He answered him,
<span class="wj">“So you say.”</span></div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C23V4">&nbsp;</a>Pilate said to the chief priests and the multitudes, “I find no basis for a charge against this man.”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C23V5">&nbsp;</a>But they insisted, saying, “He stirs up the people, teaching throughout all Judea, beginning from Galilee
even to this place.”
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C23V6">&nbsp;</a>But when Pilate heard Galilee mentioned, he asked if the man was a Galilean.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C23V7">&nbsp;</a>When he found out that he was in Herod’s jurisdiction, he sent him to Herod, who was also in Jerusalem
during those days.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C23V8">&nbsp;</a>Now when Herod saw Jesus, he was exceedingly glad, for he had wanted to see him for a long time, because
he had heard many things about him. He hoped to see some miracle done by him.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C23V9">&nbsp;</a>He questioned him with many words, but he gave no answers.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C23V10">&nbsp;</a>The chief priests and the scribes stood, vehemently accusing him.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C23V11">&nbsp;</a>Herod with his soldiers humiliated him and mocked him. Dressing him in luxurious clothing, they sent
him back to Pilate.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C23V12">&nbsp;</a>Herod and Pilate became friends with each other that very day, for before that they were enemies with
each other.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C23V13">&nbsp;</a>Pilate called together the chief priests and the rulers and the people,
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C23V14">&nbsp;</a>and said to them, “You brought this man to me as one that perverts the people, and see, I have examined
him before you, and found no basis for a charge against this man concerning those things of which you
accuse him.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C23V15">&nbsp;</a>Neither has Herod, for I sent you to him, and see, nothing worthy of death has been done by him.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C23V16">&nbsp;</a>I will therefore chastise him and release him.”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C23V17">&nbsp;</a>Now he had to release one prisoner to them at the feast.<a href="#FN1"><span class="notemark">*</span><span class="popup">NU omits verse 17.</span></a>
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C23V18">&nbsp;</a>But they all cried out together, saying, “Away with this man! Release to us Barabbas!”—
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C23V19">&nbsp;</a>one who was thrown into prison for a certain revolt in the city, and for murder.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C23V20">&nbsp;</a>Then Pilate spoke to them again, wanting to release Jesus,
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C23V21">&nbsp;</a>but they shouted, saying, “Crucify! Crucify him!”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C23V22">&nbsp;</a>He said to them the third time, “Why? What evil has this man done? I have found no capital crime in him.
I will therefore chastise him and release him.”
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C23V23">&nbsp;</a>But they were urgent with loud voices, asking that he might be crucified. Their voices and the voices
of the chief priests prevailed.
 <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C23V24">&nbsp;</a>Pilate decreed that what they asked for should be done.
 <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C23V25">&nbsp;</a>He released him who had been thrown into prison for insurrection and murder, for whom they asked, but
he delivered Jesus up to their will.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C23V26">&nbsp;</a>When they led him away, they grabbed one Simon of Cyrene, coming from the country, and laid on him the
cross, to carry it after Jesus.
 <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C23V27">&nbsp;</a>A great multitude of the people followed him, including women who also mourned and lamented him.
 <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C23V28">&nbsp;</a>But Jesus, turning to them, said,
<span class="wj">“Daughters of Jerusalem, don’t weep for me, but weep for yourselves and for your children.
</span> <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C23V29">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">For behold, the days are coming in which they will say, ‘Blessed are the barren, the wombs that never
bore, and the breasts that never nursed.’
</span> <span class="verse"> 30</span><a name="C23V30">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Then they will begin to tell the mountains, ‘Fall on us!’ and tell the hills, ‘Cover us.’</span><a href="#FN2"><span class="notemark"></span><span class="popup">+ Hosea 10:8</span></a>
 <span class="verse"> 31</span><a name="C23V31">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">For if they do these things in the green tree, what will be done in the dry?”</span></div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 32</span><a name="C23V32">&nbsp;</a>There were also others, two criminals, led with him to be put to death.
 <span class="verse"> 33</span><a name="C23V33">&nbsp;</a>When they came to the place that is called The Skull, they crucified him there with the criminals, one
on the right and the other on the left.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 34</span><a name="C23V34">&nbsp;</a>Jesus said,
<span class="wj">“Father, forgive them, for they don’t know what they are doing.”</span></div>
<div class="p">Dividing his garments among them, they cast lots.
 <span class="verse"> 35</span><a name="C23V35">&nbsp;</a>The people stood watching. The rulers with them also scoffed at him, saying, “He saved others. Let him
save himself, if this is the Christ of God, his chosen one!”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 36</span><a name="C23V36">&nbsp;</a>The soldiers also mocked him, coming to him and offering him vinegar,
 <span class="verse"> 37</span><a name="C23V37">&nbsp;</a>and saying, “If you are the King of the Jews, save yourself!”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 38</span><a name="C23V38">&nbsp;</a>An inscription was also written over him in letters of Greek, Latin, and Hebrew: “THIS IS THE KING OF
THE JEWS.”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 39</span><a name="C23V39">&nbsp;</a>One of the criminals who was hanged insulted him, saying, “If you are the Christ, save yourself and us!”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 40</span><a name="C23V40">&nbsp;</a>But the other answered, and rebuking him said, “Don’t you even fear God, seeing you are under the same
condemnation?
 <span class="verse"> 41</span><a name="C23V41">&nbsp;</a>And we indeed justly, for we receive the due reward for our deeds, but this man has done nothing wrong.”
 <span class="verse"> 42</span><a name="C23V42">&nbsp;</a>He said to Jesus, “Lord, remember me when you come into your Kingdom.”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 43</span><a name="C23V43">&nbsp;</a>Jesus said to him,
<span class="wj">“Assuredly I tell you, today you will be with me in Paradise.”</span></div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 44</span><a name="C23V44">&nbsp;</a>It was now about the sixth hour,<a href="#FN3"><span class="notemark">†</span><span class="popup">Time was counted from sunrise, so the sixth hour was about noon.</span></a>
 and darkness came over the whole land until the ninth hour.<a href="#FN4"><span class="notemark">‡</span><span class="popup">3:00 p.m.</span></a>
 <span class="verse"> 45</span><a name="C23V45">&nbsp;</a>The sun was darkened, and the veil of the temple was torn in two.
 <span class="verse"> 46</span><a name="C23V46">&nbsp;</a>Jesus, crying with a loud voice, said,
<span class="wj">“Father, into your hands I commit my spirit!”</span> Having said this, he breathed his last.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 47</span><a name="C23V47">&nbsp;</a>When the centurion saw what was done, he glorified God, saying, “Certainly this was a righteous man.”
 <span class="verse"> 48</span><a name="C23V48">&nbsp;</a>All the multitudes that came together to see this, when they saw the things that were done, returned
home beating their breasts.
 <span class="verse"> 49</span><a name="C23V49">&nbsp;</a>All his acquaintances, and the women who followed with him from Galilee, stood at a distance, watching
these things.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 50</span><a name="C23V50">&nbsp;</a>Behold, a man named Joseph, who was a member of the council, a good and righteous man
 <span class="verse"> 51</span><a name="C23V51">&nbsp;</a>(he had not consented to their counsel and deed), from Arimathaea, a city of the Jews, who was also waiting
for God’s Kingdom:
 <span class="verse"> 52</span><a name="C23V52">&nbsp;</a>this man went to Pilate, and asked for Jesus’ body.
 <span class="verse"> 53</span><a name="C23V53">&nbsp;</a>He took it down, and wrapped it in a linen cloth, and laid him in a tomb that was cut in stone, where
no one had ever been laid.
 <span class="verse"> 54</span><a name="C23V54">&nbsp;</a>It was the day of the Preparation, and the Sabbath was drawing near.
 <span class="verse"> 55</span><a name="C23V55">&nbsp;</a>The women, who had come with him out of Galilee, followed after, and saw the tomb, and how his body was
laid.
 <span class="verse"> 56</span><a name="C23V56">&nbsp;</a>They returned, and prepared spices and ointments. On the Sabbath they rested according to the commandment.
