 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C1V1">&nbsp;</a>The elder, to the chosen lady and her children, whom I love in truth; and not I only, but also all those
who know the truth;
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C1V2">&nbsp;</a>for the truth’s sake, which remains in us, and it will be with us forever:
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C1V3">&nbsp;</a>Grace, mercy, and peace will be with us, from God the Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son
of the Father, in truth and love.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C1V4">&nbsp;</a>I rejoice greatly that I have found some of your children walking in truth, even as we have been commanded
by the Father.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C1V5">&nbsp;</a>Now I beg you, dear lady, not as though I wrote to you a new commandment, but that which we had from
the beginning, that we love one another.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C1V6">&nbsp;</a>This is love, that we should walk according to his commandments. This is the commandment, even as you
heard from the beginning, that you should walk in it.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C1V7">&nbsp;</a>For many deceivers have gone out into the world, those who don’t confess that Jesus Christ came in the
flesh. This is the deceiver and the Antichrist.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C1V8">&nbsp;</a>Watch yourselves, that we don’t lose the things which we have accomplished, but that we receive a full
reward.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C1V9">&nbsp;</a>Whoever transgresses and doesn’t remain in the teaching of Christ, doesn’t have God. He who remains in
the teaching, the same has both the Father and the Son.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C1V10">&nbsp;</a>If anyone comes to you, and doesn’t bring this teaching, don’t receive him into your house, and don’t
welcome him,
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C1V11">&nbsp;</a>for he who welcomes him participates in his evil deeds.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C1V12">&nbsp;</a>Having many things to write to you, I don’t want to do so with paper and ink, but I hope to come to you,
and to speak face to face, that our joy may be made full.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C1V13">&nbsp;</a>The children of your chosen sister greet you. Amen.
