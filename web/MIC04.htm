<div class="chapterlabel"> 4</div><div class="q1">
 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C4V1">&nbsp;</a>But in the latter days,
</div>
<div class="q2">it will happen that the mountain of Yahweh’s temple will be established on the top of the mountains,
</div>
<div class="q2">and it will be exalted above the hills;
</div>
<div class="q2">and peoples will stream to it.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C4V2">&nbsp;</a>Many nations will go and say,
</div>
<div class="q2">“Come, and let us go up to the mountain of Yahweh,
</div>
<div class="q2">and to the house of the God of Jacob;
</div>
<div class="q2">and he will teach us of his ways,
</div>
<div class="q2">and we will walk in his paths.”
</div>
<div class="q1">For the law will go out of Zion,
</div>
<div class="q2">and Yahweh’s word from Jerusalem;
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C4V3">&nbsp;</a>and he will judge between many peoples,
</div>
<div class="q2">and will decide concerning strong nations afar off.
</div>
<div class="q2">They will beat their swords into plowshares,
</div>
<div class="q2">and their spears into pruning hooks.
</div>
<div class="q1">Nation will not lift up sword against nation,
</div>
<div class="q2">neither will they learn war any more.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C4V4">&nbsp;</a>But they will sit every man under his vine and under his fig tree;
</div>
<div class="q2">and no one will make them afraid:
</div>
<div class="q2">For the mouth of Yahweh of Armies has spoken.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C4V5">&nbsp;</a>Indeed all the nations may walk in the name of their gods;
</div>
<div class="q2">but we will walk in the name of Yahweh our God forever and ever.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C4V6">&nbsp;</a>“In that day,” says Yahweh,
</div>
<div class="q2">“I will assemble that which is lame,
</div>
<div class="q2">and I will gather that which is driven away,
</div>
<div class="q2">and that which I have afflicted;
</div>
<div class="q2"> <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C4V7">&nbsp;</a>and I will make that which was lame a remnant,
</div>
<div class="q2">and that which was cast far off a strong nation:
</div>
<div class="q2">and Yahweh will reign over them on Mount Zion from then on, even forever.”
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C4V8">&nbsp;</a>You, tower of the flock, the hill of the daughter of Zion,
</div>
<div class="q2">to you it will come,
</div>
<div class="q2">yes, the former dominion will come,
</div>
<div class="q2">the kingdom of the daughter of Jerusalem.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C4V9">&nbsp;</a>Now why do you cry out aloud?
</div>
<div class="q2">Is there no king in you?
</div>
<div class="q2">Has your counselor perished,
</div>
<div class="q2">that pains have taken hold of you as of a woman in travail?
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C4V10">&nbsp;</a>Be in pain, and labor to give birth, daughter of Zion,
</div>
<div class="q2">like a woman in travail;
</div>
<div class="q2">for now you will go out of the city,
</div>
<div class="q2">and will dwell in the field,
</div>
<div class="q2">and will come even to Babylon.
</div>
<div class="q1">There you will be rescued.
</div>
<div class="q2">There Yahweh will redeem you from the hand of your enemies.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C4V11">&nbsp;</a>Now many nations have assembled against you, that say,
</div>
<div class="q2">“Let her be defiled,
</div>
<div class="q2">and let our eye gloat over Zion.”
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C4V12">&nbsp;</a>But they don’t know the thoughts of Yahweh,
</div>
<div class="q2">neither do they understand his counsel;
</div>
<div class="q2">for he has gathered them like the sheaves to the threshing floor.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C4V13">&nbsp;</a>Arise and thresh, daughter of Zion;
</div>
<div class="q2">for I will make your horn iron,
</div>
<div class="q2">and I will make your hoofs brass;
</div>
<div class="q1">and you will beat in pieces many peoples:
</div>
<div class="q1">and I will devote their gain to Yahweh,
</div>
<div class="q2">and their substance to the Lord of the whole earth.
