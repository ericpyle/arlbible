 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C11V1">&nbsp;</a>When Jabin king of Hazor heard of it, he sent to Jobab king of Madon, to the king of Shimron, to the
king of Achshaph,
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C11V2">&nbsp;</a>and to the kings who were on the north, in the hill country, in the Arabah south of Chinneroth, in the
lowland, and in the heights of Dor on the west,
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C11V3">&nbsp;</a>to the Canaanite on the east and on the west, the Amorite, the Hittite, the Perizzite, the Jebusite in
the hill country, and the Hivite under Hermon in the land of Mizpah.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C11V4">&nbsp;</a>They went out, they and all their armies with them, many people, even as the sand that is on the seashore
in multitude, with very many horses and chariots.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C11V5">&nbsp;</a>All these kings met together; and they came and encamped together at the waters of Merom, to fight with
Israel.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C11V6">&nbsp;</a>Yahweh said to Joshua, “Don’t be afraid because of them; for tomorrow at this time, I will deliver them
up all slain before Israel. You shall hamstring their horses and burn their chariots with fire.”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C11V7">&nbsp;</a>So Joshua came suddenly, with all the warriors, against them by the waters of Merom, and attacked them.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C11V8">&nbsp;</a>Yahweh delivered them into the hand of Israel, and they struck them, and chased them to great Sidon,
and to Misrephoth Maim, and to the valley of Mizpah eastward. They struck them until they left them no
one remaining.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C11V9">&nbsp;</a>Joshua did to them as Yahweh told him. He hamstrung their horses and burned their chariots with fire.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C11V10">&nbsp;</a>Joshua turned back at that time, and took Hazor, and struck its king with the sword: for Hazor used to
be the head of all those kingdoms.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C11V11">&nbsp;</a>They struck all the souls who were in it with the edge of the sword, utterly destroying them. There was
no one left who breathed. He burned Hazor with fire.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C11V12">&nbsp;</a>Joshua captured all the cities of those kings, with their kings, and he struck them with the edge of
the sword, and utterly destroyed them; as Moses the servant of Yahweh commanded.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C11V13">&nbsp;</a>But as for the cities that stood on their mounds, Israel burned none of them, except Hazor only. Joshua
burned that.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C11V14">&nbsp;</a>The children of Israel took all the plunder of these cities, with the livestock, as plunder for themselves;
but every man they struck with the edge of the sword, until they had destroyed them. They didn’t leave
any who breathed.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C11V15">&nbsp;</a>As Yahweh commanded Moses his servant, so Moses commanded Joshua. Joshua did so. He left nothing undone
of all that Yahweh commanded Moses.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C11V16">&nbsp;</a>So Joshua captured all that land, the hill country, all the South, all the land of Goshen, the lowland,
the Arabah, the hill country of Israel, and the lowland of the same;
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C11V17">&nbsp;</a>from Mount Halak, that goes up to Seir, even to Baal Gad in the valley of Lebanon under Mount Hermon.
He took all their kings, struck them, and put them to death.
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C11V18">&nbsp;</a>Joshua made war a long time with all those kings.
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C11V19">&nbsp;</a>There was not a city that made peace with the children of Israel, except the Hivites, the inhabitants
of Gibeon. They took all in battle.
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C11V20">&nbsp;</a>For it was of Yahweh to harden their hearts, to come against Israel in battle, that he might utterly
destroy them, that they might have no favor, but that he might destroy them, as Yahweh commanded Moses.
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C11V21">&nbsp;</a>Joshua came at that time, and cut off the Anakim from the hill country, from Hebron, from Debir, from
Anab, and from all the hill country of Judah, and from all the hill country of Israel: Joshua utterly
destroyed them with their cities.
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C11V22">&nbsp;</a>There were none of the Anakim left in the land of the children of Israel. Only in Gaza, in Gath, and
in Ashdod, did some remain.
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C11V23">&nbsp;</a>So Joshua took the whole land, according to all that Yahweh spoke to Moses; and Joshua gave it for an
inheritance to Israel according to their divisions by their tribes. The land had rest from war.
