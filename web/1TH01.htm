 loved by God, that you are chosen,
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C1V5">&nbsp;</a>and that our Good News came to you not in word only, but also in power, and in the Holy Spirit, and with
much assurance. You know what kind of men we showed ourselves to be among you for your sake.

the Holy Spirit,

place your faith toward God has gone out; so that we need not to say anything.

to come.
