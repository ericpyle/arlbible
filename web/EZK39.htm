 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C39V1">&nbsp;</a>“You, son of man, prophesy against Gog, and say, ‘Thus says the Lord Yahweh: “Behold, I am against you,
Gog, prince of Rosh, Meshech, and Tubal.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C39V2">&nbsp;</a>I will turn you around, and will lead you on, and will cause you to come up from the uttermost parts
of the north; and I will bring you on the mountains of Israel.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C39V3">&nbsp;</a>I will strike your bow out of your left hand, and will cause your arrows to fall out of your right hand.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C39V4">&nbsp;</a>You will fall on the mountains of Israel, you, and all your hordes, and the peoples who are with you:
I will give you to the ravenous birds of every sort, and to the animals of the field to be devoured.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C39V5">&nbsp;</a>You will fall on the open field; for I have spoken it,” says the Lord Yahweh.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C39V6">&nbsp;</a>“I will send a fire on Magog, and on those who dwell securely in the islands. Then they will know that
I am Yahweh.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C39V7">&nbsp;</a>“‘“I will make my holy name known among my people Israel; neither will I allow my holy name to be profaned
any more. Then the nations will know that I am Yahweh, the Holy One in Israel.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C39V8">&nbsp;</a>Behold, it comes, and it will be done,” says the Lord Yahweh. “This is the day about which I have spoken.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C39V9">&nbsp;</a>“‘“Those who dwell in the cities of Israel will go out, and will make fires of the weapons and burn them,
both the shields and the bucklers, the bows and the arrows, and the war clubs, and the spears, and they
will make fires of them seven years;
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C39V10">&nbsp;</a>so that they will take no wood out of the field, neither cut down any out of the forests; for they will
make fires of the weapons; and they will plunder those who plundered them, and rob those who robbed them,”
says the Lord Yahweh.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C39V11">&nbsp;</a>“‘“It will happen in that day, that I will give to Gog a place for burial in Israel, the valley of those
who pass through on the east of the sea; and it will stop those who pass through: and there they will
bury Gog and all his multitude; and they will call it ‘The valley of Hamon Gog’.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C39V12">&nbsp;</a>“‘“The house of Israel will be burying them for seven months, that they may cleanse the land.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C39V13">&nbsp;</a>Yes, all the people of the land will bury them; and it will be to them a renown in the day that I will
be glorified,” says the Lord Yahweh.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C39V14">&nbsp;</a>“‘“They will set apart men of continual employment, who will pass through the land, and, with those who
pass through, those who bury those who remain on the surface of the land, to cleanse it. After the end
of seven months they will search.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C39V15">&nbsp;</a>Those who pass through the land will pass through; and when any sees a man’s bone, then will he set up
a sign by it, until the undertakers have buried it in the valley of Hamon Gog.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C39V16">&nbsp;</a>Hamonah will also be the name of a city. Thus will they cleanse the land.”’
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C39V17">&nbsp;</a>“You, son of man, thus says the Lord Yahweh: ‘Speak to the birds of every sort, and to every animal of
the field, “Assemble yourselves, and come; gather yourselves on every side to my sacrifice that I do
sacrifice for you, even a great sacrifice on the mountains of Israel, that you may eat meat and drink
blood.
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C39V18">&nbsp;</a>You shall eat the flesh of the mighty, and drink the blood of the princes of the earth, of rams, of lambs,
and of goats, of bulls, all of them fatlings of Bashan.
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C39V19">&nbsp;</a>You shall eat fat until you be full, and drink blood until you are drunk, of my sacrifice which I have
sacrificed for you.
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C39V20">&nbsp;</a>You shall be filled at my table with horses and chariots, with mighty men, and with all men of war,”
says the Lord Yahweh.’

<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C39V21">&nbsp;</a>“I will set my glory among the nations; and all the nations will see my judgment that I have executed,
and my hand that I have laid on them.
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C39V22">&nbsp;</a>So the house of Israel will know that I am Yahweh their God, from that day and forward.
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C39V23">&nbsp;</a>The nations will know that the house of Israel went into captivity for their iniquity; because they trespassed
against me, and I hid my face from them: so I gave them into the hand of their adversaries, and they
fell all of them by the sword.
 <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C39V24">&nbsp;</a>According to their uncleanness and according to their transgressions did I to them; and I hid my face
from them.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C39V25">&nbsp;</a>“Therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh: ‘Now I will bring back the captivity of Jacob, and have mercy on
the whole house of Israel. I will be jealous for my holy name.
 <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C39V26">&nbsp;</a>They will bear their shame, and all their trespasses by which they have trespassed against me, when they
dwell securely in their land, and no one will make them afraid,
 <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C39V27">&nbsp;</a>when I have brought them back from the peoples, and gathered them out of their enemies’ lands, and am
sanctified in them in the sight of many nations.
 <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C39V28">&nbsp;</a>They will know that I am Yahweh their God, in that I caused them to go into captivity among the nations,
and have gathered them to their own land; and I will leave none of them any more there;
 <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C39V29">&nbsp;</a>neither will I hide my face any more from them; for I have poured out my Spirit on the house of Israel,’
says the Lord Yahweh.”
