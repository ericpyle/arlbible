 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C2V1">&nbsp;</a>You therefore, my child, be strengthened in the grace that is in Christ Jesus.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C2V2">&nbsp;</a>The things which you have heard from me among many witnesses, commit the same to faithful men, who will
be able to teach others also.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C2V3">&nbsp;</a>You therefore must endure hardship, as a good soldier of Christ Jesus.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C2V4">&nbsp;</a>No soldier on duty entangles himself in the affairs of life, that he may please him who enrolled him
as a soldier.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C2V5">&nbsp;</a>Also, if anyone competes in athletics, he isn’t crowned unless he has competed by the rules.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C2V6">&nbsp;</a>The farmer who labors must be the first to get a share of the crops.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C2V7">&nbsp;</a>Consider what I say, and may the Lord give you understanding in all things.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C2V8">&nbsp;</a>Remember Jesus Christ, risen from the dead, of the offspring<a href="#FN1"><span class="notemark">*</span><span class="popup">or, seed</span></a>
 of David, according to my Good News,
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C2V9">&nbsp;</a>in which I suffer hardship to the point of chains as a criminal. But God’s word isn’t chained.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C2V10">&nbsp;</a>Therefore I endure all things for the chosen ones’ sake, that they also may obtain the salvation which
is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C2V11">&nbsp;</a>This saying is trustworthy:
</div>
<div class="q1">“For if we died with him,
</div>
<div class="q2">we will also live with him.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C2V12">&nbsp;</a>If we endure,
</div>
<div class="q2">we will also reign with him.
</div>
<div class="q1">If we deny him,
</div>
<div class="q2">he also will deny us.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C2V13">&nbsp;</a>If we are faithless,
</div>
<div class="q2">he remains faithful.
</div>
<div class="q2">For he can’t deny himself.”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C2V14">&nbsp;</a>Remind them of these things, charging them in the sight of the Lord, that they don’t argue about words,
to no profit, to the subverting of those who hear.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C2V15">&nbsp;</a>Give diligence to present yourself approved by God, a workman who doesn’t need to be ashamed, properly
handling the Word of Truth.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C2V16">&nbsp;</a>But shun empty chatter, for it will go further in ungodliness,
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C2V17">&nbsp;</a>and those words will consume like gangrene, of whom is Hymenaeus and Philetus;
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C2V18">&nbsp;</a>men who have erred concerning the truth, saying that the resurrection is already past, and overthrowing
the faith of some.
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C2V19">&nbsp;</a>However God’s firm foundation stands, having this seal, “The Lord knows those who are his,”<a href="#FN2"><span class="notemark"></span><span class="popup">+ Numbers 16:5</span></a>
 and, “Let every one who names the name of the Lord<a href="#FN3"><span class="notemark">†</span><span class="popup">TR reads “Christ” instead of “the Lord”</span></a>
 depart from unrighteousness.”
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C2V20">&nbsp;</a>Now in a large house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver, but also of wood and of clay.
Some are for honor, and some for dishonor.
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C2V21">&nbsp;</a>If anyone therefore purges himself from these, he will be a vessel for honor, sanctified, and suitable
for the master’s use, prepared for every good work.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C2V22">&nbsp;</a>Flee from youthful lusts; but pursue righteousness, faith, love, and peace with those who call on the
Lord out of a pure heart.
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C2V23">&nbsp;</a>But refuse foolish and ignorant questionings, knowing that they generate strife.
 <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C2V24">&nbsp;</a>The Lord’s servant must not quarrel, but be gentle towards all, able to teach, patient,
 <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C2V25">&nbsp;</a>in gentleness correcting those who oppose him: perhaps God may give them repentance leading to a full
knowledge of the truth,
 <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C2V26">&nbsp;</a>and they may recover themselves out of the devil’s snare, having been taken captive by him to his will.
