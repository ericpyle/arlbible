 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C12V1">&nbsp;</a>Meanwhile, when a multitude of many thousands had gathered together, so much so that they trampled on
each other, he began to tell his disciples first of all,
<span class="wj">“Beware of the yeast of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy.
</span> <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C12V2">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">But there is nothing covered up, that will not be revealed, nor hidden, that will not be known.
</span> <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C12V3">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Therefore whatever you have said in the darkness will be heard in the light. What you have spoken in
the ear in the inner rooms will be proclaimed on the housetops.</span></div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C12V4">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">“I tell you, my friends, don’t be afraid of those who kill the body, and after that have no more that
they can do.
</span> <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C12V5">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">But I will warn you whom you should fear. Fear him, who after he has killed, has power to cast into Gehenna.</span><a href="#FN1"><span class="notemark">*</span><span class="popup">or, Hell</span></a>
<span class="wj">Yes, I tell you, fear him.</span></div>

<span class="wj">? Not one of them is forgotten by God.
</span> <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C12V7">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">But the very hairs of your head are all counted. Therefore don’t be afraid. You are of more value than
many sparrows.</span></div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C12V8">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">“I tell you, everyone who confesses me before men, him will the Son of Man also confess before the angels
of God;
</span> <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C12V9">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">but he who denies me in the presence of men will be denied in the presence of the angels of God.

Holy Spirit will not be forgiven.

<span class="wj">“Man, who made me a judge or an arbitrator over you?”</span> <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C12V15">&nbsp;</a>He said to them,
<span class="wj">“Beware! Keep yourselves from covetousness, for a man’s life doesn’t consist of the abundance of the
things which he possesses.”</span></div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C12V16">&nbsp;</a>He spoke a parable to them, saying,
<span class="wj">“The ground of a certain rich man produced abundantly.

</span> <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C12V18">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">He said, ‘This is what I will do. I will pull down my barns, and build bigger ones, and there I will
store all my grain and my goods.

merry.”’</span></div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C12V20">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">“But God said to him, ‘You foolish one, tonight your soul is required of you. The things which you have
prepared—whose will they be?’

<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C12V22">&nbsp;</a>He said to his disciples,
<span class="wj">“Therefore I tell you, don’t be anxious for your life, what you will eat, nor yet for your body, what
you will wear.
</span> <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C12V23">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Life is more than food, and the body is more than clothing.
</span> <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C12V24">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Consider the ravens: they don’t sow, they don’t reap, they have no warehouse or barn, and God feeds them.
How much more valuable are you than birds!

or 46 centimeters.</span></a>
 to his height?
</span> <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C12V26">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">If then you aren’t able to do even the least things, why are you anxious about the rest?
</span> <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C12V27">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Consider the lilies, how they grow. They don’t toil, neither do they spin; yet I tell you, even Solomon
in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.
</span> <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C12V28">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">But if this is how God clothes the grass in the field, which today exists, and tomorrow is cast into
the oven, how much more will he clothe you, O you of little faith?
</span> <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C12V29">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Don’t seek what you will eat or what you will drink; neither be anxious.
</span> <span class="verse"> 30</span><a name="C12V30">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">For the nations of the world seek after all of these things, but your Father knows that you need these
things.
</span> <span class="verse"> 31</span><a name="C12V31">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">But seek God’s Kingdom, and all these things will be added to you.
</span> <span class="verse"> 32</span><a name="C12V32">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Don’t be afraid, little flock, for it is your Father’s good pleasure to give you the Kingdom.
</span> <span class="verse"> 33</span><a name="C12V33">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Sell that which you have, and give gifts to the needy. Make for yourselves purses which don’t grow old,
a treasure in the heavens that doesn’t fail, where no thief approaches, neither moth destroys.
</span> <span class="verse"> 34</span><a name="C12V34">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.

</span> <span class="verse"> 36</span><a name="C12V36">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Be like men watching for their lord, when he returns from the marriage feast; that, when he comes and
knocks, they may immediately open to him.
</span> <span class="verse"> 37</span><a name="C12V37">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Blessed are those servants, whom the lord will find watching when he comes. Most certainly I tell you,
that he will dress himself, and make them recline, and will come and serve them.
</span> <span class="verse"> 38</span><a name="C12V38">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">They will be blessed if he comes in the second or third watch, and finds them so.
</span> <span class="verse"> 39</span><a name="C12V39">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">But know this, that if the master of the house had known in what hour the thief was coming, he would
have watched, and not allowed his house to be broken into.
</span> <span class="verse"> 40</span><a name="C12V40">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Therefore be ready also, for the Son of Man is coming in an hour that you don’t expect him.”</span></div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 41</span><a name="C12V41">&nbsp;</a>Peter said to him, “Lord, are you telling this parable to us, or to everybody?”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 42</span><a name="C12V42">&nbsp;</a>The Lord said,
<span class="wj">“Who then is the faithful and wise steward, whom his lord will set over his household, to give them their
portion of food at the right times?
</span> <span class="verse"> 43</span><a name="C12V43">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Blessed is that servant whom his lord will find doing so when he comes.
</span> <span class="verse"> 44</span><a name="C12V44">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Truly I tell you, that he will set him over all that he has.
</span> <span class="verse"> 45</span><a name="C12V45">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">But if that servant says in his heart, ‘My lord delays his coming,’ and begins to beat the menservants
and the maidservants, and to eat and drink, and to be drunken,
</span> <span class="verse"> 46</span><a name="C12V46">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">then the lord of that servant will come in a day when he isn’t expecting him, and in an hour that he
doesn’t know, and will cut him in two, and place his portion with the unfaithful.
</span> <span class="verse"> 47</span><a name="C12V47">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">That servant, who knew his lord’s will, and didn’t prepare, nor do what he wanted, will be beaten with
many stripes,
</span> <span class="verse"> 48</span><a name="C12V48">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">but he who didn’t know, and did things worthy of stripes, will be beaten with few stripes. To whomever
much is given, of him will much be required; and to whom much was entrusted, of him more will be asked.

</span> <span class="verse"> 51</span><a name="C12V51">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Do you think that I have come to give peace in the earth? I tell you, no, but rather division.
</span> <span class="verse"> 52</span><a name="C12V52">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">For from now on, there will be five in one house divided, three against two, and two against three.
</span> <span class="verse"> 53</span><a name="C12V53">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">They will be divided, father against son, and son against father; mother against daughter, and daughter
