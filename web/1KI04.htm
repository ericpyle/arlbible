<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C4V20">&nbsp;</a>Judah and Israel were numerous as the sand which is by the sea in multitude, eating and drinking and
making merry.
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C4V21">&nbsp;</a>Solomon ruled over all the kingdoms from the River to the land of the Philistines, and to the border
of Egypt. They brought tribute and served Solomon all the days of his life.
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C4V22">&nbsp;</a>Solomon’s provision for one day was thirty cors<a href="#FN1"><span class="notemark">*</span><span class="popup">1 cor is the same as a homer, or about 55.9 U. S. gallons (liquid) or 211 liters or 6 bushels</span></a>
 of fine flour, sixty measures of meal,
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C4V23">&nbsp;</a>ten head of fat cattle, twenty head of cattle out of the pastures, and one hundred sheep, besides deer,
and gazelles, and roebucks, and fattened fowl.
 <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C4V24">&nbsp;</a>For he had dominion over all on this side the River, from Tiphsah even to Gaza, over all the kings on
this side the River: and he had peace on all sides around him.
 <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C4V25">&nbsp;</a>Judah and Israel lived safely, every man under his vine and under his fig tree, from Dan even to Beersheba,
all the days of Solomon.
 <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C4V26">&nbsp;</a>Solomon had forty thousand stalls of horses for his chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen.
 <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C4V27">&nbsp;</a>Those officers provided food for king Solomon, and for all who came to king Solomon’s table, every man
in his month. They let nothing be lacking.
 <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C4V28">&nbsp;</a>They also brought Barley and straw for the horses and swift steeds to the place where the officers were,
each man according to his duty.
 <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C4V29">&nbsp;</a>God gave Solomon abundant wisdom and understanding, and very great understanding, even as the sand that
is on the seashore.
 <span class="verse"> 30</span><a name="C4V30">&nbsp;</a>Solomon’s wisdom excelled the wisdom of all the children of the east and all the wisdom of Egypt.
 <span class="verse"> 31</span><a name="C4V31">&nbsp;</a>For he was wiser than all men; than Ethan the Ezrahite, Heman, Calcol, and Darda, the sons of Mahol:
and his fame was in all the nations all around.
 <span class="verse"> 32</span><a name="C4V32">&nbsp;</a>He spoke three thousand proverbs; and his songs numbered one thousand five.
 <span class="verse"> 33</span><a name="C4V33">&nbsp;</a>He spoke of trees, from the cedar that is in Lebanon even to the hyssop that grows out of the wall; he
also spoke of animals, of birds, of creeping things, and of fish.
 <span class="verse"> 34</span><a name="C4V34">&nbsp;</a>People of all nations came to hear the wisdom of Solomon, sent by all kings of the earth, who had heard
of his wisdom.
