 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C5V1">&nbsp;</a>It is actually reported that there is sexual immorality among you, and such sexual immorality as is not
even named among the Gentiles, that one has his father’s wife.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C5V2">&nbsp;</a>You are puffed up, and didn’t rather mourn, that he who had done this deed might be removed from among
you.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C5V3">&nbsp;</a>For I most certainly, as being absent in body but present in spirit, have already, as though I were present,
judged him who has done this thing.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C5V4">&nbsp;</a>In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, you being gathered together, and my spirit, with the power of our
Lord Jesus Christ,
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C5V5">&nbsp;</a>are to deliver such a one to Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in
the day of the Lord Jesus.

<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C5V6">&nbsp;</a>Your boasting is not good. Don’t you know that a little yeast leavens the whole lump?
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C5V7">&nbsp;</a>Purge out the old yeast, that you may be a new lump, even as you are unleavened. For indeed Christ, our
Passover, has been sacrificed in our place.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C5V8">&nbsp;</a>Therefore let us keep the feast, not with old yeast, neither with the yeast of malice and wickedness,
but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C5V9">&nbsp;</a>I wrote to you in my letter to have no company with sexual sinners;
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C5V10">&nbsp;</a>yet not at all meaning with the sexual sinners of this world, or with the covetous and extortionists,
or with idolaters; for then you would have to leave the world.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C5V11">&nbsp;</a>But as it is, I wrote to you not to associate with anyone who is called a brother who is a sexual sinner,
or covetous, or an idolater, or a slanderer, or a drunkard, or an extortionist. Don’t even eat with such
a person.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C5V12">&nbsp;</a>For what do I have to do with also judging those who are outside? Don’t you judge those who are within?
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C5V13">&nbsp;</a>But those who are outside, God judges. “Put away the wicked man from among yourselves.”<a href="#FN1"><span class="notemark"></span><span class="popup">+ Deuteronomy 17:7; 19:19; 21:21; 22:21; 24:7</span></a>
