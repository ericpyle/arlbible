 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C15V1">&nbsp;</a>Behold, speak you in the ears of my people the words of prophecy, which I will put in your mouth, says
the Lord:
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C15V2">&nbsp;</a>and cause you them to be written in paper: for they are faithful and true.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C15V3">&nbsp;</a>Fear not their imaginations against you, let not the unbelief of them that speak against you trouble
you.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C15V4">&nbsp;</a>For all the unbelievers shall die in their unbelief.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C15V5">&nbsp;</a>Behold, says the Lord, I bring evils upon the whole earth; sword and famine, and death and destruction.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C15V6">&nbsp;</a>For wickedness has prevailed over every land, and their hurtful works are come to the full.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C15V7">&nbsp;</a>Therefore says the Lord,
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C15V8">&nbsp;</a>I will hold my peace no more as touching their wickedness, which they profanely commit, neither will
I suffer them in these things, which they wickedly practise: behold, the innocent and righteous blood
cries to me, and the souls of the righteous cry out continually.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C15V9">&nbsp;</a>I will surely avenge them, says the Lord, and will receive to me all the innocent blood from among them.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C15V10">&nbsp;</a>Behold, my people is led as a flock to the slaughter: I will not suffer them now to dwell in the land
of Egypt:
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C15V11">&nbsp;</a>but I will bring them out with a mighty hand and with a high arm, and will strike Egypt with plagues,
as aforetime, and will destroy all the land thereof.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C15V12">&nbsp;</a>Let Egypt mourn, and the foundations thereof, for the plague of the chastisement and the punishment that
God shall bring upon it.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C15V13">&nbsp;</a>Let the husbandmen that till the ground mourn: for their seeds shall fail and their trees shall be laid
waste through the blasting and hail, and a terrible star.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C15V14">&nbsp;</a>Woe to the world and them that dwell therein!
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C15V15">&nbsp;</a>for the sword and their destruction draweth near, and nation shall rise up against nation to battle with
weapons in their hands.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C15V16">&nbsp;</a>For there shall be sedition among men; and waxing strong one against another, they shall not regard their
king nor the chief of their great ones, in their might.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C15V17">&nbsp;</a>For a man shall desire to go into a city, and shall not be able.
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C15V18">&nbsp;</a>For because of their pride the cities shall be troubled, the houses shall be destroyed,
<span class="add">and
</span> men shall be afraid.
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C15V19">&nbsp;</a>A man shall have no pity upon his neighbor, but shall make an assault on their houses with the sword,
and spoil their goods, because of the lack of bread, and for great tribulation.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C15V20">&nbsp;</a>Behold, says God, I call together all the kings of the earth, to stir up them that are from the rising
of the sun, from the south, from the east, and Libanus; to turn themselves one against another, and repay
the things that they have done to them.
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C15V21">&nbsp;</a>Like as they do yet this day to my chosen, so will I do also, and recompense in their bosom. Thus says
the Lord God:
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C15V22">&nbsp;</a>My right hand shall not spare the sinners, and my sword shall not cease over them that shed innocent
blood upon the earth.
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C15V23">&nbsp;</a>And a fire is gone forth from his wrath, and has consumed the foundations of the earth, and the sinners,
like the straw that is kindled.
 <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C15V24">&nbsp;</a>Woe to them that sin, and keep not my commandments! says the Lord.
 <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C15V25">&nbsp;</a>I will not spare them: go your way, you⌃ rebellious children, defile not my sanctuary.
 <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C15V26">&nbsp;</a>For the Lord knows all them that trespass against him, therefore has he delivered them to death and destruction.
 <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C15V27">&nbsp;</a>For now are the evils come upon the whole earth, and you⌃ shall remain in them: for God shall not deliver
you, because you⌃ have sinned against him.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C15V28">&nbsp;</a>Behold, a vision horrible, and the appearance thereof from the east!
 <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C15V29">&nbsp;</a>And the nations of the dragons of Arabia shall come out with many chariots, and from the day that they
set forth the hissing of them is carried over the earth, so that all they which shall hear them may fear
also and tremble.
 <span class="verse"> 30</span><a name="C15V30">&nbsp;</a>Also the Carmonians raging in wrath shall go forth as the wild boars of the wood, and with great power
shall they come, and join battle with them, and shall waste a portion of the land of the Assyrians with
their teeth.
 <span class="verse"> 31</span><a name="C15V31">&nbsp;</a>And then shall the dragons have the upper hand, remembering their

 nature; and if they shall turn themselves, conspiring together in great power to persecute them,
 <span class="verse"> 32</span><a name="C15V32">&nbsp;</a>then these shall be troubled, and keep silence through their power, and shall turn and flee.
 <span class="verse"> 33</span><a name="C15V33">&nbsp;</a>And from the land of the Assyrians shall the lier in wait besiege them, and consume one of them, and
upon their host shall be fear and trembling, and sedition against their kings.
 <span class="verse"> 34</span><a name="C15V34">&nbsp;</a>Behold, clouds from the east and from the north to the south, and they are very horrible to look upon,
full of wrath and storm.
 <span class="verse"> 35</span><a name="C15V35">&nbsp;</a>They shall dash one against another, and they shall pour out a plentiful

 storm upon the earth, even their own star; and there shall be blood from the sword to the horse’s belly,
 <span class="verse"> 36</span><a name="C15V36">&nbsp;</a>and to the thigh of man, and to the camel’s hough.
 <span class="verse"> 37</span><a name="C15V37">&nbsp;</a>And there shall be fearfulness and great trembling upon earth: and they that see that wrath shall be
afraid, and trembling shall take hold upon them.
 <span class="verse"> 38</span><a name="C15V38">&nbsp;</a>And after this shall there be stirred up great storms from the south, and from the north, and another
part from the west.
 <span class="verse"> 39</span><a name="C15V39">&nbsp;</a>And strong winds shall arise from the east, and shall shut it up, even the cloud which he raised up in
wrath; and the star that was to cause destruction by the east wind shall be violently driven toward the
south and west.
 <span class="verse"> 40</span><a name="C15V40">&nbsp;</a>And great clouds and mighty and full of wrath shall be lifted up, and the star, that they may destroy
all the earth, and them that dwell therein; and they shall pour out over every high and eminent one a
terrible star,
 <span class="verse"> 41</span><a name="C15V41">&nbsp;</a>fire, and hail, and flying swords, and many waters, that all plains may be full, and all rivers, with
the abundance of those waters.
 <span class="verse"> 42</span><a name="C15V42">&nbsp;</a>And they shall break down the cities and walls, mountains and hills, trees of the wood, and grass of
the meadows, and their corn.
 <span class="verse"> 43</span><a name="C15V43">&nbsp;</a>And they shall go on stedfastly to Babylon, and destroy her.
 <span class="verse"> 44</span><a name="C15V44">&nbsp;</a>They shall come to her, and compass her about; the star and all wrath shall they pour out upon her: then
shall the dust and smoke go up to the heaven, and all they that be about her shall bewail her.
 <span class="verse"> 45</span><a name="C15V45">&nbsp;</a>And they that remain shall do service to them that have put her in fear.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 46</span><a name="C15V46">&nbsp;</a>And you, Asia, that are partaker in the beauty of Babylon, and in the glory of her person:
 <span class="verse"> 47</span><a name="C15V47">&nbsp;</a>woe to you, you wretch, because you have made yourself like to her; you have decked your daughters in
whoredom, that they might please and glory in your lovers, which have always desired you to commit whoredom
withal!
 <span class="verse"> 48</span><a name="C15V48">&nbsp;</a>You have followed her that is hateful in all her works and inventions: therefore says God,
 <span class="verse"> 49</span><a name="C15V49">&nbsp;</a>I will send evils upon you; widowhood, poverty, famine, sword, and pestilence, to waste your houses to
destruction and death.
 <span class="verse"> 50</span><a name="C15V50">&nbsp;</a>And the glory of your power shall be dried up as a flower, when the heat shall arise that is sent over
you.

 <span class="verse"> 56</span><a name="C15V56">&nbsp;</a>Like as you shall do to my chosen, says the Lord, even so shall God do to you, and shall deliver you
into mischief.
 <span class="verse"> 57</span><a name="C15V57">&nbsp;</a>And your children shall die of hunger, and you shall fall by the sword: and your cities shall be broken
down, and all your shall perish by the sword in the field.

again to Babylon that was destroyed.

trees shall they burn up with fire.
