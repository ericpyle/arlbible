three days in the wilderness, and found no water.
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C15V23">&nbsp;</a>When they came to Marah, they couldn’t drink from the waters of Marah, for they were bitter. Therefore
its name was called Marah.<a href="#FN1"><span class="notemark">*</span><span class="popup">Marah means bitter.</span></a>
 <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C15V24">&nbsp;</a>The people murmured against Moses, saying, “What shall we drink?”
 <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C15V25">&nbsp;</a>Then he cried to Yahweh. Yahweh showed him a tree, and he threw it into the waters, and the waters were
made sweet. There he made a statute and an ordinance for them, and there he tested them;
 <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C15V26">&nbsp;</a>and he said, “If you will diligently listen to Yahweh your God’s voice, and will do that which is right
in his eyes, and will pay attention to his commandments, and keep all his statutes, I will put none of
the diseases on you, which I have put on the Egyptians; for I am Yahweh who heals you.”

there by the waters.
