 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C13V1">&nbsp;</a>“In that day there will be a spring opened to David’s house and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, for
sin and for uncleanness.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C13V2">&nbsp;</a>It will come to pass in that day, says Yahweh of Armies, that I will cut off the names of the idols out
of the land, and they will be remembered no more. I will also cause the prophets and the spirit of impurity
to pass out of the land.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C13V3">&nbsp;</a>It will happen that, when anyone still prophesies, then his father and his mother who bore him will tell
him, ‘You must die, because you speak lies in Yahweh’s name;’ and his father and his mother who bore
him will stab him when he prophesies.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C13V4">&nbsp;</a>It will happen in that day, that the prophets will each be ashamed of his vision, when he prophesies;
neither will they wear a hairy mantle to deceive:
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C13V5">&nbsp;</a>but he will say, ‘I am no prophet, I am a tiller of the ground; for I have been made a bondservant from
my youth.’
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C13V6">&nbsp;</a>One will say to him, ‘What are these wounds between your arms?’ Then he will answer, ‘Those with which
I was wounded in the house of my friends.’

<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C13V7">&nbsp;</a>“Awake, sword, against my shepherd,
</div>
<div class="q2">and against the man who is close to me,” says Yahweh of Armies.
</div>
<div class="q1">“Strike the shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered;
</div>
<div class="q2">and I will turn my hand against the little ones.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C13V8">&nbsp;</a>It shall happen that in all the land,” says Yahweh,
</div>
<div class="q2">“two parts in it will be cut off and die;
</div>
<div class="q2">but the third will be left in it.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C13V9">&nbsp;</a>I will bring the third part into the fire,
</div>
<div class="q2">and will refine them as silver is refined,
</div>
<div class="q2">and will test them like gold is tested.
</div>
<div class="q1">They will call on my name, and I will hear them.
</div>
<div class="q2">I will say, ‘It is my people;’
</div>
<div class="q2">and they will say, ‘Yahweh is my God.’”
