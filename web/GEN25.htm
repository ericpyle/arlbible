 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C25V1">&nbsp;</a>Abraham took another wife, and her name was Keturah.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C25V2">&nbsp;</a>She bore him Zimran, Jokshan, Medan, Midian, Ishbak, and Shuah.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C25V3">&nbsp;</a>Jokshan became the father of Sheba, and Dedan. The sons of Dedan were Asshurim, Letushim, and Leummim.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C25V4">&nbsp;</a>The sons of Midian were: Ephah, Epher, Hanoch, Abida, and Eldaah. All these were the children of Keturah.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C25V5">&nbsp;</a>Abraham gave all that he had to Isaac,
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C25V6">&nbsp;</a>but to the sons of Abraham’s concubines, Abraham gave gifts. He sent them away from Isaac his son, while
he yet lived, eastward, to the east country.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C25V7">&nbsp;</a>These are the days of the years of Abraham’s life which he lived: one hundred seventy-five years.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C25V8">&nbsp;</a>Abraham gave up his spirit, and died in a good old age, an old man, and full of years, and was gathered
to his people.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C25V9">&nbsp;</a>Isaac and Ishmael, his sons, buried him in the cave of Machpelah, in the field of Ephron, the son of
Zohar the Hittite, which is before Mamre,
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C25V10">&nbsp;</a>the field which Abraham purchased of the children of Heth. Abraham was buried there with Sarah, his wife.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C25V11">&nbsp;</a>After the death of Abraham, God blessed Isaac, his son. Isaac lived by Beer Lahai Roi.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C25V12">&nbsp;</a>Now this is the history of the generations of Ishmael, Abraham’s son, whom Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah’s
servant, bore to Abraham.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C25V13">&nbsp;</a>These are the names of the sons of Ishmael, by their names, according to the order of their birth: the
firstborn of Ishmael, Nebaioth, then Kedar, Adbeel, Mibsam,
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C25V14">&nbsp;</a>Mishma, Dumah, Massa,
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C25V15">&nbsp;</a>Hadad, Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C25V16">&nbsp;</a>These are the sons of Ishmael, and these are their names, by their villages, and by their encampments:
twelve princes, according to their nations.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C25V17">&nbsp;</a>These are the years of the life of Ishmael: one hundred thirty-seven years. He gave up his spirit and
died, and was gathered to his people.
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C25V18">&nbsp;</a>They lived from Havilah to Shur that is before Egypt, as you go toward Assyria. He lived opposite all
his relatives.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C25V19">&nbsp;</a>This is the history of the generations of Isaac, Abraham’s son. Abraham became the father of Isaac.
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C25V20">&nbsp;</a>Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah, the daughter of Bethuel the Syrian of Paddan Aram, the
sister of Laban the Syrian, to be his wife.
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C25V21">&nbsp;</a>Isaac entreated Yahweh for his wife, because she was barren. Yahweh was entreated by him, and Rebekah
his wife conceived.
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C25V22">&nbsp;</a>The children struggled together within her. She said, “If it is so, why do I live?” She went to inquire
of Yahweh.
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C25V23">&nbsp;</a>Yahweh said to her,
</div>
<div class="q1">“Two nations are in your womb.
</div>
<div class="q1">Two peoples will be separated from your body.
</div>
<div class="q1">The one people will be stronger than the other people.
</div>
<div class="q1">The elder will serve the younger.”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C25V24">&nbsp;</a>When her days to be delivered were fulfilled, behold, there were twins in her womb.
 <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C25V25">&nbsp;</a>The first came out red all over, like a hairy garment. They named him Esau.
 <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C25V26">&nbsp;</a>After that, his brother came out, and his hand had hold on Esau’s heel. He was named Jacob. Isaac was
sixty years old when she bore them.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C25V27">&nbsp;</a>The boys grew. Esau was a skillful hunter, a man of the field. Jacob was a quiet man, living in tents.
 <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C25V28">&nbsp;</a>Now Isaac loved Esau, because he ate his venison. Rebekah loved Jacob.
 <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C25V29">&nbsp;</a>Jacob boiled stew. Esau came in from the field, and he was famished.
 <span class="verse"> 30</span><a name="C25V30">&nbsp;</a>Esau said to Jacob, “Please feed me with that same red stew, for I am famished.” Therefore his name was
called Edom.<a href="#FN1"><span class="notemark">*</span><span class="popup">“Edom” means “red”.</span></a>
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 31</span><a name="C25V31">&nbsp;</a>Jacob said, “First, sell me your birthright.”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 32</span><a name="C25V32">&nbsp;</a>Esau said, “Behold, I am about to die. What good is the birthright to me?”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 33</span><a name="C25V33">&nbsp;</a>Jacob said, “Swear to me first.”
</div>
<div class="p">He swore to him. He sold his birthright to Jacob.
 <span class="verse"> 34</span><a name="C25V34">&nbsp;</a>Jacob gave Esau bread and stew of lentils. He ate and drank, rose up, and went his way. So Esau despised
his birthright.
