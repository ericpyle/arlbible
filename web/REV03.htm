 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C3V1">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">“And to the angel of the assembly in Sardis write:</span></div>
<div class="p"><span class="wj">“He who has the seven Spirits of God, and the seven stars says these things:</span></div>
<div class="p"><span class="wj">“I know your works, that you have a reputation of being alive, but you are dead.
</span> <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C3V2">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Wake up, and keep the things that remain, which you were about to throw away, for I have found no works
of yours perfected before my God.
</span> <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C3V3">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Remember therefore how you have received and heard. Keep it, and repent. If therefore you won’t watch,
I will come as a thief, and you won’t know what hour I will come upon you.
</span> <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C3V4">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Nevertheless you have a few names in Sardis that did not defile their garments. They will walk with me
in white, for they are worthy.
</span> <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C3V5">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">He who overcomes will be arrayed in white garments, and I will in no way blot his name out of the book
of life, and I will confess his name before my Father, and before his angels.
</span> <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C3V6">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the assemblies.</span></div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C3V7">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">“To the angel of the assembly in Philadelphia write:</span></div>
<div class="p"><span class="wj">“He who is holy, he who is true, he who has the key of David, he who opens and no one can shut, and who
shuts and no one opens, says these things:
</span></div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C3V8">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">“I know your works (behold, I have set before you an open door, which no one can shut), that you have
a little power, and kept my word, and didn’t deny my name.
</span> <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C3V9">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Behold, I give some of the synagogue of Satan, of those who say they are Jews, and they are not, but
lie. Behold, I will make them to come and worship before your feet, and to know that I have loved you.
</span> <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C3V10">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Because you kept my command to endure, I also will keep you from the hour of testing, which is to come
on the whole world, to test those who dwell on the earth.
</span> <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C3V11">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">I am coming quickly! Hold firmly that which you have, so that no one takes your crown.
</span> <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C3V12">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">He who overcomes, I will make him a pillar in the temple of my God, and he will go out from there no
more. I will write on him the name of my God, and the name of the city of my God, the new Jerusalem,
which comes down out of heaven from my God, and my own new name.

<div class="p"><span class="wj">“The Amen, the Faithful and True Witness, the Head of God’s creation, says these things:</span></div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C3V15">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">“I know your works, that you are neither cold nor hot. I wish you were cold or hot.
</span> <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C3V16">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">So, because you are lukewarm, and neither hot nor cold, I will vomit you out of my mouth.
</span> <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C3V17">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Because you say, ‘I am rich, and have gotten riches, and have need of nothing;’ and don’t know that you
are the wretched one, miserable, poor, blind, and naked;
</span> <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C3V18">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">I counsel you to buy from me gold refined by fire, that you may become rich; and white garments, that
you may clothe yourself, and that the shame of your nakedness may not be revealed; and eye salve to anoint
your eyes, that you may see.
</span> <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C3V19">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">As many as I love, I reprove and chasten. Be zealous therefore, and repent.
</span> <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C3V20">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Behold, I stand at the door and knock. If anyone hears my voice and opens the door, then I will come
in to him, and will dine with him, and he with me.
</span> <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C3V21">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">He who overcomes, I will give to him to sit down with me on my throne, as I also overcame, and sat down
with my Father on his throne.
</span> <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C3V22">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the assemblies.”</span></div>
