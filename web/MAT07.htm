</span> <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C7V2">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">For with whatever judgment you judge, you will be judged; and with whatever measure you measure, it will
be measured to you.
</span> <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C7V3">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Why do you see the speck that is in your brother’s eye, but don’t consider the beam that is in your own
eye?
</span> <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C7V4">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Or how will you tell your brother, ‘Let me remove the speck from your eye;’ and behold, the beam is in
your own eye?
</span> <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C7V5">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">You hypocrite! First remove the beam out of your own eye, and then you can see clearly to remove the
speck out of your brother’s eye.</span></div>

trample them under their feet, and turn and tear you to pieces.</span></div>

</span> <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C7V8">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">For everyone who asks receives. He who seeks finds. To him who knocks it will be opened.
</span> <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C7V9">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Or who is there among you, who, if his son asks him for bread, will give him a stone?
</span> <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C7V10">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Or if he asks for a fish, who will give him a serpent?

who is in heaven give good things to those who ask him!
</span> <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C7V12">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Therefore whatever you desire for men to do to you, you shall also do to them; for this is the law and
the prophets.</span></div>

</span> <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C7V21">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Not everyone who says to me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ will enter into the Kingdom of Heaven; but he who does the
will of my Father who is in heaven.
</span> <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C7V22">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Many will tell me in that day, ‘Lord, Lord, didn’t we prophesy in your name, in your name cast out demons,
and in your name do many mighty works?’
</span> <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C7V23">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Then I will tell them, ‘I never knew you. Depart from me, you who work iniquity.’</span></div>

built his house on a rock.
</span> <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C7V25">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">The rain came down, the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat on that house; and it didn’t fall,
for it was founded on the rock.
</span> <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C7V26">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Everyone who hears these words of mine, and doesn’t do them will be like a foolish man, who built his
house on the sand.

was its fall.”</span></div>
