<div class="mt2">or, The Preacher
</div>
<div class="chapterlabel"> 1</div><div class="p">
 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C1V1">&nbsp;</a>The words of the Preacher, the son of David, king in Jerusalem:
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C1V2">&nbsp;</a>“Vanity of vanities,” says the Preacher; “Vanity of vanities, all is vanity.”
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C1V3">&nbsp;</a>What does man gain from all his labor in which he labors under the sun?
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C1V4">&nbsp;</a>One generation goes, and another generation comes; but the earth remains forever.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C1V5">&nbsp;</a>The sun also rises, and the sun goes down, and hurries to its place where it rises.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C1V6">&nbsp;</a>The wind goes toward the south, and turns around to the north. It turns around continually as it goes,
and the wind returns again to its courses.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C1V7">&nbsp;</a>All the rivers run into the sea, yet the sea is not full. To the place where the rivers flow, there they
flow again.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C1V8">&nbsp;</a>All things are full of weariness beyond uttering. The eye is not satisfied with seeing, nor the ear filled
with hearing.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C1V9">&nbsp;</a>That which has been is that which shall be; and that which has been done is that which shall be done:
and there is no new thing under the sun.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C1V10">&nbsp;</a>Is there a thing of which it may be said, “Behold,<a href="#FN1"><span class="notemark">*</span><span class="popup">“Behold”, from “הִנֵּה”, means look at, take notice, observe, see, or gaze at. It is often used as an
interjection.</span></a>
 this is new?” It has been long ago, in the ages which were before us.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C1V11">&nbsp;</a>There is no memory of the former; neither shall there be any memory of the latter that are to come, among
those that shall come after.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C1V12">&nbsp;</a>I, the Preacher, was king over Israel in Jerusalem.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C1V13">&nbsp;</a>I applied my heart to seek and to search out by wisdom concerning all that is done under the sky. It
is a heavy burden that God<a href="#FN2"><span class="notemark">†</span><span class="popup">The Hebrew word rendered “God” is “אֱלֹהִ֑ים” (Elohim).</span></a>
 has given to the sons of men to be afflicted with.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C1V14">&nbsp;</a>I have seen all the works that are done under the sun; and behold, all is vanity and a chasing after
wind.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C1V15">&nbsp;</a>That which is crooked can’t be made straight; and that which is lacking can’t be counted.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C1V16">&nbsp;</a>I said to myself, “Behold, I have obtained for myself great wisdom above all who were before me in Jerusalem.
Yes, my heart has had great experience of wisdom and knowledge.”
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C1V17">&nbsp;</a>I applied my heart to know wisdom, and to know madness and folly. I perceived that this also was a chasing
after wind.
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C1V18">&nbsp;</a>For in much wisdom is much grief; and he who increases knowledge increases sorrow.
