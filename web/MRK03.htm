 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C3V1">&nbsp;</a>He entered again into the synagogue, and there was a man there who had his hand withered.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C3V2">&nbsp;</a>They watched him, whether he would heal him on the Sabbath day, that they might accuse him.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C3V3">&nbsp;</a>He said to the man who had his hand withered,
<span class="wj">“Stand up.”</span> <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C3V4">&nbsp;</a>He said to them,
<span class="wj">“Is it lawful on the Sabbath day to do good, or to do harm? To save a life, or to kill?”</span> But they were silent.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C3V5">&nbsp;</a>When he had looked around at them with anger, being grieved at the hardening of their hearts, he said
to the man,
<span class="wj">“Stretch out your hand.”
</span> He stretched it out, and his hand was restored as healthy as the other.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C3V6">&nbsp;</a>The Pharisees went out, and immediately conspired with the Herodians against him, how they might destroy
him.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C3V7">&nbsp;</a>Jesus withdrew to the sea with his disciples, and a great multitude followed him from Galilee, from Judea,
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C3V8">&nbsp;</a>from Jerusalem, from Idumaea, beyond the Jordan, and those from around Tyre and Sidon. A great multitude,
hearing what great things he did, came to him.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C3V9">&nbsp;</a>He spoke to his disciples that a little boat should stay near him because of the crowd, so that they
wouldn’t press on him.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C3V10">&nbsp;</a>For he had healed many, so that as many as had diseases pressed on him that they might touch him.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C3V11">&nbsp;</a>The unclean spirits, whenever they saw him, fell down before him, and cried, “You are the Son of God!”
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C3V12">&nbsp;</a>He sternly warned them that they should not make him known.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C3V13">&nbsp;</a>He went up into the mountain, and called to himself those whom he wanted, and they went to him.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C3V14">&nbsp;</a>He appointed twelve, that they might be with him, and that he might send them out to preach,
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C3V15">&nbsp;</a>and to have authority to heal sicknesses and to cast out demons:
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C3V16">&nbsp;</a>Simon (to whom he gave the name Peter);
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C3V17">&nbsp;</a>James the son of Zebedee; and John, the brother of James, (whom he called them Boanerges, which means,
Sons of Thunder);
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C3V18">&nbsp;</a>Andrew; Philip; Bartholomew; Matthew; Thomas; James, the son of Alphaeus; Thaddaeus; Simon the Zealot;
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C3V19">&nbsp;</a>and Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed him.
</div>
<div class="p">Then he came into a house.
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C3V20">&nbsp;</a>The multitude came together again, so that they could not so much as eat bread.
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C3V21">&nbsp;</a>When his friends heard it, they went out to seize him: for they said, “He is insane.”
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C3V22">&nbsp;</a>The scribes who came down from Jerusalem said, “He has Beelzebul,” and, “By the prince of the demons
he casts out the demons.”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C3V23">&nbsp;</a>He summoned them, and said to them in parables,
<span class="wj">“How can Satan cast out Satan?
</span> <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C3V24">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">If a kingdom is divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand.
</span> <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C3V25">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">If a house is divided against itself, that house cannot stand.
</span> <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C3V26">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">If Satan has risen up against himself, and is divided, he can’t stand, but has an end.
</span> <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C3V27">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">But no one can enter into the house of the strong man to plunder, unless he first binds the strong man;
and then he will plunder his house.
</span> <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C3V28">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Most certainly I tell you, all sins of the descendants of man will be forgiven, including their blasphemies
with which they may blaspheme;
</span> <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C3V29">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">but whoever may blaspheme against the Holy Spirit never has forgiveness, but is subject to eternal condemnation.”<a href="#FN1"><span class="notemark">*</span><span class="popup">NU reads, guilty of an eternal sin.</span></a>
</span> <span class="verse"> 30</span><a name="C3V30">&nbsp;</a>—because they said, “He has an unclean spirit.”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 31</span><a name="C3V31">&nbsp;</a>His mother and his brothers came, and standing outside, they sent to him, calling him.
 <span class="verse"> 32</span><a name="C3V32">&nbsp;</a>A multitude was sitting around him, and they told him, “Behold, your mother, your brothers, and your
sisters<a href="#FN2"><span class="notemark">†</span><span class="popup">TR omits “your sisters”</span></a>
 are outside looking for you.”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 33</span><a name="C3V33">&nbsp;</a>He answered them,
<span class="wj">“Who are my mother and my brothers?”</span> <span class="verse"> 34</span><a name="C3V34">&nbsp;</a>Looking around at those who sat around him, he said,
<span class="wj">“Behold, my mother and my brothers!
</span> <span class="verse"> 35</span><a name="C3V35">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">For whoever does the will of God, the same is my brother, and my sister, and mother.”</span></div>
