 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C5V1">&nbsp;</a>Nevertheless as concerning the tokens, behold, the days shall come, that they which dwell upon earth
shall be taken
<a href="#FN1"><span class="notemark">*</span><span class="popup">So the syriac.
</span></a>
 with great amazement, and the way of truth shall be hidden, and the land shall be barren of faith.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C5V2">&nbsp;</a>But iniquity shall be increased above that which now you see, or that you have heard long ago.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C5V3">&nbsp;</a>And the land, that you see now to have rule, shall be waste and
<a href="#FN2"><span class="notemark">†</span><span class="popup">So the Syriac.
</span></a>
 untrodden, and men shall see it desolate.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C5V4">&nbsp;</a>But if the Most High grant you to live, you shall see that which is after the third
<span class="add">kingdom
</span> to be troubled; and the sun shall suddenly shine forth in the night, and the moon in the day:
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C5V5">&nbsp;</a>and blood shall drop out of wood, and the stone shall give his voice, and the peoples shall be troubled;

<span class="add">their</span> goings shall be changed:
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C5V6">&nbsp;</a>and he shall rule, whom they that dwell upon the earth look not for, and the fowls shall take their flight
away together:
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C5V7">&nbsp;</a>and the Sodomite sea shall cast out fish, and make a noise in the night, which many have not known: but
all shall hear the voice thereof.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C5V8">&nbsp;</a>There shall be chaos also in many places, and the fire shall be often sent out, and the wild beasts shall
change their places, and women shall bring forth monsters:
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C5V9">&nbsp;</a>and salt waters shall be found in the sweet, and all friends shall destroy one another; then shall wit
hide itself, and understanding withdraw itself into its chamber;
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C5V10">&nbsp;</a>and it shall be sought of many, and shall not be found: and unrighteousness and incontinency shall be
multiplied upon earth.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C5V11">&nbsp;</a>One land also shall ask another, and say, Is righteousness, is a man that does righteousness, gone through
you? And it shall say, No.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C5V12">&nbsp;</a>And it shall come to pass at that time that men shall hope, but shall not obtain: they shall labor, but
their ways shall not prosper.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C5V13">&nbsp;</a>To show you such tokens I have leave; and if you will pray again, and weep as now, and fast seven days,
you shall hear yet greater things than these.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C5V14">&nbsp;</a>Then I awaked, and an extreme trembling went through my body, and my mind was troubled, so that it fainted.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C5V15">&nbsp;</a>So the angel that was come to talk with me held me, comforted me, and set me up upon my feet.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C5V16">&nbsp;</a>And in the second night it came to pass, that
<a href="#FN4"><span class="notemark">§</span><span class="popup">The Syriac has
Psaltiel.
</span></a>
 Phaltiel the captain of the people came to me, saying, Where have you been? and why is your countenance
sad?
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C5V17">&nbsp;</a>or know you not that Israel is committed to you in the land of their captivity?
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C5V18">&nbsp;</a>Up then, and eat some bread, and forsake us not, as the shepherd
<span class="add">that leaves
</span> in the hands of cruel wolves.
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C5V19">&nbsp;</a>Then said I to him, Go your ways from me, and come not near me for seven days, and then shall you come
to me. And he heard what I said, and went from me.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C5V20">&nbsp;</a>And so I fasted seven days, mourning and weeping, like as Uriel the angel commanded me.
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C5V21">&nbsp;</a>And after seven days, so it was, that the thoughts of my heart were very grievous to me again,
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C5V22">&nbsp;</a>and my soul recovered the spirit of understanding, and I began to speak words before the Most High again,
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C5V23">&nbsp;</a>and said, O Lord that bear rule, of all the woods of the earth, and of all the trees thereof, you have
chosen you one vine:
 <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C5V24">&nbsp;</a>and of all the lands of the world you have chosen you one

</span></a>
 country: and of all the flowers of the world you have chosen you one lily:
 <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C5V25">&nbsp;</a>and of all the depths of the sea you have filled you one river: and of all builded cities you have hallowed
Sion to yourself:
 <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C5V26">&nbsp;</a>and of all the fowls that are created you have named you one dove: and of all the cattle that are made
you have provided you one sheep:
 <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C5V27">&nbsp;</a>and among all the multitudes of peoples you have gotten you one people: and to this people, whom you
loved, you gave a law that is approved of all.
 <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C5V28">&nbsp;</a>And now, O Lord, why have you given this one people over to many, and
<a href="#FN6"><span class="notemark">††</span><span class="popup">After the Oriental versions. The Latin reads
have prepared.</span></a>
 have dishonored the one root above others, and have scattered your only one among many?
 <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C5V29">&nbsp;</a>And they which did gainsay your promises have trodden them down that believed your covenants.
 <span class="verse"> 30</span><a name="C5V30">&nbsp;</a>If you do so much hate your people, they should be punished with your own hands.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 31</span><a name="C5V31">&nbsp;</a>Now when I had spoken these words, the angel that came to me the night before was sent to me,
 <span class="verse"> 32</span><a name="C5V32">&nbsp;</a>and said to me, Hear me, and I will instruct you; hearken to me, and I shall tell you more.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 33</span><a name="C5V33">&nbsp;</a>And I said, Speak on, my Lord. Then said he to me, You are sore troubled in mind for Israel’s sake: love
you that people better than he that made them?
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 34</span><a name="C5V34">&nbsp;</a>And I said, No, Lord: but of very grief have I spoken: for my reins torment me every hour, while I labor
to comprehend the way of the Most High, and to seek out part of his judgement.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 35</span><a name="C5V35">&nbsp;</a>And he said to me, You can not. And I said, Wherefore, Lord, or whereunto was I born? or why was not
my mother’s womb then my grave, that I might not have seen the travail of Jacob, and the wearisome toil
of the stock of Israel?
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 36</span><a name="C5V36">&nbsp;</a>And he said to me, Number me them that are not yet come, gather me together the drops that are scattered
abroad, make me the flowers green again that are withered,
 <span class="verse"> 37</span><a name="C5V37">&nbsp;</a>open me the chambers that are closed, and bring me forth the winds that in them are shut up, or show
me the image of a voice: and then I will declare to you the travail that you asked to see.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 38</span><a name="C5V38">&nbsp;</a>And I said, O Lord that bear rule, who may know these things, but he that has not his dwelling with men?
 <span class="verse"> 39</span><a name="C5V39">&nbsp;</a>As for me, I am unwise: how may I then speak of these things whereof you asked me?
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 40</span><a name="C5V40">&nbsp;</a>Then said he to me, Like as you can do none of these things that I have spoken of, even so can you not
find out my judgement, or the end of the love that I have promised to my people.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 41</span><a name="C5V41">&nbsp;</a>And I said, But, behold, O Lord, you have made the promise to them that be in the end: and what shall
they do that have been before us, or we
<span class="add">that be now,
</span> or they that shall come after us?
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 42</span><a name="C5V42">&nbsp;</a>And he said to me, I will liken my judgement to a ring: like as there is no slackness of them that be
last, even so there is no swiftness of them that be first.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 43</span><a name="C5V43">&nbsp;</a>So I answered and said, Couldest you not make them
<span class="add">to be
</span> at once that have been made, and that be now, and that are for to come; that you might show your judgment
the sooner?
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 44</span><a name="C5V44">&nbsp;</a>Then answered he me, and said, The creature may not haste above the creator; neither may the world hold
them at once that shall be created therein.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 45</span><a name="C5V45">&nbsp;</a>And I said, How have you said to your servant, that
<a href="#FN7"><span class="notemark">‡‡</span><span class="popup">So the Syriac.
</span></a>
 you will surely make alive at once the creature that you have created?
<a href="#FN8"><span class="notemark">§§</span><span class="popup">The Latin omits
If...alive at once.
</span></a>
 If therefore they shall be alive at once, and the creature shall sustain them: even so it might now
also support them to be present at once.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 46</span><a name="C5V46">&nbsp;</a>And he said to me, Ask the womb of a woman, and say to her, If you bring forth ten children, why
<span class="add">do you it
</span> at several times? pray her therefore to bring forth ten children at once.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 47</span><a name="C5V47">&nbsp;</a>And I said, she can’t: but must do it by distance of time.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 48</span><a name="C5V48">&nbsp;</a>Then said he to me, Even so have I given the womb of the earth to those that be sown therein in their
several times.
 <span class="verse"> 49</span><a name="C5V49">&nbsp;</a>For like as a young child may not bring forth, neither she that is grown old
<span class="add">bring forth
</span> any more, even so have I disposed the world which I created.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 50</span><a name="C5V50">&nbsp;</a>And I asked, and said, Seeing you have now showed me the way, I will speak before you: Is our mother,
of whom you have told me, still young? or does she now draw near to age?
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 51</span><a name="C5V51">&nbsp;</a>He answered me, and said, Ask a woman that bears children, and she shall tell you.
 <span class="verse"> 52</span><a name="C5V52">&nbsp;</a>Say to her, wherefore are not they whom you have now brought forth like those that were before, but less
of stature?
 <span class="verse"> 53</span><a name="C5V53">&nbsp;</a>And she also shall answer you, They that be born in the strength of youth are of one fashion, and they
that are born in the time of age, when the womb fails, are otherwise.
 <span class="verse"> 54</span><a name="C5V54">&nbsp;</a>Consider therefore you also, how that you⌃ are less of stature than those that were before you.
 <span class="verse"> 55</span><a name="C5V55">&nbsp;</a>And so are they that come after you less than you⌃, as
<span class="add">born
</span> of the creature which now begins to be old, and is past the strength of youth.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 56</span><a name="C5V56">&nbsp;</a>Then said I, Lord, I beseech you, if I have found favor in your sight, show your servant by whom you
visit your creature.
