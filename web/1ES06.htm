 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C6V8">&nbsp;</a>To king Darius, greeting: Let all things be known to our lord the king, that being come into the country
of Judaea, and entered into the city of Jerusalem, we found in the city of Jerusalem the elders of the
Jews that were of the captivity
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C6V9">&nbsp;</a>building a house to the Lord, great
<span class="add">and</span> new, of hewn and costly stones, with timber laid in the walls.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C6V10">&nbsp;</a>And those works are done with great speed, and the work goes on prosperously in their hands, and with
all glory and diligence it is accomplished.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C6V11">&nbsp;</a>Then asked we these elders, saying, By whose commandment build you⌃ this house, and lay the foundations
of these works?
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C6V12">&nbsp;</a>Therefore, to the intent that we might give knowledge to you by writing who were the chief doers, we
questioned them, and we required of them the names in writing of their principal men.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C6V13">&nbsp;</a>So they gave us this answer, We are the servants of the Lord which made heaven and earth.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C6V14">&nbsp;</a>And as for this house, it was builded many years ago by a king of Israel great and strong, and was finished.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C6V15">&nbsp;</a>But when our fathers sinned against the Lord of Israel which is in heaven, and provoked him to wrath,
he gave them over into the hands of Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon, king of the Chaldeans;
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C6V16">&nbsp;</a>and they pulled down the house, and burned it, and carried away the people captives to Babylon.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C6V17">&nbsp;</a>But in the first year that Cyrus reigned over the country of Babylon, king Cyrus wrote to build up this
house.
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C6V18">&nbsp;</a>And the holy vessels of gold and of silver, that Nabuchodonosor had carried away out of the house at
Jerusalem, and had set up in his own temple, those Cyrus the king brought forth again out of the temple
in Babylonia, and they were delivered to Zorobabel and to

 all these vessels, and put them in the temple at Jerusalem; and that the temple of the Lord should be
built in its place.
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C6V20">&nbsp;</a>Then Sanabassarus, being come here, laid the foundations of the house of the Lord which is in Jerusalem;
and from that time to this being still a building, it is not yet fully ended.
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C6V21">&nbsp;</a>Now therefore, if it seem good, O king, let search be made among the royal archives of our lord the king
that are in Babylon:
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C6V22">&nbsp;</a>and if it be found that the building of the house of the Lord which is in Jerusalem has been done with
the consent of king Cyrus, and it seem good to our lord the king, let him signify to us thereof.

 roll wherin these things were recorded.
 <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C6V24">&nbsp;</a>In the first year of the reign of Cyrus king Cyrus commanded to build up the house of the Lord which
is in Jerusalem, where they do sacrifice with continual fire:
 <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C6V25">&nbsp;</a>whose height shall be sixty cubits, and the breadth sixty cubits, with three rows of hewn stones, and
one row of new wood of that country; and the expenses therof to be given out of the house of king Cyrus:
 <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C6V26">&nbsp;</a>and that the holy vessels of the house of the Lord, both gold and silver, that Nabuchodonosor took out
of the house at Jerusalem, and carried away to Babylon, should be restored to the house at Jerusalem,
and be set in the place where they were before.
 <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C6V27">&nbsp;</a>And also he commanded that Sisinnes the governor of Syria and Phoenicia, and Sathrabuzanes, and their
companions, and those which were appointed rulers in Syria and Phoenicia, should be careful not to meddle
with the place, but suffer Zorobabel, the servant of the Lord, and governor of Judaea, and the elders
of the Jews, to build that house of the Lord in its place.
 <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C6V28">&nbsp;</a>And I also do command to have it built up whole again; and that they look diligently to help those that
be of the captivity of Judaea, till the house of the Lord be finished:
 <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C6V29">&nbsp;</a>and that out of the tribute of Coelesyria and Phoenicia a portion be carefully given these men for the
sacrifices of the Lord,
<span class="add">that is,</span> to Zorobabel the governor, for bullocks, and rams, and lambs;
 <span class="verse"> 30</span><a name="C6V30">&nbsp;</a>and also corn, salt, wine and oil, and that continually every year without further question, according
as the priests that be in Jerusalem shall signify to be daily spent:
 <span class="verse"> 31</span><a name="C6V31">&nbsp;</a>that drink offerings may be made to the Most High God for the king and for his children, and that they
may pray for their lives.

stretch out his hand to hinder or endamage that house of the Lord in Jerusalem.
