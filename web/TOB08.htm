 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C8V1">&nbsp;</a>And when they had finished their supper, they brought Tobias in to her.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C8V2">&nbsp;</a>But as he went, he remembered the words of Raphael, and took the ashes of the incense, and put the heart
and the liver of the fish thereupon, and made a smoke
<span class="add">therewith.
</span> <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C8V3">&nbsp;</a>But when the

</span></a>
 devil smelled the smell, he fled into the uppermost parts of Egypt, and the angel bound him.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C8V4">&nbsp;</a>But after they were both shut in together, Tobias rose up from the bed, and said, Sister, arise, and
let us pray that the Lord may have mercy on us.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C8V5">&nbsp;</a>And Tobias began to say, Blessed are you, O God of our fathers, and blessed is your holy and glorious
name for ever; let the heavens bless you, and all your creatures.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C8V6">&nbsp;</a>You made Adam, and gave him Eve his wife for a helper and a stay: of them came the seed of men: you did
say, it is not good that the man should be alone; let us make him a helper like to him.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C8V7">&nbsp;</a>And now, O Lord, I take not this my sister for lust, but in truth: command that I may find mercy and
grow old with her.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C8V8">&nbsp;</a>And she said with him, Amen. And they slept both that night.

<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C8V9">&nbsp;</a>And Raguel arose, and went and digged a grave,
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C8V10">&nbsp;</a>saying, Lest he also should die.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C8V11">&nbsp;</a>And Raguel came into his house,
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C8V12">&nbsp;</a>and said to Edna his wife, Send one of the maidservants, and let them see whether he be alive: but if
not, that we may bury him, and no man know it.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C8V13">&nbsp;</a>So the maidservant opened the door, and went in, and found them both sleeping,
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C8V14">&nbsp;</a>and came forth, and told them that he was alive.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C8V15">&nbsp;</a>And Raguel blessed God, saying,
</div>
<div class="p">Blessed are you, O God, with all pure and holy blessing; and let your saints bless you, and all your
creatures; and let all your angels and your elect bless you for ever.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C8V16">&nbsp;</a>Blessed are you, because you have made me glad; and it has not befallen me as I suspected; but you have
dealt with us according to your great mercy.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C8V17">&nbsp;</a>Blessed are you, because you have had mercy on two that were the only begotten children of their parents:
show them mercy, O Lord; accomplish their life in health with gladness and mercy.

<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C8V18">&nbsp;</a>But he commanded his servants to fill the grave.
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C8V19">&nbsp;</a>And he kept the wedding feast for them fourteen days.
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C8V20">&nbsp;</a>And before the days of the wedding feast were finished, Raguel sware to him, that he should not depart
till the fourteen days of the wedding feast were fulfilled;
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C8V21">&nbsp;</a>and that then he should take the half of his goods, and go in safety to his father; and the rest,
<span class="add">said he,
</span> when I and my wife shall die.
