 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C29V1">&nbsp;</a>In the tenth year, in the tenth month, on the twelfth day of the month, Yahweh’s word came to me, saying,
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C29V2">&nbsp;</a>“Son of man, set your face against Pharaoh king of Egypt, and prophesy against him and against all Egypt.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C29V3">&nbsp;</a>Speak and say, ‘Thus says the Lord Yahweh:
</div>
<div class="q1">“Behold, I am against you, Pharaoh king of Egypt,
</div>
<div class="q2">the great monster that lies in the middle of his rivers,
</div>
<div class="q1">that has said, ‘My river is my own,
</div>
<div class="q2">and I have made it for myself.’
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C29V4">&nbsp;</a>I will put hooks in your jaws,
</div>
<div class="q2">and I will make the fish of your rivers stick to your scales;
</div>
<div class="q1">and I will bring you up out of the middle of your rivers,
</div>
<div class="q2">with all the fish of your rivers which stick to your scales.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C29V5">&nbsp;</a>I’ll cast you out into the wilderness,
</div>
<div class="q2">you and all the fish of your rivers.
</div>
<div class="q1">You’ll fall on the open field.
</div>
<div class="q2">You won’t be brought together,
</div>
<div class="q2">nor gathered.
</div>
<div class="q1">I have given you for food to the animals of the earth
</div>
<div class="q2">and to the birds of the sky.

<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C29V6">&nbsp;</a>“‘“All the inhabitants of Egypt will know that I am Yahweh, because they have been a staff of reed to
the house of Israel.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C29V7">&nbsp;</a>When they took hold of you by your hand, you broke, and tore all their shoulders; and when they leaned
on you, you broke, and paralyzed all of their thighs.”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C29V8">&nbsp;</a>“‘Therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh: “Behold, I will bring a sword on you, and will cut off man and
animal from you.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C29V9">&nbsp;</a>The land of Egypt will be a desolation and a waste; and they will know that I am Yahweh.
</div>
<div class="p">“‘“Because he has said, ‘The river is mine, and I have made it;’
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C29V10">&nbsp;</a>therefore, behold, I am against you, and against your rivers, and I will make the land of Egypt an utter
waste and desolation, from the tower of Seveneh even to the border of Ethiopia.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C29V11">&nbsp;</a>No foot of man will pass through it, nor will any animal foot pass through it, neither will it be inhabited
forty years.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C29V12">&nbsp;</a>I will make the land of Egypt a desolation in the middle of the countries that are desolate; and her
cities among the cities that are laid waste will be a desolation forty years; and I will scatter the
Egyptians among the nations, and will disperse them through the countries.”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C29V13">&nbsp;</a>“‘For thus says the Lord Yahweh: “At the end of forty years will I gather the Egyptians from the peoples
where they were scattered;
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C29V14">&nbsp;</a>and I will bring back the captivity of Egypt, and will cause them to return into the land of Pathros,
into the land of their birth; and they will be there a base kingdom.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C29V15">&nbsp;</a>It will be the base of the kingdoms; neither will it any more lift itself up above the nations: and I
will diminish them, that they will no more rule over the nations.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C29V16">&nbsp;</a>It will be no more the confidence of the house of Israel, bringing iniquity to memory, when they turn
to look after them. Then they will know that I am the Lord Yahweh.”’”
</div>
<div class="b"></div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C29V17">&nbsp;</a>It came to pass in the seven and twentieth year, in the first month, in the first day of the month, Yahweh’s
word came to me, saying,
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C29V18">&nbsp;</a>“Son of man, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon caused his army to serve a great service against Tyre. Every
head was made bald, and every shoulder was worn; yet he had no wages, nor his army, from Tyre, for the
service that he had served against it.
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C29V19">&nbsp;</a>Therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh: ‘Behold, I will give the land of Egypt to Nebuchadnezzar king of
Babylon; and he will carry off her multitude, and take her plunder, and take her prey; and it will be
the wages for his army.
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C29V20">&nbsp;</a>I have given him the land of Egypt as his recompense for which he served, because they worked for me,’
says the Lord Yahweh.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C29V21">&nbsp;</a>“In that day I will cause a horn to sprout for the house of Israel, and I will give you the opening of
the mouth among them. Then they will know that I am Yahweh.”
