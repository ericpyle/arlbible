And who is God but Nebuchadnezzar?  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>He will send forth his might, and will destroy them from the face of the earth, and their God will not deliver them: but we his servants will strike them as one man; and they will not sustain the might of our horses.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>For with them we will burn them up, and their mountains will be drunken with their blood, and their plains will be filled with their dead bodies, and their footsteps will not stand before us, but they will surely perish, says king Nebuchadnezzar, lord of all the earth: for he said, The words that <a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> Gr. he has spoken. </span></a> I have spoken will not be in vain.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>But you, Achior, hireling of Ammon, which have spoken these words in the day of your iniquity, will see my face no more from this day, until I shall be avenged of the race of those that came out of Egypt.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>And then will the sword of my army, and the multitude of them that serve me, pass through your sides, and you will fall among their slain, when I will return.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>And my servants will bring you back into the hill country, and will set you in one of the cities of the ascents:  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>and you will not perish, till you be destroyed with them.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>And if you hope in your heart that they will not be taken, don’t let your countenance fall.
