 Ephraim, that you have prophesied among us as today, and have said, that we should not make war with
the race of Israel, because their God will defend them? And who is God but Nebuchadnezzar?
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C6V3">&nbsp;</a>He shall send forth his might, and shall destroy them from the face of the earth, and their God shall
not deliver them: but we his servants shall strike them as one man; and they shall not sustain the might
of our horses.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C6V4">&nbsp;</a>For with them we shall burn them up, and their mountains shall be drunken with their blood, and their
plains shall be filled with their dead bodies, and their footsteps shall not stand before us, but they
shall surely perish, says king Nebuchadnezzar, lord of all the earth: for he said, The words that
<a href="#FN3"><span class="notemark">‡</span><span class="popup">Gr.
he has spoken.
</span></a>
 I have spoken shall not be in vain.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C6V5">&nbsp;</a>But you, Achior, hireling of Ammon, which have spoken these words in the day of your iniquity, shall
see my face no more from this day, until I shall be avenged of the race of those that came out of Egypt.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C6V6">&nbsp;</a>And then shall the sword of mine army, and the multitude of them that serve me, pass through your sides,
and you shall fall among their slain, when I shall return.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C6V7">&nbsp;</a>And my servants shall bring you back into the hill country, and shall set you in one of the cities of
the ascents:
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C6V8">&nbsp;</a>and you shall not perish, till you be destroyed with them.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C6V9">&nbsp;</a>And if you hope in your heart that they shall not be taken, let not your countenance fall. I have spoken
it, and none of my words shall fall to the ground.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C6V10">&nbsp;</a>And Holofernes commanded his servants, that waited in his tent, to take Achior, and bring him back to
Bethulia, and deliver him into the hands of the children of Israel.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C6V11">&nbsp;</a>And his servants took him, and brought him out of the camp into the plain, and they removed from the
midst of the plain country into the hill country, and came to the fountains that were under Bethulia.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C6V12">&nbsp;</a>And when the men of the city saw them on the top of the hill, they took up their weapons, and went out
of the city against them to the top of the hill: and every man that used a sling kept them from coming
up, and cast stones against them.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C6V13">&nbsp;</a>And they got them privily under the hill, and bound Achior, and cast him down, and left him at the foot
of the hill, and went away to their lord.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C6V14">&nbsp;</a>But the children of Israel descended from their city, and came upon him, and loosed him, and led him
away into Bethulia, and presented him to the rulers of their city;
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C6V15">&nbsp;</a>which were in those days Ozias the son of Micah, of the tribe of Simeon, and Chabris the son of Gothoniel,
and Charmis the son of Melchiel.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C6V16">&nbsp;</a>And they called together all the elders of the city; and all their young men ran together, and their
women, to the assembly; and they set Achior in the midst of all their people. And Ozias asked him of
that which had happened:
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C6V17">&nbsp;</a>and he answered and declared to them the words of the council of Holofernes, and all the words that he
had spoken in the midst of the princes of the children of Asshur, and all the great words that Holofernes
had spoken against the house of Israel.
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C6V18">&nbsp;</a>And the people fell down and worshipped God, and cried, saying,
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C6V19">&nbsp;</a>O Lord God of heaven, behold their arrogance, and pity the low estate of our race, and look upon the
face of those that are sanctified to you this day.
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C6V20">&nbsp;</a>And they comforted Achior, and praised him exceedingly.
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C6V21">&nbsp;</a>And Ozias took him out of the assembly into his house, and made a feast to the elders; and they called
on the God of Israel for help all that night.
