 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C12V1">&nbsp;</a>And Jonathan saw that the time served him, and he chose men, and sent them to Rome, to confirm and renew
the friendship that they had with them.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C12V2">&nbsp;</a>And to the Spartans, and to other places, he sent letters after the same manner.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C12V3">&nbsp;</a>And they went to Rome, and entered into the senate house, and said, Jonathan the high priest, and the
nation of the Jews, have sent us, to renew for them the friendship and the confederacy, as in former
time.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C12V4">&nbsp;</a>And they gave them letters to the men in every place, that they should bring them on their way to the
land of Judah in peace.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C12V5">&nbsp;</a>And this is the copy of the letters which Jonathan wrote to the Spartans:
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C12V6">&nbsp;</a>Jonathan the high priest, and the senate of the nation, and the priests, and the rest of the people of
the Jews, to their brethren the Spartans, greeting:
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C12V7">&nbsp;</a>Even before this time were letters sent to Onias the high priest from

</span></a>
 Arius, who was reigning among you, to signify that you⌃ are our brethren, as the copy here underwritten
shows.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C12V8">&nbsp;</a>And Onias entreated honorably the man that was sent, and received the letters, wherein declaration was
made of confederacy and friendship.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C12V9">&nbsp;</a>Therefore we also, albeit we need none of these things, having for our encouragement the holy books which
are in our hands,
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C12V10">&nbsp;</a>have assayed to send that we might renew our brotherhood and friendship with you, to the end that we
should not become estranged from you altogether: for long time is passed since you⌃ sent to us.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C12V11">&nbsp;</a>We therefore at all times without ceasing, both in our feasts, and on the other convenient days, do remember
you in the sacrifices which we offer, and in our prayers, as it is right and meet to be mindful of brethren:
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C12V12">&nbsp;</a>and moreover are glad for your glory.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C12V13">&nbsp;</a>But as for ourselves, many afflictions and many wars have encompassed us, and the kings that are round
about us have fought against us.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C12V14">&nbsp;</a>We were not minded therefore to be troublesome to you, and to the rest of our confederates and friends,
in these wars;
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C12V15">&nbsp;</a>for we have the help which is from heaven to help us, and we have been delivered from our enemies, and
our enemies have been brought low.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C12V16">&nbsp;</a>We chose therefore Numenius the son of Antiochus, and Antipater the son of Jason, and have sent them
to the Romans, to renew the friendship that we had with them, and the former confederacy.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C12V17">&nbsp;</a>We commanded them therefore to go also to you, and to salute you, and to deliver you our letters concerning
the renewing
<span class="add">of friendship
</span> and our brotherhood.
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C12V18">&nbsp;</a>And now you⌃ shall do well if you⌃ give us an answer thereto.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C12V19">&nbsp;</a>And this is the copy of the letters which they sent to Onias:

<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C12V20">&nbsp;</a>Arius king of the Spartans to Onias the chief priest, greeting:
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C12V21">&nbsp;</a>It has been found in writing, concerning the Spartans and the Jews, that they are brethren, and that
they are of the stock of Abraham:
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C12V22">&nbsp;</a>and now, since this is come to our knowledge, you⌃ shall do well to write to us of your

 prosperity.
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C12V23">&nbsp;</a>And we moreover do write on our part to you, that your cattle and goods are ours, and ours are yours.
We do command therefore that they make report to you on this wise.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C12V24">&nbsp;</a>And Jonathan heard that Demetrius’ princes were returned to fight against him with a greater host than
before,
 <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C12V25">&nbsp;</a>and he removed from Jerusalem, and met them in the country of Hamath; for he gave them no respite to
set foot in his country.
 <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C12V26">&nbsp;</a>And he sent spies into his camp, and they came again, and reported to him that they were appointed in
such and such a way to fall upon them in the night season.
 <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C12V27">&nbsp;</a>But as soon as the sun was down, Jonathan commanded his men to watch, and to be in arms, that all the
night long they might be ready for battle: and he put forth sentinels round about the camp.
 <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C12V28">&nbsp;</a>And the adversaries heard that Jonathan and his men were ready for battle, and they feared, and trembled
in their hearts, and they kindled fires in their camp
<a href="#FN3"><span class="notemark">‡</span><span class="popup">Some authorities add
and departed.
</span></a>
 <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C12V29">&nbsp;</a>But Jonathan and his men knew it not till the morning; for they saw the lights burning.
 <span class="verse"> 30</span><a name="C12V30">&nbsp;</a>And Jonathan pursued after them, and overtook them not; for they were gone over the river Eleutherus.
 <span class="verse"> 31</span><a name="C12V31">&nbsp;</a>And Jonathan turned aside to the Arabians, who are called Zabadaeans, and struck them, and took their
spoils.
 <span class="verse"> 32</span><a name="C12V32">&nbsp;</a>And he came out from thence, and came to Damascus, and took his journey through all the country.
 <span class="verse"> 33</span><a name="C12V33">&nbsp;</a>And Simon went forth, and took his journey as far as Ascalon, and the strongholds that were near to it.
And he turned aside to Joppa, and took possession of it;
 <span class="verse"> 34</span><a name="C12V34">&nbsp;</a>for he had heard that they were minded to deliver the stronghold to the men of Demetrius; and he set
a garrison there to keep it.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 35</span><a name="C12V35">&nbsp;</a>And Jonathan returned, and called the elders of the people together; and he took counsel with them to
build strongholds in Judaea,
 <span class="verse"> 36</span><a name="C12V36">&nbsp;</a>and to make the walls of Jerusalem higher, and to raise a great mound between the citadel and the city,
for to separate it from the city, that so it might be all alone, that men might neither buy nor sell.
 <span class="verse"> 37</span><a name="C12V37">&nbsp;</a>And they were gathered together to build the city, and there fell down part of the wall of the brook
that is on the east side, and he repaired that which is called Chaphenatha.
 <span class="verse"> 38</span><a name="C12V38">&nbsp;</a>And Simon also built Adida in the
<a href="#FN4"><span class="notemark">§</span><span class="popup">Gr.

</span></a>
 plain country, and made it strong, and set up gates and bars.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 39</span><a name="C12V39">&nbsp;</a>And Tryphon sought to reign over Asia and to put on himself the diadem, and to stretch forth his hand
against Antiochus the king.
 <span class="verse"> 40</span><a name="C12V40">&nbsp;</a>And he was afraid lest haply Jonathan should not suffer him, and lest he should fight against him; and
he sought a way how to take him, that he might destroy him. And he removed, and came to Bethshan.
 <span class="verse"> 41</span><a name="C12V41">&nbsp;</a>And Jonathan came forth to meet him with forty thousand men chosen for battle, and came to Bethshan.
 <span class="verse"> 42</span><a name="C12V42">&nbsp;</a>And Tryphon saw that he came with a great host, and he was afraid to stretch forth his hand against him:
 <span class="verse"> 43</span><a name="C12V43">&nbsp;</a>and he received him honorably, and commended him to all his
<a href="#FN5"><span class="notemark">**</span><span class="popup">See 1 Maccabees 2:18.
</span></a>
 Friends, and gave him gifts, and commanded his forces to be obedient to him, as to himself.
 <span class="verse"> 44</span><a name="C12V44">&nbsp;</a>And he said to Jonathan, Why have you put all this people to trouble, seeing there is no war between
us?
 <span class="verse"> 45</span><a name="C12V45">&nbsp;</a>And now send them away to their homes, but choose for yourself a few men who shall be with you, and come
you with me to Ptolemais, and I will give it up to you, and the rest of the strongholds and the rest
of the forces, and all the king’s officers: and I will return and depart; for this is the cause of my
coming.
 <span class="verse"> 46</span><a name="C12V46">&nbsp;</a>And he put his trust in him, and did even as he said, and sent away his forces, and they departed into
the land of Judah.
 <span class="verse"> 47</span><a name="C12V47">&nbsp;</a>But he reserved to himself three thousand men, of whom he left two thousand in Galilee, but one thousand
went with him.
 <span class="verse"> 48</span><a name="C12V48">&nbsp;</a>Now as soon as Jonathan entered into Ptolemais, they of Ptolemais shut the gates, and laid hands on him;
and all them that came in with him they killed with the sword.
 <span class="verse"> 49</span><a name="C12V49">&nbsp;</a>And Tryphon sent forces and horsemen into Galilee, and into the great plain, to destroy all Jonathan’s
men.
 <span class="verse"> 50</span><a name="C12V50">&nbsp;</a>And they perceived that he was taken and had perished, and they that were with him; and they encouraged
one another, and went on their way close together, prepared to fight.
 <span class="verse"> 51</span><a name="C12V51">&nbsp;</a>And they that followed upon them saw that they were ready to fight for their lives, and turned back again.
 <span class="verse"> 52</span><a name="C12V52">&nbsp;</a>And they all came in peace into the land of Judah, and they mourned for Jonathan, and them that were
with him, and they were sore afraid; and all Israel mourned with a great mourning.
 <span class="verse"> 53</span><a name="C12V53">&nbsp;</a>And all the Gentiles that were round about them sought to destroy them utterly: for they said, They have
no ruler, nor any to help them: now therefore let us fight against them, and take away their memorial
from among men.
