 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C2V1">&nbsp;</a>Yahweh’s word came to me, saying,
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C2V2">&nbsp;</a>“Go, and proclaim in the ears of Jerusalem, saying, ‘Yahweh says,
</div>
<div class="q1">“I remember for you the kindness of your youth,
</div>
<div class="q2">the love of your weddings;
</div>
<div class="q1">how you went after me in the wilderness,

<div class="q2">in a land that was not sown.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C2V3">&nbsp;</a>Israel was holiness to Yahweh,
</div>
<div class="q2">the first fruits of his increase.

<div class="q2">Evil will come on them,”’ says Yahweh.”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C2V4">&nbsp;</a>Hear Yahweh’s word, O house of Jacob, and all the families of the house of Israel!
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C2V5">&nbsp;</a>Yahweh says,
</div>
<div class="q1">“What unrighteousness have your fathers found in me,
</div>
<div class="q2">that they have gone far from me,
</div>
<div class="q1">and have walked after worthless vanity,
</div>
<div class="q2">and have become worthless?

<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C2V6">&nbsp;</a>They didn’t say, ‘Where is Yahweh who brought us up out of the land of Egypt,

</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C2V7">&nbsp;</a>I brought you into a plentiful land,

<div class="q2">and made my heritage an abomination.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C2V8">&nbsp;</a>The priests didn’t say, ‘Where is Yahweh?’
</div>
<div class="q2">and those who handle the law didn’t know me.
</div>
<div class="q1">The rulers also transgressed against me,
</div>
<div class="q2">and the prophets prophesied by Baal,
</div>
<div class="q2">and followed things that do not profit.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C2V9">&nbsp;</a>“Therefore I will yet contend with you,” says Yahweh,

<div class="q2">Be very desolate,” says Yahweh.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C2V13">&nbsp;</a>“For my people have committed two evils:
</div>
<div class="q2">they have forsaken me, the spring of living waters,

<div class="q2">and cut them out cisterns, broken cisterns, that can hold no water.

<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C2V14">&nbsp;</a>Is Israel a slave?

<div class="q2">They have made his land waste.

<div class="q2"> <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C2V16">&nbsp;</a>The children also of Memphis and Tahpanhes have broken the crown of your head.

<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C2V18">&nbsp;</a>Now what do you gain by going to Egypt, to drink the waters of the Shihor?
</div>
<div class="q2">Or why do you to go on the way to Assyria, to drink the waters of the River?<a href="#FN2"><span class="notemark">†</span><span class="popup">i.e., the Euphrates River</span></a>
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C2V19">&nbsp;</a>“Your own wickedness will correct you,
</div>
<div class="q2">and your backsliding will rebuke you.
</div>
<div class="q1">Know therefore and see that it is an evil and bitter thing,
</div>
<div class="q2">that you have forsaken Yahweh your God,
</div>
<div class="q2">and that my fear is not in you,” says the Lord, Yahweh of Armies.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C2V20">&nbsp;</a>“For long ago I broke off your yoke,
</div>
<div class="q2">and burst your bonds.
</div>
<div class="q1">You said, ‘I will not serve;’
</div>
<div class="q2">for on every high hill and under every green tree you bowed yourself,
</div>
<div class="q2">playing the prostitute.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C2V21">&nbsp;</a>Yet I had planted you a noble vine,
</div>
<div class="q2">a pure and faithful seed.
</div>
<div class="q2">How then have you turned into the degenerate branches of a foreign vine to me?
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C2V22">&nbsp;</a>For though you wash yourself with lye,
</div>
<div class="q2">and use much soap,
</div>
<div class="q2">yet your iniquity is marked before me,” says the Lord Yahweh.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C2V23">&nbsp;</a>“How can you say, ‘I am not defiled.
</div>
<div class="q2">I have not gone after the Baals’?
</div>
<div class="q1">See your way in the valley.
</div>
<div class="q2">Know what you have done.
</div>
<div class="q1">You are a swift dromedary traversing her ways;
 <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C2V24">&nbsp;</a>a wild donkey used to the wilderness, that sniffs the wind in her craving.
</div>
<div class="q2">When she is in heat, who can turn her away?
</div>
<div class="q2">All those who seek her will not weary themselves. In her month, they will find her.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C2V25">&nbsp;</a>“Keep your feet from being bare,
</div>
<div class="q2">and your throat from thirst.
</div>
<div class="q1">But you said, ‘It is in vain.
</div>
<div class="q2">No, for I have loved strangers,
</div>
<div class="q2">and I will go after them.’
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C2V26">&nbsp;</a>As the thief is ashamed when he is found,
</div>
<div class="q2">so is the house of Israel ashamed;
</div>
<div class="q2">they, their kings, their princes, and their priests, and their prophets;
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C2V27">&nbsp;</a>who tell wood, ‘You are my father;’
</div>
<div class="q2">and a stone, ‘You have given birth to me:’
</div>
<div class="q1">for they have turned their back to me,
</div>
<div class="q2">and not their face;
</div>
<div class="q2">but in the time of their trouble they will say, ‘Arise, and save us.’
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C2V28">&nbsp;</a>“But where are your gods that you have made for yourselves?
</div>
<div class="q2">Let them arise, if they can save you in the time of your trouble:
</div>
<div class="q2">for you have as many gods as you have towns, O Judah.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C2V29">&nbsp;</a>“Why will you contend with me?
</div>
<div class="q2">You all have transgressed against me,” says Yahweh.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 30</span><a name="C2V30">&nbsp;</a>“I have struck your children in vain.
</div>
<div class="q2">They received no correction.
</div>
<div class="q1">Your own sword has devoured your prophets,
</div>
<div class="q2">like a destroying lion.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 31</span><a name="C2V31">&nbsp;</a>Generation, consider Yahweh’s word.
</div>
<div class="q2">Have I been a wilderness to Israel?
</div>
<div class="q2">Or a land of thick darkness?
</div>
<div class="q1">Why do my people say, ‘We have broken loose.
</div>
<div class="q2">We will come to you no more?’
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 32</span><a name="C2V32">&nbsp;</a>“Can a virgin forget her ornaments,
</div>
<div class="q2">or a bride her attire?
</div>
<div class="q2">Yet my people have forgotten me for days without number.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 33</span><a name="C2V33">&nbsp;</a>How well you prepare your way to seek love!
</div>
<div class="q2">Therefore you have even taught the wicked women your ways.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 34</span><a name="C2V34">&nbsp;</a>Also the blood of the souls of the innocent poor is found in your skirts.
</div>
<div class="q2">You did not find them breaking in;
</div>
<div class="q2">but it is because of all these things.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 35</span><a name="C2V35">&nbsp;</a>“Yet you said, ‘I am innocent.
</div>
<div class="q2">Surely his anger has turned away from me.’
</div>
<div class="q1">“Behold, I will judge you,
</div>
<div class="q2">because you say, ‘I have not sinned.’
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 36</span><a name="C2V36">&nbsp;</a>Why do you go about so much to change your ways?
</div>
<div class="q2">You will be ashamed of Egypt also,
</div>
<div class="q2">as you were ashamed of Assyria.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 37</span><a name="C2V37">&nbsp;</a>You will also leave that place with your hands on your head;
</div>
<div class="q2">for Yahweh has rejected those in whom you trust,
</div>
<div class="q2">and you won’t prosper with them.
