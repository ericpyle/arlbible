 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C2V1">&nbsp;</a>How has the Lord covered the daughter of Zion with a cloud in his anger!
</div>
<div class="q2">He has cast down from heaven to the earth the beauty of Israel,
</div>
<div class="q2">And hasn’t remembered his footstool in the day of his anger.
</div>
<div class="b"></div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C2V2">&nbsp;</a>The Lord has swallowed up all the habitations of Jacob,
</div>
<div class="q2">and has not pitied:
</div>
<div class="q1">He has thrown down in his wrath the strongholds of the daughter of Judah;
</div>
<div class="q2">He has brought them down to the ground;
</div>
<div class="q2">he has profaned the kingdom and its princes.
</div>
<div class="b"></div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C2V3">&nbsp;</a>He has cut off in fierce anger all the horn of Israel;
</div>
<div class="q2">He has drawn back his right hand from before the enemy:
</div>
<div class="q1">He has burned up Jacob like a flaming fire,
</div>
<div class="q2">which devours all around.
</div>
<div class="b"></div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C2V4">&nbsp;</a>He has bent his bow like an enemy,
</div>
<div class="q2">he has stood with his right hand as an adversary,
</div>
<div class="q1">Has killed all that were pleasant to the eye:
</div>
<div class="q2">In the tent of the daughter of Zion he has poured out his wrath like fire.
</div>
<div class="b"></div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C2V5">&nbsp;</a>The Lord has become as an enemy,
</div>
<div class="q2">he has swallowed up Israel;
</div>
<div class="q1">He has swallowed up all her palaces,
</div>
<div class="q2">he has destroyed his strongholds;
</div>
<div class="q2">He has multiplied in the daughter of Judah mourning and lamentation.
</div>
<div class="b"></div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C2V6">&nbsp;</a>He has violently taken away his tabernacle,
</div>
<div class="q2">as if it were of a garden;
</div>
<div class="q1">he has destroyed his place of assembly:
</div>
<div class="q2">Yahweh has caused solemn assembly and Sabbath to be forgotten in Zion,
</div>
<div class="q2">Has despised in the indignation of his anger the king and the priest.
</div>
<div class="b"></div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C2V7">&nbsp;</a>The Lord has cast off his altar,
</div>
<div class="q2">he has abhorred his sanctuary;
</div>
<div class="q1">He has given up into the hand of the enemy the walls of her palaces:
</div>
<div class="q2">They have made a noise in Yahweh’s house,
</div>
<div class="q2">as in the day of a solemn assembly.
</div>
<div class="b"></div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C2V8">&nbsp;</a>Yahweh has purposed to destroy the wall of the daughter of Zion;
</div>
<div class="q2">He has stretched out the line,
</div>
<div class="q2">he has not withdrawn his hand from destroying;
</div>
<div class="q1">He has made the rampart and wall to lament;
</div>
<div class="q2">they languish together.
</div>
<div class="b"></div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C2V9">&nbsp;</a>Her gates are sunk into the ground;
</div>
<div class="q2">he has destroyed and broken her bars:
</div>
<div class="q1">Her king and her princes are among the nations where the law is not;
</div>
<div class="q2">Yes, her prophets find no vision from Yahweh.
</div>
<div class="b"></div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C2V10">&nbsp;</a>The elders of the daughter of Zion sit on the ground,
</div>
<div class="q2">they keep silence;
</div>
<div class="q1">They have cast up dust on their heads;
</div>
<div class="q2">they have clothed themselves with sackcloth:
</div>
<div class="q2">The virgins of Jerusalem hang down their heads to the ground.
</div>
<div class="b"></div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C2V11">&nbsp;</a>My eyes fail with tears,
</div>
<div class="q2">my heart is troubled;
</div>
<div class="q1">My liver is poured on the earth,
</div>
<div class="q2">because of the destruction of the daughter of my people,
</div>
<div class="q2">Because the young children and the infants swoon in the streets of the city.
</div>
<div class="b"></div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C2V12">&nbsp;</a>They ask their mothers,
</div>
<div class="q2">“Where is grain and wine?”
</div>
<div class="q2">when they swoon as the wounded in the streets of the city,
</div>
<div class="q2">when their soul is poured out into their mothers’ bosom.
</div>
<div class="b"></div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C2V13">&nbsp;</a>What shall I testify to you?
</div>
<div class="q2">what shall I liken to you, daughter of Jerusalem?
</div>
<div class="q1">What shall I compare to you,
</div>
<div class="q2">that I may comfort you, virgin daughter of Zion?
</div>
<div class="q1">For your breach is great like the sea:
</div>
<div class="q2">who can heal you?
</div>
<div class="b"></div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C2V14">&nbsp;</a>Your prophets have seen for you false and foolish visions;
</div>
<div class="q2">They have not uncovered your iniquity,
</div>
<div class="q2">to bring back your captivity,
</div>
<div class="q2">but have seen for you false revelations and causes of banishment.
</div>
<div class="b"></div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C2V15">&nbsp;</a>All that pass by clap their hands at you.
</div>
<div class="q2">They hiss and wag their head at the daughter of Jerusalem, saying,
</div>
<div class="q1">“Is this the city that men called ‘The perfection of beauty,
</div>
<div class="q2">the joy of the whole earth’?”
</div>
<div class="b"></div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C2V16">&nbsp;</a>All your enemies have opened their mouth wide against you.
</div>
<div class="q2">They hiss and gnash the teeth.
</div>
<div class="q2">They say, “We have swallowed her up.
</div>
<div class="q1">Certainly this is the day that we looked for.
</div>
<div class="q2">We have found it.
</div>
<div class="q2">We have seen it.”
</div>
<div class="b"></div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C2V17">&nbsp;</a>Yahweh has done that which he purposed;
</div>
<div class="q2">he has fulfilled his word that he commanded in the days of old;
</div>
<div class="q1">He has thrown down,
</div>
<div class="q2">and has not pitied:
</div>
<div class="q1">He has caused the enemy to rejoice over you;
</div>
<div class="q2">he has exalted the horn of your adversaries.
</div>
<div class="b"></div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C2V18">&nbsp;</a>Their heart cried to the Lord:
</div>
<div class="q2">wall of the daughter of Zion,
</div>
<div class="q2">let tears run down like a river day and night;
</div>
<div class="q1">Give yourself no respite;
</div>
<div class="q2">don’t let the apple of your eye cease.
</div>
<div class="b"></div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C2V19">&nbsp;</a>Arise, cry out in the night,
</div>
<div class="q2">at the beginning of the watches;
</div>
<div class="q1">Pour out your heart like water before the face of the Lord:
</div>
<div class="q2">Lift up your hands toward him for the life of your young children,
</div>
<div class="q2">that faint for hunger at the head of every street.
</div>
<div class="b"></div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C2V20">&nbsp;</a>“Look, Yahweh, and see to whom you have done thus!
</div>
<div class="q2">Should the women eat their offspring,
</div>
<div class="q2">the children that are dandled in the hands?
</div>
<div class="q2">Should the priest and the prophet be killed in the sanctuary of the Lord?
</div>
<div class="b"></div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C2V21">&nbsp;</a>“The youth and the old man lie on the ground in the streets.
</div>
<div class="q2">My virgins and my young men have fallen by the sword.
</div>
<div class="q1">You have killed them in the day of your anger.
</div>
<div class="q2">You have slaughtered, and not pitied.
</div>
<div class="b"></div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C2V22">&nbsp;</a>“You have called, as in the day of a solemn assembly, my terrors on every side.
</div>
<div class="q2">There was no one that escaped or remained in the day of Yahweh’s anger.
</div>
<div class="q2">My enemy has consumed those whom I have dandled and brought up.
