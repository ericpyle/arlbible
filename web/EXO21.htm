</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C21V2">&nbsp;</a>“If you buy a Hebrew servant, he shall serve six years and in the seventh he shall go out free without
paying anything.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C21V3">&nbsp;</a>If he comes in by himself, he shall go out by himself. If he is married, then his wife shall go out with
him.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C21V4">&nbsp;</a>If his master gives him a wife and she bears him sons or daughters, the wife and her children shall be
her master’s, and he shall go out by himself.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C21V5">&nbsp;</a>But if the servant shall plainly say, ‘I love my master, my wife, and my children. I will not go out
free;’
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C21V6">&nbsp;</a>then his master shall bring him to God, and shall bring him to the door or to the doorpost, and his master
shall bore his ear through with an awl, and he shall serve him for ever.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C21V7">&nbsp;</a>“If a man sells his daughter to be a female servant, she shall not go out as the male servants do.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C21V8">&nbsp;</a>If she doesn’t please her master, who has married her to himself, then he shall let her be redeemed.
He shall have no right to sell her to a foreign people, since he has dealt deceitfully with her.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C21V9">&nbsp;</a>If he marries her to his son, he shall deal with her as a daughter.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C21V10">&nbsp;</a>If he takes another wife to himself, he shall not diminish her food, her clothing, and her marital rights.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C21V11">&nbsp;</a>If he doesn’t do these three things for her, she may go free without paying any money.

 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C21V13">&nbsp;</a>but not if it is unintentional, but God allows it to happen: then I will appoint you a place where he
shall flee.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C21V14">&nbsp;</a>If a man schemes and comes presumptuously on his neighbor to kill him, you shall take him from my altar,
that he may die.
</div>

</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C21V18">&nbsp;</a>“If men quarrel and one strikes the other with a stone, or with his fist, and he doesn’t die, but is
confined to bed;
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C21V19">&nbsp;</a>if he rises again and walks around with his staff, then he who struck him shall be cleared: only he shall
pay for the loss of his time, and shall provide for his healing until he is thoroughly healed.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C21V20">&nbsp;</a>“If a man strikes his servant or his maid with a rod, and he dies under his hand, he shall surely be
punished.
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C21V21">&nbsp;</a>Notwithstanding, if he gets up after a day or two, he shall not be punished, for he is his property.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C21V22">&nbsp;</a>“If men fight and hurt a pregnant woman so that she gives birth prematurely, and yet no harm follows,
he shall be surely fined as much as the woman’s husband demands and the judges allow.
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C21V23">&nbsp;</a>But if any harm follows, then you must take life for life,
 <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C21V24">&nbsp;</a>eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot,
 <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C21V25">&nbsp;</a>burning for burning, wound for wound, and bruise for bruise.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C21V26">&nbsp;</a>“If a man strikes his servant’s eye, or his maid’s eye, and destroys it, he shall let him go free for
his eye’s sake.
 <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C21V27">&nbsp;</a>If he strikes out his male servant’s tooth, or his female servant’s tooth, he shall let him go free for
his tooth’s sake.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C21V28">&nbsp;</a>“If a bull gores a man or a woman to death, the bull shall surely be stoned, and its meat shall not be
eaten; but the owner of the bull shall not be held responsible.
 <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C21V29">&nbsp;</a>But if the bull had a habit of goring in the past, and it has been testified to its owner, and he has
not kept it in, but it has killed a man or a woman, the bull shall be stoned, and its owner shall also
be put to death.
 <span class="verse"> 30</span><a name="C21V30">&nbsp;</a>If a ransom is laid on him, then he shall give for the redemption of his life whatever is laid on him.
 <span class="verse"> 31</span><a name="C21V31">&nbsp;</a>Whether it has gored a son or has gored a daughter, according to this judgment it shall be done to him.
 <span class="verse"> 32</span><a name="C21V32">&nbsp;</a>If the bull gores a male servant or a female servant, thirty shekels<a href="#FN1"><span class="notemark">*</span><span class="popup">A shekel is about 10 grams or about 0.35 ounces, so 30 shekels is about 300 grams or about 10.6 ounces.</span></a>
 of silver shall be given to their master, and the ox shall be stoned.

<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 33</span><a name="C21V33">&nbsp;</a>“If a man opens a pit, or if a man digs a pit and doesn’t cover it, and a bull or a donkey falls into
it,
 <span class="verse"> 34</span><a name="C21V34">&nbsp;</a>the owner of the pit shall make it good. He shall give money to its owner, and the dead animal shall
be his.

<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 35</span><a name="C21V35">&nbsp;</a>“If one man’s bull injures another’s, so that it dies, then they shall sell the live bull, and divide
its price; and they shall also divide the dead animal.

in, he shall surely pay bull for bull, and the dead animal shall be his own.
