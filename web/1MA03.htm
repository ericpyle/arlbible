 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C3V1">&nbsp;</a>And his son Judas, who was called Maccabaeus, rose up in his stead.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C3V2">&nbsp;</a>And all his brethren helped him, and so did all they that clave to his father, and they fought with gladness
the battle of Israel.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C3V3">&nbsp;</a>And he got his people great glory, and put on a breastplate as a giant, and girded his warlike harness
about him, and set battles in array, protecting the army with his sword.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C3V4">&nbsp;</a>And he was like a lion in his deeds, and as a lion’s whelp roaring for prey.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C3V5">&nbsp;</a>And he pursued the lawless, seeking them out, and he burned up those that troubled his people.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C3V6">&nbsp;</a>And the lawless shrunk for fear of him, and all the workers of lawlessness were sore troubled, and salvation
prospered in his hand.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C3V7">&nbsp;</a>And he angered many kings, and made Jacob glad with his acts, and his memorial is blessed for ever.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C3V8">&nbsp;</a>And he went about among the cities of Judah, and destroyed the ungodly

</span></a>
 out of the land, and turned away wrath from Israel:
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C3V9">&nbsp;</a>and he was renowned to the utmost part of the earth, and he gathered together such as were ready to perish.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C3V10">&nbsp;</a>And Apollonius gathered the Gentiles together, and a great host from Samaria, to fight against Israel.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C3V11">&nbsp;</a>And Judas perceived it, and he went forth to meet him, and struck him, and killed him: and many fell
wounded to death, and the rest fled.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C3V12">&nbsp;</a>And they took their spoils, and Judas took the sword of Apollonius, and therewith he fought all his days.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C3V13">&nbsp;</a>And Seron, the commander of the host of Syria, heard say that Judas had gathered a gathering and a congregation
of faithful men with him, and of such as went out to war;
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C3V14">&nbsp;</a>And he said, I will make myself a name and get me glory in the kingdom; and I will fight against Judas
and them that are with him, that set at nothing the word of the king.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C3V15">&nbsp;</a>And there went up with him also a mighty army of the ungodly to help him, to take vengeance on the children
of Israel.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C3V16">&nbsp;</a>And he came near to the going up of Bethhoron, and Judas went forth to meet him with a small company.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C3V17">&nbsp;</a>But when they saw the army coming to meet them, they said to Judas, What? shall we be able, being a small
company, to fight against so great and strong a multitude? and we for our part are faint, having tasted
no food this day.
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C3V18">&nbsp;</a>And Judas said, It is an easy thing for many to be shut up in the hands of a few; and with

 heaven it is all one, to save by many or by few:
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C3V19">&nbsp;</a>for victory in battle stands not in the multitude of a host; but strength is from heaven.
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C3V20">&nbsp;</a>They come to us in fulness of insolence and lawlessness, to destroy us and our wives and our children,
for to spoil us:
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C3V21">&nbsp;</a>but we fight for our lives and our laws.
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C3V22">&nbsp;</a>And he himself will discomfit them before our face: but as for you, be you⌃ not afraid of them.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C3V23">&nbsp;</a>Now when he had left off speaking, he leapt suddenly upon them, and Seron and his army were discomfited
before him.
 <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C3V24">&nbsp;</a>And they pursued them in the going down of Bethhoron to the plain, and there fell of them about eight
hundred men; but the residue fled into the land of the Philistines.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C3V25">&nbsp;</a>And the fear of Judas and his brethren, and the dread of them, began to fall upon the nations round about
them:
 <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C3V26">&nbsp;</a>and his name came near even to the king, and every nation told of the battles of Judas.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C3V27">&nbsp;</a>But when king Antiochus heard these words, he was full of indignation: and he sent and gathered together
all the forces of his realm, an exceeding strong army.
 <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C3V28">&nbsp;</a>And he opened his treasury, and gave his forces pay for a year, and commanded them to be ready for every
need.
 <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C3V29">&nbsp;</a>And he saw that the money failed from his treasures, and that the tributes of the country were small,
because of the dissension and plague which he had brought upon the land, to the end that he might take
away the laws which had been from the first days;
 <span class="verse"> 30</span><a name="C3V30">&nbsp;</a>and he feared that he should not have enough as at other times for the charges and the gifts which he
gave aforetime with a liberal hand, and he abounded above the kings that were before him.
 <span class="verse"> 31</span><a name="C3V31">&nbsp;</a>And he was exceedingly perplexed in his mind, and he determined to go into Persia, and to take the tributes
of the countries, and to gather much money.
 <span class="verse"> 32</span><a name="C3V32">&nbsp;</a>And he left Lysias, an honorable man, and one of the seed royal, to be over the affairs of the king from
the river Euphrates to the borders of Egypt,
 <span class="verse"> 33</span><a name="C3V33">&nbsp;</a>and to bring up his son Antiochus, until he came again.
 <span class="verse"> 34</span><a name="C3V34">&nbsp;</a>And he delivered to him the half of his forces, and the elephants, and gave him charge of all the things
that he would have done, and concerning them that lived in Judaea and in Jerusalem,
 <span class="verse"> 35</span><a name="C3V35">&nbsp;</a>that he should send a host against them, to root out and destroy the strength of Israel, and the remnant
of Jerusalem, and to take away their memorial from the place;
 <span class="verse"> 36</span><a name="C3V36">&nbsp;</a>And that he should make strangers to dwell on all their coasts, and should divide their land to them
by lot.
 <span class="verse"> 37</span><a name="C3V37">&nbsp;</a>And the king took the half that remained of the forces, and removed from Antioch, from his royal city,

 the hundred and forty and seventh year; and he passed over the river Euphrates, and went through the
upper countries.

<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 38</span><a name="C3V38">&nbsp;</a>And Lysias chose Ptolemy the son of Dorymenes, and Nicanor, and Gorgias, mighty men of the king’s

</span></a>
 Friends;
 <span class="verse"> 39</span><a name="C3V39">&nbsp;</a>and with them he sent forty thousand footmen, and seven thousand horse, to go into the land of Judah,
and to destroy it, according to the word of the king.
 <span class="verse"> 40</span><a name="C3V40">&nbsp;</a>And they removed with all their host, and came and pitched near to Emmaus in the plain country.
 <span class="verse"> 41</span><a name="C3V41">&nbsp;</a>And the merchants of the country heard the fame of them, and took silver and gold exceeding much, with

them the forces of Syria and of the land of the

</span></a>
 Philistines.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 42</span><a name="C3V42">&nbsp;</a>And Judas and his brethren saw that evils were multiplied, and that the forces were encamping in their
borders; and they took knowledge of the king’s words which he had commanded, to destroy the people and
make an end of them;
 <span class="verse"> 43</span><a name="C3V43">&nbsp;</a>and they said each man to his neighbor, Let us raise up the ruin of our people, and let us fight for
our people and the holy place.
 <span class="verse"> 44</span><a name="C3V44">&nbsp;</a>And the congregation was gathered together, that they might be ready for battle, and that they might
pray, and ask for mercy and compassion.
 <span class="verse"> 45</span><a name="C3V45">&nbsp;</a>And Jerusalem was without inhabitant as a wilderness, there was none of her offspring that went in or
went out; and the sanctuary was trodden down, and the sons of strangers were in the citadel, the Gentiles
lodged therein; and joy was taken away from Jacob, and the pipe and the harp ceased.
 <span class="verse"> 46</span><a name="C3V46">&nbsp;</a>And they gathered themselves together, and came to Mizpeh, over against Jerusalem; for in Mizpeh was
there a place of prayer aforetime for Israel.
 <span class="verse"> 47</span><a name="C3V47">&nbsp;</a>And they fasted that day, and put on sackcloth, and
<span class="add">put
</span> ashes upon their heads, and tore their clothes,
 <span class="verse"> 48</span><a name="C3V48">&nbsp;</a>and laid open the book of the law, concerning which the Gentiles were wont to inquire, seeking the likenesses
of their idols.
 <span class="verse"> 49</span><a name="C3V49">&nbsp;</a>And they brought the priests’ garments, and the first fruits, and the tithes: and they stirred up the
Nazarites, who had accomplished their days.
 <span class="verse"> 50</span><a name="C3V50">&nbsp;</a>And they cried aloud toward heaven, saying, What shall we do with these men, and whither shall we carry
them away?
 <span class="verse"> 51</span><a name="C3V51">&nbsp;</a>And your holy place is trodden down and profaned, and your priests are in heaviness and brought low.
 <span class="verse"> 52</span><a name="C3V52">&nbsp;</a>And, behold, the Gentiles are assembled together against us to destroy us: you know what things they
imagine against us.
 <span class="verse"> 53</span><a name="C3V53">&nbsp;</a>How shall we be able to stand before them, except you be our help?
 <span class="verse"> 54</span><a name="C3V54">&nbsp;</a>And they sounded with the trumpets, and cried with a loud voice.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 55</span><a name="C3V55">&nbsp;</a>And after this Judas appointed leaders of the people, captains of thousands, and captains of hundreds,
and captains of fifties, and captains of tens.
 <span class="verse"> 56</span><a name="C3V56">&nbsp;</a>And he said to them that were building houses, and were betrothing wives, and were planting vineyards,
and were fearful, that they should return, each man to his own house, according to the law.
 <span class="verse"> 57</span><a name="C3V57">&nbsp;</a>And the army removed, and encamped upon the south side of Emmaus.
 <span class="verse"> 58</span><a name="C3V58">&nbsp;</a>And Judas said, Gird yourselves, and be valiant men, and be in readiness against the morning, that you⌃
may fight with these Gentiles, that are assembled together against us to destroy us, and our holy place:
 <span class="verse"> 59</span><a name="C3V59">&nbsp;</a>for it is better for us to die in battle, than to look upon the evils of our nation and the holy place.
 <span class="verse"> 60</span><a name="C3V60">&nbsp;</a>Nevertheless, as may be the will in heaven, so shall he do.
