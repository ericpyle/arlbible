 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C24V1">&nbsp;</a>When Balaam saw that it pleased Yahweh to bless Israel, he didn’t go, as at the other times, to meet
with enchantments, but he set his face toward the wilderness.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C24V2">&nbsp;</a>Balaam lifted up his eyes, and he saw Israel dwelling according to their tribes; and the Spirit of God
came on him.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C24V3">&nbsp;</a>He took up his parable, and said,
</div>
<div class="q1">“Balaam the son of Beor says,
</div>
<div class="q2">the man whose eyes are open says;
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C24V4">&nbsp;</a>he says, who hears the words of God,
</div>
<div class="q2">who sees the vision of the Almighty,
</div>
<div class="q2">falling down, and having his eyes open:
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C24V5">&nbsp;</a>How goodly are your tents, Jacob,
</div>
<div class="q2">and your tents, Israel!
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C24V6">&nbsp;</a>As valleys they are spread out,
</div>
<div class="q2">as gardens by the riverside,
</div>
<div class="q2">as aloes which Yahweh has planted,
</div>
<div class="q2">as cedar trees beside the waters.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C24V7">&nbsp;</a>Water shall flow from his buckets.
</div>
<div class="q2">His seed shall be in many waters.
</div>
<div class="q1">His king shall be higher than Agag.
</div>
<div class="q2">His kingdom shall be exalted.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C24V8">&nbsp;</a>God brings him out of Egypt.
</div>
<div class="q2">He has as it were the strength of the wild ox.
</div>
<div class="q1">He shall eat up the nations his adversaries,
</div>
<div class="q2">shall break their bones in pieces,
</div>
<div class="q2">and pierce them with his arrows.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C24V9">&nbsp;</a>He couched, he lay down as a lion,
</div>
<div class="q2">as a lioness; who shall rouse him up?
</div>
<div class="q1">Everyone who blesses you is blessed.
</div>
<div class="q2">Everyone who curses you is cursed.”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C24V10">&nbsp;</a>Balak’s anger burned against Balaam, and he struck his hands together. Balak said to Balaam, “I called
you to curse my enemies, and, behold, you have altogether blessed them these three times.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C24V11">&nbsp;</a>Therefore now flee you to your place! I thought to promote you to great honor; but, behold, Yahweh has
kept you back from honor.”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C24V12">&nbsp;</a>Balaam said to Balak, “Didn’t I also tell your messengers who you sent to me, saying,
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C24V13">&nbsp;</a>‘If Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold, I can’t go beyond Yahweh’s word, to do either
good or bad of my own mind. I will say what Yahweh says’?
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C24V14">&nbsp;</a>Now, behold, I go to my people. Come, I will inform you what this people shall do to your people in the
latter days.”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C24V15">&nbsp;</a>He took up his parable, and said,
</div>
<div class="q1">“Balaam the son of Beor says,
</div>
<div class="q2">the man whose eyes are open says;
</div>
<div class="q2"> <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C24V16">&nbsp;</a>he says, who hears the words of God,
</div>
<div class="q2">knows the knowledge of the Most High,
</div>
<div class="q2">and who sees the vision of the Almighty,
</div>
<div class="q2">Falling down, and having his eyes open:
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C24V17">&nbsp;</a>I see him, but not now.
</div>
<div class="q2">I see him, but not near.
</div>
<div class="q1">A star will come out of Jacob.
</div>
<div class="q2">A scepter will rise out of Israel,
</div>
<div class="q1">and shall strike through the corners of Moab,
</div>
<div class="q2">and break down all the sons of Sheth.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C24V18">&nbsp;</a>Edom shall be a possession.
</div>
<div class="q2">Seir, his enemies, also shall be a possession,
</div>
<div class="q2">while Israel does valiantly.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C24V19">&nbsp;</a>Out of Jacob shall one have dominion,
</div>
<div class="q2">and shall destroy the remnant from the city.”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C24V20">&nbsp;</a>He looked at Amalek, and took up his parable, and said,
</div>
<div class="q1">“Amalek was the first of the nations,
</div>
<div class="q2">But his latter end shall come to destruction.”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C24V21">&nbsp;</a>He looked at the Kenite, and took up his parable, and said,
</div>
<div class="q1">“Your dwelling place is strong.
</div>
<div class="q2">Your nest is set in the rock.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C24V22">&nbsp;</a>Nevertheless Kain shall be wasted,
</div>
<div class="q2">until Asshur carries you away captive.”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C24V23">&nbsp;</a>He took up his parable, and said,
</div>
<div class="q1">“Alas, who shall live when God does this?
</div>
<div class="q2"> <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C24V24">&nbsp;</a>But ships shall come from the coast of Kittim.
</div>
<div class="q1">They shall afflict Asshur, and shall afflict Eber.
</div>
<div class="q2">He also shall come to destruction.”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C24V25">&nbsp;</a>Balaam rose up, and went and returned to his place; and Balak also went his way.
