<div class="chapterlabel"> 2</div><div class="q1">
 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C2V1">&nbsp;</a>Blow the trumpet in Zion,
</div>
<div class="q2">and sound an alarm in my holy mountain!
</div>
<div class="q1">Let all the inhabitants of the land tremble,
</div>
<div class="q2">for the day of Yahweh comes,
</div>
<div class="q2">for it is close at hand:
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C2V2">&nbsp;</a>A day of darkness and gloominess,
</div>
<div class="q2">a day of clouds and thick darkness.
</div>
<div class="q1">As the dawn spreading on the mountains,
</div>
<div class="q2">a great and strong people;
</div>
<div class="q2">there has never been the like,
</div>
<div class="q2">neither will there be any more after them,
</div>
<div class="q2">even to the years of many generations.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C2V3">&nbsp;</a>A fire devours before them,
</div>
<div class="q2">and behind them, a flame burns.
</div>
<div class="q1">The land is as the garden of Eden before them,
</div>
<div class="q2">and behind them, a desolate wilderness.
</div>
<div class="q1">Yes, and no one has escaped them.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C2V4">&nbsp;</a>Their appearance is as the appearance of horses,
</div>
<div class="q2">and as horsemen, so do they run.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C2V5">&nbsp;</a>Like the noise of chariots on the tops of the mountains do they leap,
</div>
<div class="q2">like the noise of a flame of fire that devours the stubble,
</div>
<div class="q2">as a strong people set in battle array.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C2V6">&nbsp;</a>At their presence the peoples are in anguish.
</div>
<div class="q2">All faces have grown pale.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C2V7">&nbsp;</a>They run like mighty men.
</div>
<div class="q2">They climb the wall like warriors.
</div>
<div class="q2">They each march in his line, and they don’t swerve off course.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C2V8">&nbsp;</a>Neither does one jostle another;
</div>
<div class="q2">they march everyone in his path,
</div>
<div class="q2">and they burst through the defenses,
</div>
<div class="q2">and don’t break ranks.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C2V9">&nbsp;</a>They rush on the city.
</div>
<div class="q2">They run on the wall.
</div>
<div class="q2">They climb up into the houses.
</div>
<div class="q2">They enter in at the windows like thieves.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C2V10">&nbsp;</a>The earth quakes before them.
</div>
<div class="q2">The heavens tremble.
</div>
<div class="q2">The sun and the moon are darkened,
</div>
<div class="q2">and the stars withdraw their shining.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C2V11">&nbsp;</a>Yahweh thunders his voice before his army;
</div>
<div class="q2">for his forces are very great;
</div>
<div class="q2">for he is strong who obeys his command;
</div>
<div class="q2">for the day of Yahweh is great and very awesome,
</div>
<div class="q2">and who can endure it?
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C2V12">&nbsp;</a>“Yet even now,” says Yahweh, “turn to me with all your heart,
</div>
<div class="q2">and with fasting, and with weeping, and with mourning.”
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C2V13">&nbsp;</a>Tear your heart, and not your garments,
</div>
<div class="q2">and turn to Yahweh, your God;
</div>
<div class="q2">for he is gracious and merciful,
</div>
<div class="q2">slow to anger, and abundant in loving kindness,
</div>
<div class="q2">and relents from sending calamity.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C2V14">&nbsp;</a>Who knows? He may turn and relent,
</div>
<div class="q2">and leave a blessing behind him,
</div>
<div class="q2">even a meal offering and a drink offering to Yahweh, your God.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C2V15">&nbsp;</a>Blow the trumpet in Zion!
</div>
<div class="q2">Sanctify a fast.
</div>
<div class="q2">Call a solemn assembly.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C2V16">&nbsp;</a>Gather the people.
</div>
<div class="q2">Sanctify the assembly.
</div>
<div class="q2">Assemble the elders.
</div>
<div class="q2">Gather the children, and those who nurse from breasts.
</div>
<div class="q1">Let the bridegroom go out of his room,
</div>
<div class="q2">and the bride out of her room.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C2V17">&nbsp;</a>Let the priests, the ministers of Yahweh, weep between the porch and the altar,
</div>
<div class="q2">and let them say, “Spare your people, Yahweh,
</div>
<div class="q2">and don’t give your heritage to reproach,
</div>
<div class="q2">that the nations should rule over them.
</div>
<div class="q1">Why should they say among the peoples,
</div>
<div class="q2">‘Where is their God?’”
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C2V18">&nbsp;</a>Then Yahweh was jealous for his land,
</div>
<div class="q2">And had pity on his people.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C2V19">&nbsp;</a>Yahweh answered his people,
</div>
<div class="q2">“Behold,<a href="#FN1"><span class="notemark">*</span><span class="popup">“Behold”, from “הִנֵּה”, means look at, take notice, observe, see, or gaze at. It is often used as an
interjection.</span></a>
 I will send you grain, new wine, and oil,
</div>
<div class="q2">and you will be satisfied with them;
</div>
<div class="q2">and I will no more make you a reproach among the nations.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C2V20">&nbsp;</a>But I will remove the northern army far away from you,
</div>
<div class="q2">and will drive it into a barren and desolate land,
</div>
<div class="q2">its front into the eastern sea,
</div>
<div class="q2">and its back into the western sea;
</div>
<div class="q2">and its stench will come up,
</div>
<div class="q2">and its bad smell will rise.”
</div>
<div class="q1">Surely he has done great things.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C2V21">&nbsp;</a>Land, don’t be afraid.
</div>
<div class="q2">Be glad and rejoice, for Yahweh has done great things.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C2V22">&nbsp;</a>Don’t be afraid, you animals of the field;
</div>
<div class="q2">for the pastures of the wilderness spring up,
</div>
<div class="q2">for the tree bears its fruit.
</div>
<div class="q2">The fig tree and the vine yield their strength.
</div>
<div class="b"></div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C2V23">&nbsp;</a>“Be glad then, you children of Zion,
</div>
<div class="q2">and rejoice in Yahweh, your God;
</div>
<div class="q2">for he gives you the former rain in just measure,
</div>
<div class="q2">and he causes the rain to come down for you,
</div>
<div class="q2">the former rain and the latter rain,
</div>
<div class="q2">as before.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C2V24">&nbsp;</a>The threshing floors will be full of wheat,
</div>
<div class="q2">and the vats will overflow with new wine and oil.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C2V25">&nbsp;</a>I will restore to you the years that the swarming locust has eaten,
</div>
<div class="q2">the great locust, the grasshopper, and the caterpillar,
</div>
<div class="q2">my great army, which I sent among you.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C2V26">&nbsp;</a>You will have plenty to eat, and be satisfied,
</div>
<div class="q2">and will praise the name of Yahweh, your God,
</div>
<div class="q2">who has dealt wondrously with you;
</div>
<div class="q2">and my people will never again be disappointed.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C2V27">&nbsp;</a>You will know that I am among Israel,
</div>
<div class="q2">and that I am Yahweh, your God, and there is no one else;
</div>
<div class="q2">and my people will never again be disappointed.
</div>
<div class="b"></div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C2V28">&nbsp;</a>“It will happen afterward, that I will pour out my Spirit on all flesh;
</div>
<div class="q2">and your sons and your daughters will prophesy.
</div>
<div class="q2">Your old men will dream dreams.
</div>
<div class="q2">Your young men will see visions.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C2V29">&nbsp;</a>And also on the servants and on the handmaids in those days,
</div>
<div class="q2">I will pour out my Spirit.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 30</span><a name="C2V30">&nbsp;</a>I will show wonders in the heavens and in the earth:
</div>
<div class="q2">blood, fire, and pillars of smoke.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 31</span><a name="C2V31">&nbsp;</a>The sun will be turned into darkness,
</div>
<div class="q2">and the moon into blood,
</div>
<div class="q2">before the great and terrible day of Yahweh comes.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 32</span><a name="C2V32">&nbsp;</a>It will happen that whoever will call on Yahweh’s name shall be saved;
</div>
<div class="q2">for in Mount Zion and in Jerusalem there will be those who escape,
</div>
<div class="q2">as Yahweh has said,
</div>
<div class="q2">and among the remnant, those whom Yahweh calls.
