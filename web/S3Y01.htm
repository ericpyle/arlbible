 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C1V1">&nbsp;</a>AND they walked in the midst of the fire, praising God, and blessing the Lord.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C1V2">&nbsp;</a>Then Azarias stood, and prayed on this manner; and opening his mouth in the midst of the fire said,
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C1V3">&nbsp;</a>Blessed are you, O Lord, you God of our fathers,
<a href="#FN1"><span class="notemark">*</span><span class="popup">Another reading is,
and your name is worthy to be praised and glorified.
</span></a>
 and worthy to be praised; and your name is glorified for evermore:
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C1V4">&nbsp;</a>For you are righteous in all the things that you have done: yes, true are all your works, and your ways
are right, and all your judgements truth.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C1V5">&nbsp;</a>In all the things that you have brought upon us, and upon the holy city of our fathers,
<span class="add">even
</span> Jerusalem, you have executed true judgements: for according to truth and justice have you brought all
these things upon us because of our sins.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C1V6">&nbsp;</a>For we have sinned and committed iniquity, in departing from you.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C1V7">&nbsp;</a>In all things have we trespassed, and not obeyed your commandments, nor kept them, neither done as you
have commanded us, that it might go well with us.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C1V8">&nbsp;</a>Wherefore all that you have brought upon us, and everything that you have done to us, you have done in
true judgement.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C1V9">&nbsp;</a>And you did deliver us into the hands of lawless enemies, and most hateful forsakers
<span class="add">of God,
</span> and to an unjust king, and the most wicked in all the world.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C1V10">&nbsp;</a>And now we can’t open our mouth; shame and reproach have befallen your servants, and them that worship
you.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C1V11">&nbsp;</a>Deliver us not up utterly, for your name’s sake, neither disannul you your covenant:
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C1V12">&nbsp;</a>and cause not your mercy to depart from us, for the sake of Abraham that is beloved of you, and for the
sake of Isaac your servant, and Israel your holy one;
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C1V13">&nbsp;</a>to whom you did promise, that you would multiply their seed as the stars of heaven, and as the sand that
is upon the sea shore.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C1V14">&nbsp;</a>For we, O Lord, are become less than any nation, and be kept under this day in all the world because
of our sins.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C1V15">&nbsp;</a>Neither is there at this time prince, or prophet, or leader, or burned offering, or sacrifice, or oblation,
or incense, or place to offer before you, and to find mercy.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C1V16">&nbsp;</a>Nevertheless in a contrite heart and a humble spirit let us be accepted;
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C1V17">&nbsp;</a>like as in the burnt offerings of rams and bullocks, and like as in ten thousands of fat lambs; so let
our sacrifice be in your sight this day, and
<span class="add">grant
</span> that we may wholly go after you, for they shall not be ashamed that put their trust in you.
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C1V18">&nbsp;</a>And now we follow you with all our heart, we fear you, and seek your face. Put us not to shame: but deal
with us after your kindness, and according to the multitude of your mercy.
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C1V20">&nbsp;</a>Deliver us also according to your marvelous works, and give glory to your name, O Lord: and let all them
that do your servants hurt be confounded;

 <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C1V25">&nbsp;</a>And it spread, and burned those Chaldeans whom it found about the furnace.
 <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C1V26">&nbsp;</a>But the angel of the Lord came down into the furnace together with Azarias and his fellows, and he struck
the flame of the fire out of the furnace;
 <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C1V27">&nbsp;</a>and made the midst of the furnace as it had been a moist whistling wind, so that the fire touched them
not at all, neither hurt nor troubled them.
