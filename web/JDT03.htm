 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C3V1">&nbsp;</a>And they sent to him messengers with words of peace, saying,
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C3V2">&nbsp;</a>Behold, we the servants of Nebuchadnezzar the great king lie before you: use us as it is pleasing in
your sight.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C3V3">&nbsp;</a>Behold, our dwellings, and all our country, and all our fields of wheat, and our flocks and herds, and
all the sheepcotes of our tents, lie before your face: use them as it may please you.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C3V4">&nbsp;</a>Behold, even our cities and they that dwell in them are your servants: come and deal with them as it
is good in your eyes.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C3V5">&nbsp;</a>And the men came to Holofernes, and declared to him according to these words.

<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C3V6">&nbsp;</a>And he came down toward the sea coast, he and his host, and set garrisons in the high cities, and took
out of them chosen men for allies.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C3V7">&nbsp;</a>And they received him, they and all the country round about them, with garlands and dances and timbrels.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C3V8">&nbsp;</a>And he cast down all their borders, and cut down their groves: and it had been given to him to destroy
all the gods of the land, that all the nations should worship Nebuchadnezzar only, and that all their
tongues and their tribes should call upon him as god.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C3V9">&nbsp;</a>And he came towards Esdraelon near to Dotaea, which is over against the great ridge of Judaea.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C3V10">&nbsp;</a>And he encamped between Geba and Scythopolis, and he was there a whole month, that he might gather together
all the baggage of his host.
