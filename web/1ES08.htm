 <span class="verse"> 77</span><a name="C8V77">&nbsp;</a>And for our sins and our fathers’ we with our brethren and our kings and our priests were given up to

Jewry and Jerusalem.
 <span class="verse"> 82</span><a name="C8V82">&nbsp;</a>And now, O Lord, what shall we say, having these things? For we have transgressed your commandments,
