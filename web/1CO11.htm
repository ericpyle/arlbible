<div class="chapterlabel"> 11</div><div class="p">
 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C11V1">&nbsp;</a>Be imitators of me, even as I also am of Christ.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C11V2">&nbsp;</a>Now I praise you, brothers, that you remember me in all things, and hold firm the traditions, even as
I delivered them to you.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C11V3">&nbsp;</a>But I would have you know that the head<a href="#FN1"><span class="notemark">*</span><span class="popup">or, origin</span></a>
 of every man is Christ, and the head<a href="#FN2"><span class="notemark">†</span><span class="popup">or, origin</span></a>
 of the woman is man, and the head<a href="#FN3"><span class="notemark">‡</span><span class="popup">or, origin</span></a>
 of Christ is God.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C11V4">&nbsp;</a>Every man praying or prophesying, having his head covered, dishonors his head.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C11V5">&nbsp;</a>But every woman praying or prophesying with her head uncovered dishonors her head. For it is one and
the same thing as if she were shaved.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C11V6">&nbsp;</a>For if a woman is not covered, let her hair also be cut off. But if it is shameful for a woman to have
her hair cut off or be shaved, let her be covered.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C11V7">&nbsp;</a>For a man indeed ought not to have his head covered, because he is the image and glory of God, but the
woman is the glory of the man.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C11V8">&nbsp;</a>For man is not from woman, but woman from man;
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C11V9">&nbsp;</a>for man wasn’t created for the woman, but woman for the man.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C11V10">&nbsp;</a>For this cause the woman ought to have authority over her own head, because of the angels.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C11V11">&nbsp;</a>Nevertheless, neither is the woman independent of the man, nor the man independent of the woman, in the
Lord.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C11V12">&nbsp;</a>For as woman came from man, so a man also comes through a woman; but all things are from God.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C11V13">&nbsp;</a>Judge for yourselves. Is it appropriate that a woman pray to God unveiled?
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C11V14">&nbsp;</a>Doesn’t even nature itself teach you that if a man has long hair, it is a dishonor to him?
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C11V15">&nbsp;</a>But if a woman has long hair, it is a glory to her, for her hair is given to her for a covering.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C11V16">&nbsp;</a>But if any man seems to be contentious, we have no such custom, neither do God’s assemblies.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C11V17">&nbsp;</a>But in giving you this command, I don’t praise you, that you come together not for the better but for
the worse.
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C11V18">&nbsp;</a>For first of all, when you come together in the assembly, I hear that divisions exist among you, and
I partly believe it.
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C11V19">&nbsp;</a>For there also must be factions among you, that those who are approved may be revealed among you.
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C11V20">&nbsp;</a>When therefore you assemble yourselves together, it is not the Lord’s supper that you eat.
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C11V21">&nbsp;</a>For in your eating each one takes his own supper first. One is hungry, and another is drunken.
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C11V22">&nbsp;</a>What, don’t you have houses to eat and to drink in? Or do you despise God’s assembly, and put them to
shame who don’t have? What shall I tell you? Shall I praise you? In this I don’t praise you.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C11V23">&nbsp;</a>For I received from the Lord that which also I delivered to you, that the Lord Jesus on the night in
which he was betrayed took bread.
 <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C11V24">&nbsp;</a>When he had given thanks, he broke it, and said,
<span class="wj">“Take, eat. This is my body, which is broken for you. Do this in memory of me.”</span> <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C11V25">&nbsp;</a>In the same way he also took the cup, after supper, saying,
<span class="wj">“This cup is the new covenant in my blood. Do this, as often as you drink, in memory of me.”</span> <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C11V26">&nbsp;</a>For as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup, you proclaim the Lord’s death until he comes.
 <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C11V27">&nbsp;</a>Therefore whoever eats this bread or drinks the Lord’s cup in a way unworthy of the Lord will be guilty
of the body and the blood of the Lord.
 <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C11V28">&nbsp;</a>But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of the bread, and drink of the cup.
 <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C11V29">&nbsp;</a>For he who eats and drinks in an unworthy way eats and drinks judgment to himself, if he doesn’t discern
the Lord’s body.
 <span class="verse"> 30</span><a name="C11V30">&nbsp;</a>For this cause many among you are weak and sickly, and not a few sleep.
 <span class="verse"> 31</span><a name="C11V31">&nbsp;</a>For if we discerned ourselves, we wouldn’t be judged.
 <span class="verse"> 32</span><a name="C11V32">&nbsp;</a>But when we are judged, we are punished by the Lord, that we may not be condemned with the world.
 <span class="verse"> 33</span><a name="C11V33">&nbsp;</a>Therefore, my brothers, when you come together to eat, wait for one another.
 <span class="verse"> 34</span><a name="C11V34">&nbsp;</a>But if anyone is hungry, let him eat at home, lest your coming together be for judgment. The rest I will
set in order whenever I come.
