 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C11V1">&nbsp;</a>I ask then, did God reject his people? May it never be! For I also am an Israelite, a descendant of Abraham,
of the tribe of Benjamin.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C11V2">&nbsp;</a>God didn’t reject his people, which he foreknew. Or don’t you know what the Scripture says about Elijah?
How he pleads with God against Israel:
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C11V3">&nbsp;</a>“Lord, they have killed your prophets, they have broken down your altars; and I am left alone, and they
seek my life.”<a href="#FN1"><span class="notemark"></span><span class="popup">+ 1 Kings 19:10,14</span></a>
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C11V4">&nbsp;</a>But how does God answer him? “I have reserved for myself seven thousand men, who have not bowed the knee
to Baal.”<a href="#FN2"><span class="notemark"></span><span class="popup">+ 1 Kings 19:18</span></a>
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C11V5">&nbsp;</a>Even so then at this present time also there is a remnant according to the election of grace.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C11V6">&nbsp;</a>And if by grace, then it is no longer of works; otherwise grace is no longer grace. But if it is of works,
it is no longer grace; otherwise work is no longer work.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C11V7">&nbsp;</a>What then? That which Israel seeks for, that he didn’t obtain, but the chosen ones obtained it, and the
rest were hardened.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C11V8">&nbsp;</a>According as it is written, “God gave them a spirit of stupor, eyes that they should not see, and ears
that they should not hear, to this very day.”
<a href="#FN3"><span class="notemark"></span><span class="popup">+ Deuteronomy 29:4; Isaiah 29:10</span></a>
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C11V9">&nbsp;</a>David says,
</div>
<div class="q1">“Let their table be made a snare, and a trap,
</div>
<div class="q2">a stumbling block, and a retribution to them.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C11V10">&nbsp;</a>Let their eyes be darkened, that they may not see.
</div>
<div class="q2">Bow down their back always.”<a href="#FN4"><span class="notemark"></span><span class="popup">+ Psalm 69:22,23</span></a>
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C11V11">&nbsp;</a>I ask then, did they stumble that they might fall? May it never be! But by their fall salvation has come
to the Gentiles, to provoke them to jealousy.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C11V12">&nbsp;</a>Now if their fall is the riches of the world, and their loss the riches of the Gentiles; how much more
their fullness?
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C11V13">&nbsp;</a>For I speak to you who are Gentiles. Since then as I am an apostle to Gentiles, I glorify my ministry;
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C11V14">&nbsp;</a>if by any means I may provoke to jealousy those who are my flesh, and may save some of them.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C11V15">&nbsp;</a>For if the rejection of them is the reconciling of the world, what would their acceptance be, but life
from the dead?
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C11V16">&nbsp;</a>If the first fruit is holy, so is the lump. If the root is holy, so are the branches.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C11V17">&nbsp;</a>But if some of the branches were broken off, and you, being a wild olive, were grafted in among them,
and became partaker with them of the root and of the richness of the olive tree;
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C11V18">&nbsp;</a>don’t boast over the branches. But if you boast, it is not you who support the root, but the root supports
you.
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C11V19">&nbsp;</a>You will say then, “Branches were broken off, that I might be grafted in.”
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C11V20">&nbsp;</a>True; by their unbelief they were broken off, and you stand by your faith. Don’t be conceited, but fear;
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C11V21">&nbsp;</a>for if God didn’t spare the natural branches, neither will he spare you.
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C11V22">&nbsp;</a>See then the goodness and severity of God. Toward those who fell, severity; but toward you, goodness,
if you continue in his goodness; otherwise you also will be cut off.
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C11V23">&nbsp;</a>They also, if they don’t continue in their unbelief, will be grafted in, for God is able to graft them
in again.
 <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C11V24">&nbsp;</a>For if you were cut out of that which is by nature a wild olive tree, and were grafted contrary to nature
into a good olive tree, how much more will these, which are the natural branches, be grafted into their
own olive tree?
 <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C11V25">&nbsp;</a>For I don’t desire you to be ignorant, brothers,<a href="#FN5"><span class="notemark">*</span><span class="popup">The word for “brothers” here and where context allows may also be correctly translated “brothers and
sisters” or “siblings.”</span></a>
 of this mystery, so that you won’t be wise in your own conceits, that a partial hardening has happened
to Israel, until the fullness of the Gentiles has come in,
 <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C11V26">&nbsp;</a>and so all Israel will be saved. Even as it is written,
</div>
<div class="q1">“There will come out of Zion the Deliverer,
</div>
<div class="q2">and he will turn away ungodliness from Jacob.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C11V27">&nbsp;</a>This is my covenant to them,
</div>
<div class="q2">when I will take away their sins.”<a href="#FN6"><span class="notemark"></span><span class="popup">+ Isaiah 59:20-21; 27:9; Jeremiah 31:33-34</span></a>
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C11V28">&nbsp;</a>Concerning the Good News, they are enemies for your sake. But concerning the election, they are beloved
for the fathers’ sake.
 <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C11V29">&nbsp;</a>For the gifts and the calling of God are irrevocable.
 <span class="verse"> 30</span><a name="C11V30">&nbsp;</a>For as you in time past were disobedient to God, but now have obtained mercy by their disobedience,
 <span class="verse"> 31</span><a name="C11V31">&nbsp;</a>even so these also have now been disobedient, that by the mercy shown to you they may also obtain mercy.
 <span class="verse"> 32</span><a name="C11V32">&nbsp;</a>For God has shut up all to disobedience, that he might have mercy on all.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 33</span><a name="C11V33">&nbsp;</a>Oh the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and the knowledge of God! How unsearchable are his judgments,
and his ways past tracing out!
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 34</span><a name="C11V34">&nbsp;</a>“For who has known the mind of the Lord?

</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 36</span><a name="C11V36">&nbsp;</a>For of him, and through him, and to him, are all things. To him be the glory for ever! Amen.
