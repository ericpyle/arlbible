 by Jeremiah’s mouth might be accomplished, Yahweh stirred up the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia, so
that he made a proclamation throughout all his kingdom, and put it also in writing, saying,
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C1V2">&nbsp;</a>“Thus says Cyrus king of Persia, ‘Yahweh, the God<a href="#FN2"><span class="notemark">†</span><span class="popup">The Hebrew word rendered “God” is “אֱלֹהִ֑ים” (Elohim).</span></a>
 of heaven, has given me all the kingdoms of the earth; and he has commanded me to build him a house
in Jerusalem, which is in Judah.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C1V3">&nbsp;</a>Whoever there is among you of all his people, may his God be with him, and let him go up to Jerusalem,
which is in Judah, and build the house of Yahweh, the God of Israel (he is God), which is in Jerusalem.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C1V4">&nbsp;</a>Whoever is left, in any place where he lives, let the men of his place help him with silver, with gold,
with goods, and with animals, besides the freewill offering for God’s house which is in Jerusalem.’”

 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C1V6">&nbsp;</a>All those who were around them strengthened their hands with vessels of silver, with gold, with goods,
with animals, and with precious things, besides all that was willingly offered.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C1V7">&nbsp;</a>Also Cyrus the king brought out the vessels of Yahweh’s house, which Nebuchadnezzar had brought out of
Jerusalem, and had put in the house of his gods;

out to Sheshbazzar, the prince of Judah.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C1V9">&nbsp;</a>This is the number of them: thirty platters of gold, one thousand platters of silver, twenty-nine knives,

up when the captives were brought up from Babylon to Jerusalem.
