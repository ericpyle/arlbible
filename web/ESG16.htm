</span></a>
 The great king Artaxerxes to the governors of countries in a hundred and seven and twenty provinces
from India to Ethiopia, and to them that are well affected to our state, greeting.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C16V2">&nbsp;</a>Many, the more often they are honored with the great bounty of their benefactors, the more proud they
are waxen,
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C16V3">&nbsp;</a>and endeavor to hurt not our subjects only, but not being able to bear abundance, do take in hand to
practise also against those that do them good:
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C16V4">&nbsp;</a>and take not only thankfulness away from among men, but also lifted up with the boastful words of them
that were never good, they think to escape the evil-hating justice of God, who always sees all things.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C16V5">&nbsp;</a>Oftentimes also fair speech of those that are put in trust to manage their friends’ affairs, has caused
many that are in authority to be partakers of innocent blood, and has enwrapped them in remediless calamities:
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C16V6">&nbsp;</a>beguiling with the false deceit of their lewd disposition the innocent good will of princes.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C16V7">&nbsp;</a>Now you⌃ may see this, as we have declared, not so much by more ancient histories, as you⌃ may, if you⌃
search what has been wickedly done of late through the pestilent behavior of them that are unworthily
placed in authority.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C16V8">&nbsp;</a>And we must take care for the time to come, to render our kingdom quiet and peaceful for all men,
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C16V9">&nbsp;</a>both by changing our purposes, and always judging things that come before our eyes with more equal proceeding.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C16V10">&nbsp;</a>For Aman, a Macedonian, the son of Amadathus, an alien in truth from the Persian blood, and far distant
from our goodness, being as a guest received of us,
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C16V11">&nbsp;</a>had so far forth obtained the favor that we show toward every nation, as that he was called our father,
and was continually honored of all men, as the next person to the royal throne.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C16V12">&nbsp;</a>But he, not bearing his high estate, went about to deprive us of our kingdom and our life;
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C16V13">&nbsp;</a>having by manifold and cunning deceits sought
<span class="add">of us
</span> the destruction, as well of Mardocheus, who saved our life, and continually procured our good, as also
of Esther the blameless partaker of our kingdom, together with their whole nation.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C16V14">&nbsp;</a>For by these means he thought, finding us destitute
<span class="add">of friends</span>, to have translated the kingdom of the Persians to the Macedonians.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C16V15">&nbsp;</a>But we find that the Jews, whom this most ungracious wretch has delivered to utter destruction, are no
evil-doers, but live by most just laws:
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C16V16">&nbsp;</a>and that they be children of the most high and most mighty living God, who has ordered the kingdom both
to us and to our progenitors in the most excellent manner.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C16V17">&nbsp;</a>Wherefore you⌃ shall do well not to put in execution the letters sent to you by Aman the son of Amadathus.
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C16V18">&nbsp;</a>For he, that was the worker of these things, is hanged at the gates of Susa with all his family: God,
who rules all things, speedily rendering vengeance to him according to his deserts.
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C16V19">&nbsp;</a>Therefore you⌃ shall publish openly the copy of this letter in all places, and let the Jews live after
their own laws,
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C16V20">&nbsp;</a>and you⌃ shall aid them, that even the same day, being the thirteenth day of the twelfth month Adar,
they may defend themselves against those who set upon them in the time of their affliction.
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C16V21">&nbsp;</a>For Almighty God has made this day to be a joy to them, instead of the destruction of the chosen people.
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C16V22">&nbsp;</a>And you⌃ shall therefore among your commemorative feasts keep it a high day with all feasting:
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C16V23">&nbsp;</a>that both now and hereafter there may be safety to us, and the well affected Persians; but to those which
do conspire against us a memorial of destruction.
 <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C16V24">&nbsp;</a>Therefore every city or country whatever, which shall not do according to these things, shall be utterly
destroyed without mercy with
<a href="#FN2"><span class="notemark">†</span><span class="popup">Gr.
spear and fire.
</span></a>
 fire and sword; it shall be made not only unpassable for men, but also most hateful to wild beasts and
fowls for ever.
