 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C4V1">&nbsp;</a>In that day Tobit remembered concerning the money which he had left in trust with Gabael in Rages of
Media,
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C4V2">&nbsp;</a>and he said in himself, I have asked for death; why do I not call my son Tobias, that I may show to him
<span class="add">of the money
</span> before I die?
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C4V3">&nbsp;</a>And he called him, and said,
</div>
<div class="p">My child,
<a href="#FN1"><span class="notemark">*</span><span class="popup">Gr.
if.
</span></a>
 when I die, bury me: and despise not your mother; honor her all the days of your life, and do that which
is pleasing to her, and grieve her not.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C4V4">&nbsp;</a>Remember, my child, that she has seen many dangers for you,
<span class="add">when you were
</span> in her womb. When she is dead, bury her by me in one grave.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C4V5">&nbsp;</a>My child, be mindful of the Lord our God all your days, and let not your will be set to sin and to transgress
his commandments: do righteousness all the days of your life, and follow not the ways of unrighteousness.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C4V6">&nbsp;</a>For if you do the truth, your doings shall prosperously succeed to you, and to all them that do righteousness.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C4V7">&nbsp;</a>Give alms of your substance; and when you give alms, let not your eye be envious: turn not away your
face from any poor man, and the face of God shall not be turned away from you.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C4V8">&nbsp;</a>As your substance is, give alms of it according to your abundance: if you have little, be not afraid
to give alms according to that little:
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C4V9">&nbsp;</a>for you lay up a good treasure for yourself against the day of necessity:
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C4V10">&nbsp;</a>because alms delivers from death, and suffers not to come into darkness.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C4V11">&nbsp;</a>Alms is a good gift in the sight of the Most High for all that give it.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C4V12">&nbsp;</a>Beware, my child, of all whoredom, and take first a wife of the seed of your fathers, and take not a
strange wife, which is not of your father’s tribe: for we are the sons of the prophets. Noah, Abraham,
Isaac, Jacob, our fathers of old time, remember, my child, that they all took wives of their brethren,
and were blessed in their children, and their seed shall inherit the land.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C4V13">&nbsp;</a>And now, my child, love your brethren, and scorn not in your heart your brethren, and the sons and the
daughters of your people, to take a wife of them: for in scornfulness is destruction and much trouble,
and in naughtiness is decay and great lack: for naughtiness is the mother of famine.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C4V14">&nbsp;</a>Let not the wages of any man, which shall work for you, wait with you, but render it to him out of hand:
and if you serve God, recompense shall be made to you. Take heed to yourself, my child, in all your works,
and be discreet in all your behavior.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C4V15">&nbsp;</a>And what you yourself hate, do to no man. Drink not wine to drunkenness, and let not drunkenness go with
you on your way.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C4V16">&nbsp;</a>Give of your bread to the hungry, and of your garments to them that are naked: of all your abundance
give alms; and let not your eye be envious when you give alms.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C4V17">&nbsp;</a>Pour out your bread on the
<a href="#FN2"><span class="notemark">†</span><span class="popup">Or,
tomb
</span></a>
 burial of the just, and give nothing to sinners.
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C4V18">&nbsp;</a>Ask counsel of every man that is wise, and despise not any counsel that is profitable.
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C4V19">&nbsp;</a>And bless the Lord your God at all times, and ask of him that your ways may be made straight, and that
all your paths and counsels may prosper: for every nation has not counsel; but the Lord himself gives
all good things, and he humbles whom he will, as he will. And now, my child, remember my commandments,
and let them not be blotted out of your mind.
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C4V20">&nbsp;</a>And now I show you of the ten talents of silver, which I left in trust with Gabael the son of Gabrias
at Rages of Media.
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C4V21">&nbsp;</a>And fear not, my child, because we are made poor: you have much wealth, if you fear God, and depart from
all sin, and do that which is pleasing in his sight.
