 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C10V1">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">“Most certainly, I tell you, one who doesn’t enter by the door into the sheep fold, but climbs up some
other way, the same is a thief and a robber.
</span> <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C10V2">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">But one who enters in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep.
</span> <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C10V3">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">The gatekeeper opens the gate for him, and the sheep listen to his voice. He calls his own sheep by name,
and leads them out.
</span> <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C10V4">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Whenever he brings out his own sheep, he goes before them, and the sheep follow him, for they know his
voice.
</span> <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C10V5">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">They will by no means follow a stranger, but will flee from him; for they don’t know the voice of strangers.”</span> <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C10V6">&nbsp;</a>Jesus spoke this parable to them, but they didn’t understand what he was telling them.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C10V7">&nbsp;</a>Jesus therefore said to them again,
<span class="wj">“Most certainly, I tell you, I am the sheep’s door.
</span> <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C10V8">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">All who came before me are thieves and robbers, but the sheep didn’t listen to them.
</span> <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C10V9">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">I am the door. If anyone enters in by me, he will be saved, and will go in and go out, and will find
pasture.
</span> <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C10V10">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">The thief only comes to steal, kill, and destroy. I came that they may have life, and may have it abundantly.
</span> <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C10V11">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">I am the good shepherd.</span><a href="#FN1"><span class="notemark"></span><span class="popup">+ Isaiah 40:11; Ezekiel 34:11-12,15,22</span></a>
<span class="wj">The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep.
</span> <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C10V12">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">He who is a hired hand, and not a shepherd, who doesn’t own the sheep, sees the wolf coming, leaves the
sheep, and flees. The wolf snatches the sheep, and scatters them.
</span> <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C10V13">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">The hired hand flees because he is a hired hand, and doesn’t care for the sheep.
</span> <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C10V14">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">I am the good shepherd. I know my own, and I’m known by my own;
</span> <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C10V15">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">even as the Father knows me, and I know the Father. I lay down my life for the sheep.
</span> <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C10V16">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">I have other sheep, which are not of this fold.</span><a href="#FN2"><span class="notemark"></span><span class="popup">+ Isaiah 56:8
</span></a>
<span class="wj">I must bring them also, and they will hear my voice. They will become one flock with one shepherd.
</span> <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C10V17">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Therefore the Father loves me, because I lay down my life,
</span><a href="#FN3"><span class="notemark"></span><span class="popup">+ Isaiah 53:7-8</span></a>
<span class="wj">that I may take it again.
</span> <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C10V18">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">No one takes it away from me, but I lay it down by myself. I have power to lay it down, and I have power
to take it again. I received this commandment from my Father.”</span></div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C10V19">&nbsp;</a>Therefore a division arose again among the Jews because of these words.
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C10V20">&nbsp;</a>Many of them said, “He has a demon, and is insane! Why do you listen to him?”
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C10V21">&nbsp;</a>Others said, “These are not the sayings of one possessed by a demon. It isn’t possible for a demon to
open the eyes of the blind, is it?”<a href="#FN4"><span class="notemark"></span><span class="popup">+ Exodus 4:11</span></a>

<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C10V22">&nbsp;</a>It was the Feast of the Dedication<a href="#FN5"><span class="notemark">*</span><span class="popup">The “Feast of the Dedication” is the Greek name for “Hanukkah”, a celebration of the rededication of

 at Jerusalem.
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C10V23">&nbsp;</a>It was winter, and Jesus was walking in the temple, in Solomon’s porch.
 <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C10V24">&nbsp;</a>The Jews therefore came around him and said to him, “How long will you hold us in suspense? If you are
the Christ, tell us plainly.”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C10V25">&nbsp;</a>Jesus answered them,
<span class="wj">“I told you, and you don’t believe. The works that I do in my Father’s name, these testify about me.
</span> <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C10V26">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">But you don’t believe, because you are not of my sheep, as I told you.
</span> <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C10V27">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me.
</span> <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C10V28">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">I give eternal life to them. They will never perish, and no one will snatch them out of my hand.
</span> <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C10V29">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">My Father, who has given them to me, is greater than all. No one is able to snatch them out of my Father’s
hand.
</span> <span class="verse"> 30</span><a name="C10V30">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">I and the Father are one.”</span></div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 31</span><a name="C10V31">&nbsp;</a>Therefore Jews took up stones again to stone him.
 <span class="verse"> 32</span><a name="C10V32">&nbsp;</a>Jesus answered them,
<span class="wj">“I have shown you many good works from my Father. For which of those works do you stone me?”</span></div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 33</span><a name="C10V33">&nbsp;</a>The Jews answered him, “We don’t stone you for a good work, but for blasphemy: because you, being a man,
make yourself God.”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 34</span><a name="C10V34">&nbsp;</a>Jesus answered them,
<span class="wj">“Isn’t it written in your law, ‘I said, you are gods?’</span><a href="#FN6"><span class="notemark"></span><span class="popup">+ Psalm 82:6</span></a>
 <span class="verse"> 35</span><a name="C10V35">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">If he called them gods, to whom the word of God came (and the Scripture can’t be broken),
</span> <span class="verse"> 36</span><a name="C10V36">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">do you say of him whom the Father sanctified and sent into the world, ‘You blaspheme,’ because I said,
‘I am the Son of God?’
</span> <span class="verse"> 37</span><a name="C10V37">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">If I don’t do the works of my Father, don’t believe me.
</span> <span class="verse"> 38</span><a name="C10V38">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">But if I do them, though you don’t believe me, believe the works; that you may know and believe that
the Father is in me, and I in the Father.”
</span></div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 39</span><a name="C10V39">&nbsp;</a>They sought again to seize him, and he went out of their hand.
 <span class="verse"> 40</span><a name="C10V40">&nbsp;</a>He went away again beyond the Jordan into the place where John was baptizing at first, and there he stayed.
 <span class="verse"> 41</span><a name="C10V41">&nbsp;</a>Many came to him. They said, “John indeed did no sign, but everything that John said about this man is
true.”
 <span class="verse"> 42</span><a name="C10V42">&nbsp;</a>Many believed in him there.
