 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C5V1">&nbsp;</a>Now about this time Antiochus made his second inroad into Egypt.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C5V2">&nbsp;</a>And it
<span class="add">so
</span> befell that throughout all the city, for the space of almost forty days, there appeared in the midst
of the sky horsemen in swift motion, wearing robes inwrought with gold and
<span class="add">carrying
</span> spears, equipped in troops for battle;
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C5V3">&nbsp;</a>and drawing of swords; and
<span class="add">on the other side
</span> squadrons of horse in array; and encounters and
<a href="#FN1"><span class="notemark">*</span><span class="popup">Or,

</span></a>
 pursuits of both
<span class="add">armies;
</span> and shaking of shields, and multitudes of lances, and casting of darts, and flashing of golden trappings,
and girding on of all sorts of armor.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C5V4">&nbsp;</a>Wherefore all men implored that the

</span></a>
 vision might have been given for good.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C5V5">&nbsp;</a>But when a false rumour had arisen that Antiochus was deceased, Jason took not less than a thousand men,
and suddenly

</span></a>
 made an assault upon the city; and they that were upon the wall being routed, and the city being now
at length well near taken, Menelaus took refuge in the citadel.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C5V6">&nbsp;</a>But Jason slaughtered his own citizens without mercy, not considering that good success against kinsmen
is the greatest ill success, but supposing himself to be setting up trophies over enemies, and not over
fellow-countrymen.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C5V7">&nbsp;</a>The office
<span class="add">however
</span> he did not get, but, receiving shame as the end of his conspiracy, he passed again a fugitive into the
country of the Ammonites.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C5V8">&nbsp;</a>At the last therefore he met with a miserable end: having been

</span></a>
 shut up at the court of Aretas the prince of the Arabians, fleeing from city to city, pursued of all
men, hated as an apostate from the laws, and held in abomination as the butcher of his country and his
fellow-citizens, he was cast forth into Egypt;
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C5V9">&nbsp;</a>and he that had driven many from their own country into strange lands perished
<span class="add">himself
</span> in a strange land, having crossed the sea to the Lacedaemonians, as thinking to find shelter
<span class="add">there
</span> because they were

</span></a>
 near of kin;
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C5V10">&nbsp;</a>and he that had cast out a multitude unburied had none to mourn for him, nor had he any funeral at all,
or place in the sepulchre of his fathers.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C5V11">&nbsp;</a>Now when tidings came to the king concerning that which was done, he thought that Judaea was in revolt;
whereupon setting out from Egypt in a furious mind, he took the city by force of arms,
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C5V12">&nbsp;</a>and commanded his soldiers to cut down without mercy such as came in their way, and to kill such as went
up upon the houses;
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C5V13">&nbsp;</a>and there was killing of young and old, making away of boys, women, and children, slaying of virgins
and infants.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C5V14">&nbsp;</a>And in all the three days
<span class="add">of the slaughter
</span> there were destroyed fourscore thousand,
<span class="add">whereof
</span> forty thousand
<span class="add">were slain
</span> in close combat, and no fewer were sold than slain.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C5V15">&nbsp;</a>But not content with this he presumed to enter into the most holy temple of all the earth, having Menelaus
for his guide (him that had proved himself a traitor both to the laws and to his country),
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C5V16">&nbsp;</a>even taking the sacred vessels with his polluted hands, and dragging down with his profane hands the
offerings that had been dedicated by other kings to the augmentation and glory and honor of the place.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C5V17">&nbsp;</a>And Antiochus was lifted up in mind, not seeing that because of the sins of them that lived in the city
the Sovereign Lord had been provoked to anger a little while, and therefore his eye was
<span class="add">then
</span> turned away from the place.
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C5V18">&nbsp;</a>But had it not so been that they were already holden by many sins, this man, even as Heliodorus who was
sent by Seleucus the king to view the treasury, would, so soon as he pressed forward, have been scourged
and turned back from his daring deed.
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C5V19">&nbsp;</a>Howbeit the Lord did not choose the nation for the place’s sake, but the place for the nation’s sake.
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C5V20">&nbsp;</a>Wherefore also the place itself, having partaken in the calamities that befell the nation, did afterward
share in
<span class="add">its
</span> benefits; and the
<span class="add">place
</span> which was forsaken in the wrath of the Almighty was, at the reconciliation of the great Sovereign, restored
again with all glory.
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C5V21">&nbsp;</a>As for Antiochus, when he had carried away out of the temple a thousand and eight hundred talents, he
departed in all haste to Antioch, weening in his arrogancy to make the land navigable and the sea passable
by foot, because his heart was lifted up.
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C5V22">&nbsp;</a>And moreover he left governors to afflict the race: at Jerusalem, Philip, by race a Phrygian, and in
character more barbarous than him that set him there;
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C5V23">&nbsp;</a>and at Gerizim, Andronicus; and besides these, Menelaus, who worse than all the rest exalted himself
against his fellow-citizens. And having a malicious mind

that were of full age, and to sell the women and the younger men.
 <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C5V25">&nbsp;</a>And he coming to Jerusalem, and playing the man of peace, waited till the holy day of the Sabbath, and
finding the Jews at rest from work, he commanded his men to parade in arms.
 <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C5V26">&nbsp;</a>And he put to the sword all them that came forth to the spectacle; and running into the city with the
armed men he killed great multitudes.
