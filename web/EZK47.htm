 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C47V1">&nbsp;</a>He brought me back to the door of the house; and behold, waters issued out from under the threshold of
the house eastward; (for the forefront of the house was toward the east;) and the waters came down from
under, from the right side of the house, on the south of the altar.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C47V2">&nbsp;</a>Then he brought me out by the way of the gate northward, and led me round by the way outside to the outer
gate, by the way of the gate that looks toward the east; and behold, there ran out waters on the right
side.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C47V3">&nbsp;</a>When the man went out eastward with the line in his hand, he measured one thousand cubits,<a href="#FN1"><span class="notemark">*</span><span class="popup">A cubit is the length from the tip of the middle finger to the elbow on a man’s arm, or about 18 inches
or 46 centimeters.</span></a>
 and he caused me to pass through the waters, waters that were to the ankles.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C47V4">&nbsp;</a>Again he measured one thousand, and caused me to pass through the waters, waters that were to the knees.
Again he measured one thousand, and caused me to pass through waters that were to the waist.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C47V5">&nbsp;</a>Afterward he measured one thousand; and it was a river that I could not pass through; for the waters
were risen, waters to swim in, a river that could not be passed through.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C47V6">&nbsp;</a>He said to me, “Son of man, have you seen?”
</div>
<div class="p">Then he brought me, and caused me to return to the bank of the river.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C47V7">&nbsp;</a>Now when I had returned, behold, on the bank of the river were very many trees on the one side and on
the other.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C47V8">&nbsp;</a>Then he said to me, “These waters flow out toward the eastern region, and will go down into the Arabah;
and they will go toward the sea; and flow into the sea which will be made to flow out; and the waters
will be healed.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C47V9">&nbsp;</a>It will happen, that every living creature which swarms, in every place where the rivers come, will live;
and there will be a very great multitude of fish; for these waters have come there, and the waters of
the sea will be healed, and everything will live wherever the river comes.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C47V10">&nbsp;</a>It will happen, that fishermen will stand by it. From En Gedi even to En Eglaim will be a place for the
spreading of nets. Their fish will be after their kinds, as the fish of the great sea, exceedingly many.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C47V11">&nbsp;</a>But the miry places of it, and its marshes, will not be healed. They will be given up to salt.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C47V12">&nbsp;</a>By the river on its bank, on this side and on that side, will grow every tree for food, whose leaf won’t
wither, neither will its fruit fail. It will produce new fruit every month, because its waters issue
out of the sanctuary. Its fruit will be for food, and its leaf for healing.”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C47V13">&nbsp;</a>Thus says the Lord Yahweh: “This shall be the border, by which you shall divide the land for inheritance
according to the twelve tribes of Israel. Joseph shall have two portions.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C47V14">&nbsp;</a>You shall inherit it, one as well as another; for I swore to give it to your fathers: and this land will
fall to you for inheritance.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C47V15">&nbsp;</a>“This shall be the border of the land:
</div>
<div class="p">“On the north side, from the great sea, by the way of Hethlon, to the entrance of Zedad;
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C47V16">&nbsp;</a>Hamath, Berothah, Sibraim, which is between the border of Damascus and the border of Hamath; Hazer Hatticon,
which is by the border of Hauran.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C47V17">&nbsp;</a>The border from the sea, shall be Hazar Enon at the border of Damascus; and on the north northward is
the border of Hamath. This is the north side.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C47V18">&nbsp;</a>“The east side, between Hauran and Damascus and Gilead, and the land of Israel, shall be the Jordan;
from the north border to the east sea you shall measure. This is the east side.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C47V19">&nbsp;</a>“The south side southward shall be from Tamar as far as the waters of Meriboth Kadesh, to the brook,
to the great sea. This is the south side southward.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C47V20">&nbsp;</a>“The west side shall be the great sea, from the south border as far as over against the entrance of Hamath.
This is the west side.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C47V21">&nbsp;</a>“So you shall divide this land to you according to the tribes of Israel.
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C47V22">&nbsp;</a>It will happen, that you shall divide it by lot for an inheritance to you and to the aliens who live
among you, who will father children among you; and they shall be to you as the native-born among the
children of Israel; they shall have inheritance with you among the tribes of Israel.
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C47V23">&nbsp;</a>It shall happen, that in whatever tribe the stranger lives, there you shall give him his inheritance,”
says the Lord Yahweh.
