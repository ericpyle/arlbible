 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C2V1">&nbsp;</a>Hannah prayed, and said:
</div>
<div class="q1">“My heart exults in Yahweh!
</div>
<div class="q2">My horn is exalted in Yahweh.
</div>
<div class="q1">My mouth is enlarged over my enemies,

<div class="q2">because I rejoice in your salvation.
</div>
<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C2V2">&nbsp;</a>There is no one as holy as Yahweh,

<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C2V3">&nbsp;</a>“Don’t keep talking so exceedingly proudly.

<div class="q2">Don’t let arrogance come out of your mouth,

 and brings up.

<div class="q1"> <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C2V7">&nbsp;</a>Yahweh makes poor, and makes rich.

<div class="q2">He brings low, he also lifts up.

<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C2V11">&nbsp;</a>Elkanah went to Ramah to his house. The child served Yahweh before Eli the priest.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C2V12">&nbsp;</a>Now the sons of Eli were wicked men. They didn’t know Yahweh.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C2V13">&nbsp;</a>The custom of the priests with the people was that when anyone offered a sacrifice, the priest’s servant
came while the meat was boiling, with a fork of three teeth in his hand;
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C2V14">&nbsp;</a>and he stabbed it into the pan, or kettle, or cauldron, or pot. The priest took all that the fork brought
up for himself. So they did in Shiloh to all the Israelites who came there.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C2V15">&nbsp;</a>Yes, before they burned the fat, the priest’s servant came, and said to the man who sacrificed, “Give
meat to roast for the priest; for he will not accept boiled meat from you, but raw.”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C2V16">&nbsp;</a>If the man said to him, “Let the fat be burned first, and then take as much as your soul desires”; then
he would say, “No, but you shall give it to me now; and if not, I will take it by force.”
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C2V17">&nbsp;</a>The sin of the young men was very great before Yahweh; for the men despised the offering of Yahweh.
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C2V18">&nbsp;</a>But Samuel ministered before Yahweh, being a child, clothed with a linen ephod.
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C2V19">&nbsp;</a>Moreover his mother made him a little robe, and brought it to him from year to year, when she came up
with her husband to offer the yearly sacrifice.
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C2V20">&nbsp;</a>Eli blessed Elkanah and his wife, and said, “May Yahweh give you offspring<a href="#FN2"><span class="notemark">†</span><span class="popup">or, seed</span></a>
 from this woman for the petition which was asked of Yahweh.” Then they went to their own home.
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C2V21">&nbsp;</a>Yahweh visited Hannah, and she conceived, and bore three sons and two daughters. The child Samuel grew
before Yahweh.
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C2V22">&nbsp;</a>Now Eli was very old; and he heard all that his sons did to all Israel, and how that they slept with
the women who served at the door of the Tent of Meeting.
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C2V23">&nbsp;</a>He said to them, “Why do you do such things? for I hear of your evil dealings from all this people.
 <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C2V24">&nbsp;</a>No, my sons; for it is no good report that I hear! You make Yahweh’s people disobey.
 <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C2V25">&nbsp;</a>If one man sins against another, God will judge him; but if a man sins against Yahweh, who will intercede
for him?” Notwithstanding, they didn’t listen to the voice of their father, because Yahweh intended to
kill them.
 <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C2V26">&nbsp;</a>The child Samuel grew on, and increased in favor both with Yahweh, and also with men.
 <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C2V27">&nbsp;</a>A man of God came to Eli, and said to him, “Yahweh says, ‘Did I reveal myself to the house of your father,
when they were in Egypt in bondage to Pharaoh’s house?
 <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C2V28">&nbsp;</a>Didn’t I choose him out of all the tribes of Israel to be my priest, to go up to my altar, to burn incense,
to wear an ephod before me? Didn’t I give to the house of your father all the offerings of the children
of Israel made by fire?
 <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C2V29">&nbsp;</a>Why do you<a href="#FN3"><span class="notemark">‡</span><span class="popup">plural</span></a>
 kick at my sacrifice and at my offering, which I have commanded in my habitation, and honor your sons
above me, to make yourselves fat with the best of all the offerings of Israel my people?’
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 30</span><a name="C2V30">&nbsp;</a>“Therefore Yahweh, the God of Israel, says, ‘I said indeed that your house, and the house of your father,
should walk before me forever.’ But now Yahweh says, ‘Far be it from me; for those who honor me I will
honor, and those who despise me will be lightly esteemed.
 <span class="verse"> 31</span><a name="C2V31">&nbsp;</a>Behold,<a href="#FN4"><span class="notemark">§</span><span class="popup">“Behold”, from “הִנֵּה”, means look at, take notice, observe, see, or gaze at. It is often used as an
interjection.</span></a>
 the days come, that I will cut off your arm, and the arm of your father’s house, that there will not
be an old man in your house.
 <span class="verse"> 32</span><a name="C2V32">&nbsp;</a>You will see the affliction of my habitation, in all the wealth which I will give Israel; and there shall
not be an old man in your house forever.
 <span class="verse"> 33</span><a name="C2V33">&nbsp;</a>The man of yours, whom I don’t cut off from my altar, will consume your eyes<a href="#FN5"><span class="notemark">**</span><span class="popup">or, blind your eyes with tears</span></a>
 and grieve your heart; and all the increase of your house will die in the flower of their age.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 34</span><a name="C2V34">&nbsp;</a>“‘This will be the sign to you, that will come on your two sons, on Hophni and Phinehas: in one day they
will both die.
 <span class="verse"> 35</span><a name="C2V35">&nbsp;</a>I will raise me up a faithful priest, that will do according to that which is in my heart and in my mind.
I will build him a sure house; and he will walk before my anointed forever.
 <span class="verse"> 36</span><a name="C2V36">&nbsp;</a>It will happen, that everyone who is left in your house will come and bow down to him for a piece of
silver and a loaf of bread, and will say, “Please put me into one of the priests’ offices, that I may
eat a morsel of bread.”’”
