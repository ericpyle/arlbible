 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C25V1">&nbsp;</a>Moreover, David and the captains of the army set apart for the service certain of the sons of Asaph,
and of Heman, and of Jeduthun, who were to prophesy with harps, with stringed instruments, and with cymbals.
The number of those who did the work according to their service was:
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C25V2">&nbsp;</a>of the sons of Asaph: Zaccur, Joseph, Nethaniah, and Asharelah. The sons of Asaph were under the hand
of Asaph, who prophesied at the order of the king.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C25V3">&nbsp;</a>Of Jeduthun; the sons of Jeduthun: Gedaliah, Zeri, Jeshaiah, Shimei, Hashabiah, and Mattithiah, six,
under the hands of their father Jeduthun, who prophesied in giving thanks and praising Yahweh with the
harp.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C25V4">&nbsp;</a>Of Heman; the sons of Heman: Bukkiah, Mattaniah, Uzziel, Shebuel, Jerimoth, Hananiah, Hanani, Eliathah,
Giddalti, Romamti-Ezer, Joshbekashah, Mallothi, Hothir, and Mahazioth.
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C25V5">&nbsp;</a>All these were the sons of Heman the king’s seer in the words of God, to lift up the horn. God gave to
Heman fourteen sons and three daughters.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C25V6">&nbsp;</a>All these were under the hands of their father for song in Yahweh’s house, with cymbals, stringed instruments,
and harps, for the service of God’s house; Asaph, Jeduthun, and Heman being under the order of the king.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C25V7">&nbsp;</a>The number of them, with their brothers who were instructed in singing to Yahweh, even all who were skillful,
was two hundred eighty-eight.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C25V8">&nbsp;</a>They cast lots for their offices, all alike, the small as well as the great, the teacher as well as the
student.
