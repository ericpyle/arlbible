 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C14V1">&nbsp;</a>Now after a space of three years tidings were brought to Judas and his company that Demetrius the
<span class="add">son
</span> of Seleucus, having sailed into the haven of Tripolis with a mighty host and a fleet,
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C14V2">&nbsp;</a>had gotten possession of the country, having made away with Antiochus and Lysias his guardian.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C14V3">&nbsp;</a>But one Alcimus, who had formerly been high priest, and had wilfully polluted himself in the times when
there was no mingling
<span class="add">with the Gentiles,
</span> considering that there was no deliverance for him in any way, nor any more access to the holy altar,
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C14V4">&nbsp;</a>came to king Demetrius in about the hundred and one and fifties year, presenting to him a chaplet of
gold and a palm, and beside these
<span class="add">some
</span> of the festal olive boughs of the temple. And for that day he held his peace;
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C14V5">&nbsp;</a>but having gotten opportunity to further his own madness, being called by Demetrius into a meeting of
his council, and asked how the Jews stood affected and what they purposed, he answered thereto.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C14V6">&nbsp;</a>Those of the Jews that he called

 Hasidaeans, whose leader is Judas Maccabaeus, keep up war, and are seditious, not suffering the kingdom

 hither;
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C14V8">&nbsp;</a>first for the unfeigned care I have for the things that concern the king, and secondly because I have
regard also to mine own fellow-citizens: for, through the unadvised dealing of those of whom I spoke
before, our whole race is in no small misfortune.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C14V9">&nbsp;</a>But do you, O king, having informed yourself of these things severally, take thought both for our country
and for our race, which
<a href="#FN3"><span class="notemark">‡</span><span class="popup">Or,

</span></a>
 is surrounded
<span class="add">by foes,
</span> according to the gracious kindness with which you receive all.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C14V10">&nbsp;</a>For as long as Judas remains alive, it is impossible that the state should find peace.

 Friends, having ill will against Judas, inflamed Demetrius yet more.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C14V12">&nbsp;</a>And forthwith appointing Nicanor, who had been master of the elephants, and making him governor of Judaea,
he sent him forth,
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C14V13">&nbsp;</a>giving him written instructions to make away with Judas himself and to scatter them that were with him,
and to set up Alcimus as high priest of the

<span class="add">upon their heads
</span> and made solemn supplication to him who had established his own people for evermore, and who always,
making manifest his presence, upholdeth
<span class="add">them that are
</span> his own portion.

 And when the leader had given
<span class="add">his

<span class="add">called

 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C14V17">&nbsp;</a>But Simon, the brother of Judas, had encountered Nicanor,

 yet not till late, having received a check by reason of the sudden consternation caused by his adversaries.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C14V18">&nbsp;</a>Nevertheless Nicanor, hearing of the manliness of them that were with Judas, and their courage in fighting
for their country, shrank from bringing the matter to the decision of the sword.
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C14V19">&nbsp;</a>Wherefore he sent Posidonius and Theodotus and Mattathias to give and receive pledges of friendship.
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C14V20">&nbsp;</a>So when these proposals had been long considered, and the leader had made the

 troops acquainted therewith, and it appeared that they were all of like mind, they consented to the
covenants.
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C14V21">&nbsp;</a>And they appointed a day on which to meet together by themselves. And a litter was borne forward from
each
<span class="add">army;
</span> they set chairs of state;
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C14V22">&nbsp;</a>Judas stationed armed men ready in convenient places, lest haply there should suddenly be treachery on
the part of the enemy; they held such conference as was meet.
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C14V23">&nbsp;</a>Nicanor tarried in Jerusalem, and did nothing to cause disturbance, but dismissed the flocks of people
that had gathered together.
 <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C14V24">&nbsp;</a>And he kept Judas always in his presence; he had gained a hearty affection for the man;
 <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C14V25">&nbsp;</a>he urged him to marry and beget children; he married, settled quietly, took part in common life.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C14V26">&nbsp;</a>But Alcimus, perceiving the good will that was between them,

and the covenants that had been made, took occasion and came
</span></a>
 and having got possession of the covenants that had been made, came to Demetrius and told him that Nicanor
was ill affected toward the state, for he had appointed that conspirator against his kingdom, Judas,
to be his successor.
 <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C14V27">&nbsp;</a>And the king, falling into a rage, and being exasperated by the calumnnies of that most wicked man, wrote
to Nicanor, signifying that he was displeased at the covenants, and commanding him to send Maccabaeus
prisoner to Antioch in all haste.
 <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C14V28">&nbsp;</a>And when this message came to Nicanor, he was confounded, and was sore troubled at the thought of annulling
the articles that had been agreed upon, the man having done no wrong;
 <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C14V29">&nbsp;</a>but because there was no dealing against the king, he watched his time to execute this purpose by stratagem.
 <span class="verse"> 30</span><a name="C14V30">&nbsp;</a>But Maccabaeus, when he perceived that Nicanor was behaving more harshly in his dealings with him, and
that he had become ruler in his customary bearing, understanding that this harshness came not of good,
gathered together not a few of his men, and concealed himself from Nicanor.

 <span class="verse"> 33</span><a name="C14V33">&nbsp;</a>he stretched forth his right hand toward the sanctuary, and sware this oath: If you⌃ will not deliver

 <span class="verse"> 34</span><a name="C14V34">&nbsp;</a>And having said this, he departed. But the priests, stretching forth their hands toward heaven, called
upon him that ever fights for our nation, in these words:

</span></a>

<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 37</span><a name="C14V37">&nbsp;</a>Now information was given to Nicanor against one Razis, an elder of Jerusalem,

 as being a lover of his countrymen and a man of very good report, and one called Father of the Jews
for his good will
<span class="add">toward them.
</span> <span class="verse"> 38</span><a name="C14V38">&nbsp;</a>For in the former times when there was no mingling
<span class="add">with the Gentiles
</span> he had been accused of
<span class="add">cleaving to
</span> the Jews’ religion, and had jeoparded body and life with all earnestness for the religion of the Jews.
 <span class="verse"> 39</span><a name="C14V39">&nbsp;</a>And Nicanor, wishing to make evident the ill will that he bare to the Jews, sent above five hundred soldiers
to take him;

 troops were on the point of taking the tower, and were forcing the door of the court, and bade bring
fire and burn the doors, he being surrounded on every side fell upon his sword,
 <span class="verse"> 42</span><a name="C14V42">&nbsp;</a>choosing rather to die nobly than to fall into the hands of the wicked wretches, and suffer outrage unworthy
of his own nobleness:
 <span class="verse"> 43</span><a name="C14V43">&nbsp;</a>but since he missed his stroke through the excitement of the struggle, and the crowds were now rushing
within the door, he ran bravely up to the wall and cast himself down manfully among the crowds.
 <span class="verse"> 44</span><a name="C14V44">&nbsp;</a>But as they quickly gave back, a space was made, and he fell on the middle of
