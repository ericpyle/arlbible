 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C20V1">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">“For the Kingdom of Heaven is like a man who was the master of a household, who went out early in the
morning to hire laborers for his vineyard.
</span> <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C20V2">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">When he had agreed with the laborers for a denarius</span><a href="#FN1"><span class="notemark">*</span><span class="popup">A denarius is a silver Roman coin worth 1/25th of a Roman aureus. This was a common wage for a day of
farm labor.</span></a>
<span class="wj">a day, he sent them into his vineyard.
</span> <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C20V3">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">He went out about the third hour,</span><a href="#FN2"><span class="notemark">†</span><span class="popup">Time was measured from sunrise to sunset, so the third hour would be about 9:00 a.m.</span></a>
<span class="wj">and saw others standing idle in the marketplace.
</span> <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C20V4">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">He said to them, ‘You also go into the vineyard, and whatever is right I will give you.’ So they went
their way.
</span> <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C20V5">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Again he went out about the sixth and the ninth hour,</span><a href="#FN3"><span class="notemark">‡</span><span class="popup">noon and 3:00 p.m.</span></a>
<span class="wj">and did likewise.
</span> <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C20V6">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">About the eleventh hour</span><a href="#FN4"><span class="notemark">§</span><span class="popup">5:00 p.m.</span></a>
<span class="wj">he went out, and found others standing idle. He said to them, ‘Why do you stand here all day idle?’
</span></div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C20V7">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">“They said to him, ‘Because no one has hired us.’</span></div>
<div class="p"><span class="wj">“He said to them, ‘You also go into the vineyard, and you will receive whatever is right.’
</span> <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C20V8">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">When evening had come, the lord of the vineyard said to his manager, ‘Call the laborers and pay them
their wages, beginning from the last to the first.’</span></div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C20V9">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">“When those who were hired at about the eleventh hour came, they each received a denarius.
</span> <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C20V10">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">When the first came, they supposed that they would receive more; and they likewise each received a denarius.
</span> <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C20V11">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">When they received it, they murmured against the master of the household,
</span> <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C20V12">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">saying, ‘These last have spent one hour, and you have made them equal to us, who have borne the burden
of the day and the scorching heat!’
</span></div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C20V13">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">“But he answered one of them, ‘Friend, I am doing you no wrong. Didn’t you agree with me for a denarius?
</span> <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C20V14">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Take that which is yours, and go your way. It is my desire to give to this last just as much as to you.
</span> <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C20V15">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Isn’t it lawful for me to do what I want to with what I own? Or is your eye evil, because I am good?’
</span> <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C20V16">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">So the last will be first, and the first last. For many are called, but few are chosen.”</span></div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C20V17">&nbsp;</a>As Jesus was going up to Jerusalem, he took the twelve disciples aside, and on the way he said to them,
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C20V18">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">“Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem, and the Son of Man will be delivered to the chief priests and
scribes, and they will condemn him to death,
</span> <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C20V19">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">and will hand him over to the Gentiles to mock, to scourge, and to crucify; and the third day he will
be raised up.”</span></div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C20V20">&nbsp;</a>Then the mother of the sons of Zebedee came to him with her sons, kneeling and asking a certain thing
of him.
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C20V21">&nbsp;</a>He said to her,
<span class="wj">“What do you want?”</span></div>
<div class="p">She said to him, “Command that these, my two sons, may sit, one on your right hand, and one on your left
hand, in your Kingdom.”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C20V22">&nbsp;</a>But Jesus answered,
<span class="wj">“You don’t know what you are asking. Are you able to drink the cup that I am about to drink, and be baptized
with the baptism that I am baptized with?”</span></div>
<div class="p">They said to him, “We are able.”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C20V23">&nbsp;</a>He said to them,
<span class="wj">“You will indeed drink my cup, and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with, but to sit on
my right hand and on my left hand is not mine to give; but it is for whom it has been prepared by my
Father.”</span></div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C20V24">&nbsp;</a>When the ten heard it, they were indignant with the two brothers.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C20V25">&nbsp;</a>But Jesus summoned them, and said,
<span class="wj">“You know that the rulers of the nations lord it over them, and their great ones exercise authority over
them.
</span> <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C20V26">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">It shall not be so among you, but whoever desires to become great among you shall be</span><a href="#FN5"><span class="notemark">**</span><span class="popup">TR reads “let him be” instead of “shall be”
</span></a>
<span class="wj">your servant.
</span> <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C20V27">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Whoever desires to be first among you shall be your bondservant,
</span> <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C20V28">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">even as the Son of Man came not to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many.”</span></div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C20V29">&nbsp;</a>As they went out from Jericho, a great multitude followed him.
 <span class="verse"> 30</span><a name="C20V30">&nbsp;</a>Behold, two blind men sitting by the road, when they heard that Jesus was passing by, cried out, “Lord,
have mercy on us, you son of David!”
 <span class="verse"> 31</span><a name="C20V31">&nbsp;</a>The multitude rebuked them, telling them that they should be quiet, but they cried out even more, “Lord,
have mercy on us, you son of David!”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 32</span><a name="C20V32">&nbsp;</a>Jesus stood still, and called them, and asked,
<span class="wj">“What do you want me to do for you?”</span></div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 33</span><a name="C20V33">&nbsp;</a>They told him, “Lord, that our eyes may be opened.”
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 34</span><a name="C20V34">&nbsp;</a>Jesus, being moved with compassion, touched their eyes; and immediately their eyes received their sight,
and they followed him.
