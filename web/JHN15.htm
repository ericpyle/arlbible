</span> <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C15V2">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Every branch in me that doesn’t bear fruit, he takes away. Every branch that bears fruit, he prunes,
that it may bear more fruit.
</span> <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C15V3">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">You are already pruned clean because of the word which I have spoken to you.
</span> <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C15V4">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Remain in me, and I in you. As the branch can’t bear fruit by itself, unless it remains in the vine,
so neither can you, unless you remain in me.
</span> <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C15V5">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">I am the vine. You are the branches. He who remains in me, and I in him, the same bears much fruit, for
apart from me you can do nothing.
</span> <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C15V6">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">If a man doesn’t remain in me, he is thrown out as a branch, and is withered; and they gather them, throw
them into the fire, and they are burned.
</span> <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C15V7">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">If you remain in me, and my words remain in you, you will ask whatever you desire, and it will be done
for you.</span></div>

</span> <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C15V9">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Even as the Father has loved me, I also have loved you. Remain in my love.
</span> <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C15V10">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">If you keep my commandments, you will remain in my love; even as I have kept my Father’s commandments,
and remain in his love.
</span> <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C15V11">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">I have spoken these things to you, that my joy may remain in you, and that your joy may be made full.</span></div>

</span> <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C15V15">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">No longer do I call you servants, for the servant doesn’t know what his lord does. But I have called
you friends, for everything that I heard from my Father, I have made known to you.
</span> <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C15V16">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">You didn’t choose me, but I chose you, and appointed you, that you should go and bear fruit, and that
your fruit should remain; that whatever you will ask of the Father in my name, he may give it to you.</span></div>

</span> <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C15V19">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">If you were of the world, the world would love its own. But because you are not of the world, since I
chose you out of the world, therefore the world hates you.
</span> <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C15V20">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">Remember the word that I said to you: ‘A servant is not greater than his lord.’</span><a href="#FN1"><span class="notemark"></span><span class="popup">+ John 13:16</span></a>

sin.

</span> <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C15V24">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">If I hadn’t done among them the works which no one else did, they wouldn’t have had sin. But now have
they seen and also hated both me and my Father.
</span> <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C15V25">&nbsp;</a><span class="wj">But this happened so that the word may be fulfilled which was written in their law, ‘They hated me without
