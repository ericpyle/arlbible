<div class="chapterlabel"> 12</div><div class="p">
 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C12V1">&nbsp;</a>Now concerning spiritual things, brothers, I don’t want you to be ignorant.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C12V2">&nbsp;</a>You know that when you were heathen,<a href="#FN1"><span class="notemark">*</span><span class="popup">or Gentiles</span></a>
 you were led away to those mute idols, however you might be led.
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C12V3">&nbsp;</a>Therefore I make known to you that no man speaking by God’s Spirit says, “Jesus is accursed.” No one
can say, “Jesus is Lord,” but by the Holy Spirit.
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C12V4">&nbsp;</a>Now there are various kinds of gifts, but the same Spirit.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C12V5">&nbsp;</a>There are various kinds of service, and the same Lord.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C12V6">&nbsp;</a>There are various kinds of workings, but the same God, who works all things in all.
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C12V7">&nbsp;</a>But to each one is given the manifestation of the Spirit for the profit of all.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C12V8">&nbsp;</a>For to one is given through the Spirit the word of wisdom, and to another the word of knowledge, according
to the same Spirit;
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C12V9">&nbsp;</a>to another faith, by the same Spirit; and to another gifts of healings, by the same Spirit;
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C12V10">&nbsp;</a>and to another workings of miracles; and to another prophecy; and to another discerning of spirits; to
another different kinds of languages; and to another the interpretation of languages.
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C12V11">&nbsp;</a>But the one and the same Spirit produces all of these, distributing to each one separately as he desires.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C12V12">&nbsp;</a>For as the body is one, and has many members, and all the members of the body, being many, are one body;
so also is Christ.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C12V13">&nbsp;</a>For in one Spirit we were all baptized into one body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether bond or free; and
were all given to drink into one Spirit.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C12V14">&nbsp;</a>For the body is not one member, but many.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C12V15">&nbsp;</a>If the foot would say, “Because I’m not the hand, I’m not part of the body,” it is not therefore not
part of the body.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C12V16">&nbsp;</a>If the ear would say, “Because I’m not the eye, I’m not part of the body,” it’s not therefore not part
of the body.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C12V17">&nbsp;</a>If the whole body were an eye, where would the hearing be? If the whole were hearing, where would the
smelling be?
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C12V18">&nbsp;</a>But now God has set the members, each one of them, in the body, just as he desired.
 <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C12V19">&nbsp;</a>If they were all one member, where would the body be?
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C12V20">&nbsp;</a>But now they are many members, but one body.
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C12V21">&nbsp;</a>The eye can’t tell the hand, “I have no need for you,” or again the head to the feet, “I have no need
for you.”
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C12V22">&nbsp;</a>No, much rather, those members of the body which seem to be weaker are necessary.
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C12V23">&nbsp;</a>Those parts of the body which we think to be less honorable, on those we bestow more abundant honor;
and our unpresentable parts have more abundant propriety;
 <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C12V24">&nbsp;</a>whereas our presentable parts have no such need. But God composed the body together, giving more abundant
honor to the inferior part,
 <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C12V25">&nbsp;</a>that there should be no division in the body, but that the members should have the same care for one
another.
 <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C12V26">&nbsp;</a>When one member suffers, all the members suffer with it. Or when one member is honored, all the members
rejoice with it.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C12V27">&nbsp;</a>Now you are the body of Christ, and members individually.
 <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C12V28">&nbsp;</a>God has set some in the assembly: first apostles, second prophets, third teachers, then miracle workers,
then gifts of healings, helps, governments, and various kinds of languages.
 <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C12V29">&nbsp;</a>Are all apostles? Are all prophets? Are all teachers? Are all miracle workers?
 <span class="verse"> 30</span><a name="C12V30">&nbsp;</a>Do all have gifts of healings? Do all speak with various languages? Do all interpret?
 <span class="verse"> 31</span><a name="C12V31">&nbsp;</a>But earnestly desire the best gifts. Moreover, I show a most excellent way to you.
