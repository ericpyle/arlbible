 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C3V1">&nbsp;</a>But know this, that in the last days, grievous times will come.
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C3V2">&nbsp;</a>For men will be lovers of self, lovers of money, boastful, arrogant, blasphemers, disobedient to parents,
unthankful, unholy,
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C3V3">&nbsp;</a>without natural affection, unforgiving, slanderers, without self-control, fierce, not lovers of good,
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C3V4">&nbsp;</a>traitors, headstrong, conceited, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God;
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C3V5">&nbsp;</a>holding a form of godliness, but having denied its power. Turn away from these, also.
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C3V6">&nbsp;</a>For some of these are people who creep into houses, and take captive gullible women loaded down with
sins, led away by various lusts,
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C3V7">&nbsp;</a>always learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C3V8">&nbsp;</a>Even as Jannes and Jambres opposed Moses, so do these also oppose the truth; men corrupted in mind, who
concerning the faith, are rejected.
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C3V9">&nbsp;</a>But they will proceed no further. For their folly will be evident to all men, as theirs also came to
be.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C3V10">&nbsp;</a>But you did follow my teaching, conduct, purpose, faith, patience, love, steadfastness,
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C3V11">&nbsp;</a>persecutions, and sufferings: those things that happened to me at Antioch, Iconium, and Lystra. I endured
those persecutions. The Lord delivered me out of them all.
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C3V12">&nbsp;</a>Yes, and all who desire to live godly in Christ Jesus will suffer persecution.
 <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C3V13">&nbsp;</a>But evil men and impostors will grow worse and worse, deceiving and being deceived.
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C3V14">&nbsp;</a>But you remain in the things which you have learned and have been assured of, knowing from whom you have
learned them.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C3V15">&nbsp;</a>From infancy, you have known the holy Scriptures which are able to make you wise for salvation through
faith, which is in Christ Jesus.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C3V16">&nbsp;</a>Every Scripture is God-breathed and<a href="#FN1"><span class="notemark">*</span><span class="popup">or, Every writing inspired by God is</span></a>
 profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for instruction in righteousness,
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C3V17">&nbsp;</a>that the man of God may be complete, thoroughly equipped for every good work.
