<div class="chapterlabel"> 3</div><div class="p">
 <span class="verse"> 1</span><a name="C3V1">&nbsp;</a>Foolish Galatians, who has bewitched you not to obey the truth, before whose eyes Jesus Christ was openly
portrayed among you as crucified?
 <span class="verse"> 2</span><a name="C3V2">&nbsp;</a>I just want to learn this from you: Did you receive the Spirit by the works of the law, or by hearing
of faith?
 <span class="verse"> 3</span><a name="C3V3">&nbsp;</a>Are you so foolish? Having begun in the Spirit, are you now completed in the flesh?
 <span class="verse"> 4</span><a name="C3V4">&nbsp;</a>Did you suffer so many things in vain, if it is indeed in vain?
 <span class="verse"> 5</span><a name="C3V5">&nbsp;</a>He therefore who supplies the Spirit to you, and does miracles among you, does he do it by the works
of the law, or by hearing of faith?
 <span class="verse"> 6</span><a name="C3V6">&nbsp;</a>Even as Abraham “believed God, and it was counted to him for righteousness.”
 <span class="verse"> 7</span><a name="C3V7">&nbsp;</a>Know therefore that those who are of faith, the same are children of Abraham.
 <span class="verse"> 8</span><a name="C3V8">&nbsp;</a>The Scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles by faith, preached the Good News beforehand
to Abraham, saying, “In you all the nations will be blessed.”<a href="#FN1"><span class="notemark"></span><span class="popup">+ Genesis 12:3; 18:18; 22:18</span></a>
 <span class="verse"> 9</span><a name="C3V9">&nbsp;</a>So then, those who are of faith are blessed with the faithful Abraham.
 <span class="verse"> 10</span><a name="C3V10">&nbsp;</a>For as many as are of the works of the law are under a curse. For it is written, “Cursed is everyone
who doesn’t continue in all things that are written in the book of the law, to do them.”<a href="#FN2"><span class="notemark"></span><span class="popup">+ Deuteronomy 27:26</span></a>
 <span class="verse"> 11</span><a name="C3V11">&nbsp;</a>Now that no man is justified by the law before God is evident, for, “The righteous will live by faith.”<a href="#FN3"><span class="notemark"></span><span class="popup">+ Habakkuk 2:4</span></a>
 <span class="verse"> 12</span><a name="C3V12">&nbsp;</a>The law is not of faith, but, “The man who does them will live by them.”<a href="#FN4"><span class="notemark"></span><span class="popup">+ Leviticus 18:5</span></a>
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 13</span><a name="C3V13">&nbsp;</a>Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law, having become a curse for us. For it is written, “Cursed
is everyone who hangs on a tree,”<a href="#FN5"><span class="notemark"></span><span class="popup">+ Deuteronomy 21:23</span></a>
 <span class="verse"> 14</span><a name="C3V14">&nbsp;</a>that the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Christ Jesus; that we might receive the
promise of the Spirit through faith.
 <span class="verse"> 15</span><a name="C3V15">&nbsp;</a>Brothers, speaking of human terms, though it is only a man’s covenant, yet when it has been confirmed,
no one makes it void, or adds to it.
 <span class="verse"> 16</span><a name="C3V16">&nbsp;</a>Now the promises were spoken to Abraham and to his offspring.<a href="#FN6"><span class="notemark">*</span><span class="popup">or, seed</span></a>
 He doesn’t say, “To descendants<a href="#FN7"><span class="notemark">†</span><span class="popup">or, seeds</span></a>
”, as of many, but as of one, “To your offspring<a href="#FN8"><span class="notemark">‡</span><span class="popup">or, seed</span></a>
”,<a href="#FN9"><span class="notemark"></span><span class="popup">+ Genesis 12:7; 13:15; 24:7</span></a>
 which is Christ.
 <span class="verse"> 17</span><a name="C3V17">&nbsp;</a>Now I say this. A covenant confirmed beforehand by God in Christ, the law, which came four hundred thirty
years after, does not annul, so as to make the promise of no effect.
 <span class="verse"> 18</span><a name="C3V18">&nbsp;</a>For if the inheritance is of the law, it is no more of promise; but God has granted it to Abraham by
promise.
</div>
<div class="p"> <span class="verse"> 19</span><a name="C3V19">&nbsp;</a>What then is the law? It was added because of transgressions, until the offspring<a href="#FN10"><span class="notemark">§</span><span class="popup">or, seed</span></a>
 should come to whom the promise has been made. It was ordained through angels by the hand of a mediator.
 <span class="verse"> 20</span><a name="C3V20">&nbsp;</a>Now a mediator is not between one, but God is one.
 <span class="verse"> 21</span><a name="C3V21">&nbsp;</a>Is the law then against the promises of God? Certainly not! For if there had been a law given which could
make alive, most certainly righteousness would have been of the law.
 <span class="verse"> 22</span><a name="C3V22">&nbsp;</a>But the Scriptures imprisoned all things under sin, that the promise by faith in Jesus Christ might be
given to those who believe.
 <span class="verse"> 23</span><a name="C3V23">&nbsp;</a>But before faith came, we were kept in custody under the law, confined for the faith which should afterwards
be revealed.
 <span class="verse"> 24</span><a name="C3V24">&nbsp;</a>So that the law has become our tutor to bring us to Christ, that we might be justified by faith.
 <span class="verse"> 25</span><a name="C3V25">&nbsp;</a>But now that faith has come, we are no longer under a tutor.
 <span class="verse"> 26</span><a name="C3V26">&nbsp;</a>For you are all children of God, through faith in Christ Jesus.
 <span class="verse"> 27</span><a name="C3V27">&nbsp;</a>For as many of you as were baptized into Christ have put on Christ.
 <span class="verse"> 28</span><a name="C3V28">&nbsp;</a>There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free man, there is neither male nor female;
for you are all one in Christ Jesus.
 <span class="verse"> 29</span><a name="C3V29">&nbsp;</a>If you are Christ’s, then you are Abraham’s offspring<a href="#FN11"><span class="notemark">**</span><span class="popup">or, seed</span></a>
 and heirs according to promise.
