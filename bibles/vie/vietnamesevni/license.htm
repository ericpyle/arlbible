The HTML Bible is simple HTML code, and operates only under your browser.  It cannot 
 create files, or perform other functions that could conceivably damage a computer.  But,
 because there are people who use lawsuits to prevent the spread of the gospel of Jesus
 Christ, the following "fine print" has been added to protect those that distribute the
 HTML Bible.
