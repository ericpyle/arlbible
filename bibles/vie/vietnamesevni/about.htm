Most Bibles viewed on the Internet are created by a Common Gateways Interface (CGI) program, and are not
 very portable.  A web server and must be installed to get them to run.  
<P>
The HTML Bible consists of 1,189 "flat" HTML Web pages.  It does not require a web server, and can operate on almost any platform.
 All that is required is to have a Computer and a Browser, such as Netscape or Internet Explorer.  The HTML
 Bible can function as a collection of files located in a folder on your hard drive.

<P>The HTML Bible was created by using Visual Basic 5.0 to convert  and load public domain Bible texts to
 an Access 97 database, where another VB program checked the data for accuracy.  A third program then
 converted the data from Access to 1,189 chapter text files and an index file with .htm extensions, with
 the appropriate HTML tags inserted for presenting the data in a table format. 
 The VB program wrote the hyperlinks between each adjoining chapter and to and from the index page.
 Hyperlinks between related verses concerning the same topic in the KJV 2.0 and 3.0 
 have been manually installed.

<P>To increase access speed, each chapter of the Bible is presented as one HTML file. There are 1,189 chapter-files in the Internet Bible, plus an index, license, and About file. The chapter filenames are arranged as follows:</P>

<TABLE border=0 cellpadding=5><TR><TD><FONT FACE="OldCentury" SIZE=4 COLOR="#000000">

</TD><TD><FONT FACE="OldCentury" SIZE=3 COLOR="#000000">
