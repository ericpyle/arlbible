 <span class="verse" id="V1">1&nbsp;</span>And it came to pass after this, that Absalom prepared him chariots and horses, and fifty men to run before him.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span>And Absalom rose up early, and stood beside the way of the gate: and it was so, that when any man that had a controversy came to the king for judgment, then Absalom called unto him, and said, Of what city <span class='add'>art</span> thou? And he said, Thy servant is of one of the tribes of Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>And Absalom said unto him, See, thy matters <span class='add'>are</span> good and right; but <span class='add'>there is</span> no man <span class='add'>deputed</span> of the king to hear thee.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>Absalom said moreover, Oh that I were made judge in the land, that every man which hath any suit or cause might come unto me, and I would do him justice!  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>And it was <span class='add'>so</span>, that when any man came nigh <span class='add'>to him</span> to do him obeisance, he put forth his hand, and took him, and kissed him.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>And on this manner did Absalom to all Israel that came to the king for judgment: so Absalom stole the hearts of the men of Israel. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>And it came to pass after forty years, that Absalom said unto the king, I pray thee, let me go and pay my vow, which I have vowed unto the LORD, in Hebron.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>For thy servant vowed a vow while I abode at Geshur in Syria, saying, If the LORD shall bring me again indeed to Jerusalem, then I will serve the LORD.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>And the king said unto him, Go in peace. So he arose, and went to Hebron. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>But Absalom sent spies throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, As soon as ye hear the sound of the trumpet, then ye shall say, Absalom reigneth in Hebron.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>And with Absalom went two hundred men out of Jerusalem, <span class='add'>that were</span> called; and they went in their simplicity, and they knew not any thing.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>And Absalom sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite, David’s counsellor, from his city, <span class='add'>even</span> from Giloh, while he offered sacrifices. And the conspiracy was strong; for the people increased continually with Absalom. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>And there came a messenger to David, saying, The hearts of the men of Israel are after Absalom.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>And David said unto all his servants that <span class='add'>were</span> with him at Jerusalem, Arise, and let us flee; for we shall not <span class='add'>else</span> escape from Absalom: make speed to depart, lest he overtake us suddenly, and bring evil upon us, and smite the city with the edge of the sword.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>And the king’s servants said unto the king, Behold, thy servants <span class='add'>are ready to do</span> whatsoever my lord the king shall appoint.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>And the king went forth, and all his household after him. And the king left ten women, <span class='add'>which were</span> concubines, to keep the house.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>And the king went forth, and all the people after him, and tarried in a place that was far off.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>And all his servants passed on beside him; and all the Cherethites, and all the Pelethites, and all the Gittites, six hundred men which came after him from Gath, passed on before the king. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>Then said the king to Ittai the Gittite, Wherefore goest thou also with us? return to thy place, and abide with the king: for thou <span class='add'>art</span> a stranger, and also an exile.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>Whereas thou camest <span class='add'>but</span> yesterday, should I this day make thee go up and down with us? seeing I go whither I may, return thou, and take back thy brethren: mercy and truth <span class='add'>be</span> with thee.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>And Ittai answered the king, and said, <span class='add'>As</span> the LORD liveth, and <span class='add'>as</span> my lord the king liveth, surely in what place my lord the king shall be, whether in death or life, even there also will thy servant be.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>And David said to Ittai, Go and pass over. And Ittai the Gittite passed over, and all his men, and all the little ones that <span class='add'>were</span> with him.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>And all the country wept with a loud voice, and all the people passed over: the king also himself passed over the brook Kidron, and all the people passed over, toward the way of the wilderness. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>And lo Zadok also, and all the Levites <span class='add'>were</span> with him, bearing the ark of the covenant of God: and they set down the ark of God; and Abiathar went up, until all the people had done passing out of the city.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>And the king said unto Zadok, Carry back the ark of God into the city: if I shall find favour in the eyes of the LORD, he will bring me again, and shew me <span class='add'>both</span> it, and his habitation:  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>But if he thus say, I have no delight in thee; behold, <span class='add'>here am</span> I, let him do to me as seemeth good unto him.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>The king said also unto Zadok the priest, <span class='add'>Art not</span> thou a seer? return into the city in peace, and your two sons with you, Ahimaaz thy son, and Jonathan the son of Abiathar.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&nbsp;</span>See, I will tarry in the plain of the wilderness, until there come word from you to certify me.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&nbsp;</span>Zadok therefore and Abiathar carried the ark of God again to Jerusalem: and they tarried there. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V30">30&nbsp;</span>And David went up by the ascent of <span class='add'>mount</span> Olivet, and wept as he went up, and had his head covered, and he went barefoot: and all the people that <span class='add'>was</span> with him covered every man his head, and they went up, weeping as they went up. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V31">31&nbsp;</span>And <span class='add'>one</span> told David, saying, Ahithophel <span class='add'>is</span> among the conspirators with Absalom. And David said, O LORD, I pray thee, turn the counsel of Ahithophel into foolishness. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V32">32&nbsp;</span>And it came to pass, that <span class='add'>when</span> David was come to the top <span class='add'>of the mount</span>, where he worshipped God, behold, Hushai the Archite came to meet him with his coat rent, and earth upon his head:  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&nbsp;</span>Unto whom David said, If thou passest on with me, then thou shalt be a burden unto me:  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&nbsp;</span>But if thou return to the city, and say unto Absalom, I will be thy servant, O king; <span class='add'>as</span> I <span class='add'>have been</span> thy father’s servant hitherto, so <span class='add'>will</span> I now also <span class='add'>be</span> thy servant: then mayest thou for me defeat the counsel of Ahithophel.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&nbsp;</span>And <span class='add'>hast thou</span> not there with thee Zadok and Abiathar the priests? therefore it shall be, <span class='add'>that</span> what thing soever thou shalt hear out of the king’s house, thou shalt tell <span class='add'>it</span> to Zadok and Abiathar the priests.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&nbsp;</span>Behold, <span class='add'>they have</span> there with them their two sons, Ahimaaz Zadok’s <span class='add'>son</span>, and Jonathan Abiathar’s <span class='add'>son;</span> and by them ye shall send unto me every thing that ye can hear.  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&nbsp;</span>So Hushai David’s friend came into the city, and Absalom came into Jerusalem. </div><ul class='tnav'>
