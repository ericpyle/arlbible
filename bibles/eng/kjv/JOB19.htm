 <span class="verse" id="V1">1&nbsp;</span>Then Job answered and said,  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span>How long will ye vex my soul, and break me in pieces with words?  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>These ten times have ye reproached me: ye are not ashamed <span class='add'>that</span> ye make yourselves strange to me.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>And be it indeed <span class='add'>that</span> I have erred, mine error remaineth with myself.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>If indeed ye will magnify <span class='add'>yourselves</span> against me, and plead against me my reproach:  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>Know now that God hath overthrown me, and hath compassed me with his net.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>Behold, I cry out of wrong, but I am not heard: I cry aloud, but <span class='add'>there is</span> no judgment.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>He hath fenced up my way that I cannot pass, and he hath set darkness in my paths.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>He hath stripped me of my glory, and taken the crown <span class='add'>from</span> my head.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>He hath destroyed me on every side, and I am gone: and mine hope hath he removed like a tree.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>He hath also kindled his wrath against me, and he counteth me unto him as <span class='add'>one of</span> his enemies.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>His troops come together, and raise up their way against me, and encamp round about my tabernacle.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>He hath put my brethren far from me, and mine acquaintance are verily estranged from me.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>My kinsfolk have failed, and my familiar friends have forgotten me.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>They that dwell in mine house, and my maids, count me for a stranger: I am an alien in their sight.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>I called my servant, and he gave <span class='add'>me</span> no answer; I intreated him with my mouth.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>My breath is strange to my wife, though I intreated for the children’s <span class='add'>sake</span> of mine own body.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>Yea, young children despised me; I arose, and they spake against me.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>All my inward friends abhorred me: and they whom I loved are turned against me.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>My bone cleaveth to my skin and to my flesh, and I am escaped with the skin of my teeth.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>Have pity upon me, have pity upon me, O ye my friends; for the hand of God hath touched me.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>Why do ye persecute me as God, and are not satisfied with my flesh?  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>Oh that my words were now written! oh that they were printed in a book!  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>That they were graven with an iron pen and lead in the rock for ever!  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>For I know <span class='add'>that</span> my redeemer liveth, and <span class='add'>that</span> he shall stand at the latter <span class='add'>day</span> upon the earth:  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>And <span class='add'>though</span> after my skin <span class='add'>worms</span> destroy this <span class='add'>body</span>, yet in my flesh shall I see God:  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>Whom I shall see for myself, and mine eyes shall behold, and not another; <span class='add'>though</span> my reins be consumed within me.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&nbsp;</span>But ye should say, Why persecute we him, seeing the root of the matter is found in me?  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&nbsp;</span>Be ye afraid of the sword: for wrath <span class='add'>bringeth</span> the punishments of the sword, that ye may know <span class='add'>there is</span> a judgment. </div><ul class='tnav'>
