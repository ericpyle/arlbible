 <span class="verse" id="V1">1&nbsp;</span>Now when all this was finished, all Israel that were present went out to the cities of Judah, and brake the images in pieces, and cut down the groves, and threw down the high places and the altars out of all Judah and Benjamin, in Ephraim also and Manasseh, until they had utterly destroyed them all. Then all the children of Israel returned, every man to his possession, into their own cities. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span>And Hezekiah appointed the courses of the priests and the Levites after their courses, every man according to his service, the priests and Levites for burnt offerings and for peace offerings, to minister, and to give thanks, and to praise in the gates of the tents of the LORD.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span> <span class='add'>He appointed</span> also the king’s portion of his substance for the burnt offerings, <span class='add'>to wit</span>, for the morning and evening burnt offerings, and the burnt offerings for the sabbaths, and for the new moons, and for the set feasts, as <span class='add'>it is</span> written in the law of the LORD.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>Moreover he commanded the people that dwelt in Jerusalem to give the portion of the priests and the Levites, that they might be encouraged in the law of the LORD. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>And as soon as the commandment came abroad, the children of Israel brought in abundance the firstfruits of corn, wine, and oil, and honey, and of all the increase of the field;
