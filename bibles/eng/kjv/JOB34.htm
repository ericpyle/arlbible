 <span class="verse" id="V1">1&nbsp;</span>Furthermore Elihu answered and said,  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span>Hear my words, O ye wise <span class='add'>men;</span> and give ear unto me, ye that have knowledge.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>For the ear trieth words, as the mouth tasteth meat.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>Let us choose to us judgment: let us know among ourselves what <span class='add'>is</span> good.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>For Job hath said, I am righteous: and God hath taken away my judgment.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>Should I lie against my right? my wound <span class='add'>is</span> incurable without transgression.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>What man <span class='add'>is</span> like Job, <span class='add'>who</span> drinketh up scorning like water?  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>Which goeth in company with the workers of iniquity, and walketh with wicked men.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>For he hath said, It profiteth a man nothing that he should delight himself with God.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>Therefore hearken unto me, ye men of understanding: far be it from God, <span class='add'>that he should do</span> wickedness; and <span class='add'>from</span> the Almighty, <span class='add'>that he should commit</span> iniquity.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>For the work of a man shall he render unto him, and cause every man to find according to <span class='add'>his</span> ways.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>Yea, surely God will not do wickedly, neither will the Almighty pervert judgment.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>Who hath given him a charge over the earth? or who hath disposed the whole world?  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>If he set his heart upon man, <span class='add'>if</span> he gather unto himself his spirit and his breath;  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>All flesh shall perish together, and man shall turn again unto dust.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>If now <span class='add'>thou hast</span> understanding, hear this: hearken to the voice of my words.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>Shall even he that hateth right govern? and wilt thou condemn him that is most just?  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span> <span class='add'>Is it fit</span> to say to a king, <span class='add'>Thou art</span> wicked? <span class='add'>and</span> to princes, <span class='add'>Ye are</span> ungodly?  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span> <span class='add'>How much less to him</span> that accepteth not the persons of princes, nor regardeth the rich more than the poor? for they all <span class='add'>are</span> the work of his hands.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>In a moment shall they die, and the people shall be troubled at midnight, and pass away: and the mighty shall be taken away without hand.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>For his eyes <span class='add'>are</span> upon the ways of man, and he seeth all his goings.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span> <span class='add'>There is</span> no darkness, nor shadow of death, where the workers of iniquity may hide themselves.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>For he will not lay upon man more <span class='add'>than right;</span> that he should enter into judgment with God.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>He shall break in pieces mighty men without number, and set others in their stead.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>Therefore he knoweth their works, and he overturneth <span class='add'>them</span> in the night, so that they are destroyed.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>He striketh them as wicked men in the open sight of others;  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>Because they turned back from him, and would not consider any of his ways:  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&nbsp;</span>So that they cause the cry of the poor to come unto him, and he heareth the cry of the afflicted.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&nbsp;</span>When he giveth quietness, who then can make trouble? and when he hideth <span class='add'>his</span> face, who then can behold him? whether <span class='add'>it be done</span> against a nation, or against a man only:  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&nbsp;</span>That the hypocrite reign not, lest the people be ensnared.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&nbsp;</span>Surely it is meet to be said unto God, I have borne <span class='add'>chastisement</span>, I will not offend <span class='add'>any more:</span>  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&nbsp;</span> <span class='add'>That which</span> I see not teach thou me: if I have done iniquity, I will do no more.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&nbsp;</span> <span class='add'>Should it be</span> according to thy mind? he will recompense it, whether thou refuse, or whether thou choose; and not I: therefore speak what thou knowest.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&nbsp;</span>Let men of understanding tell me, and let a wise man hearken unto me.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&nbsp;</span>Job hath spoken without knowledge, and his words <span class='add'>were</span> without wisdom.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&nbsp;</span>My desire <span class='add'>is that</span> Job may be tried unto the end because of <span class='add'>his</span> answers for wicked men.  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&nbsp;</span>For he addeth rebellion unto his sin, he clappeth <span class='add'>his hands</span> among us, and multiplieth his words against God. </div><ul class='tnav'>
