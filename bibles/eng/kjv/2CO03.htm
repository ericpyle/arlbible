 <span class="verse" id="V1">1&nbsp;</span> Do we begin again to commend ourselves? or need we, as some <span class='add'>others</span>, epistles of commendation to you, or <span class='add'>letters</span> of commendation from you?  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span> Ye are our epistle written in our hearts, known and read of all men:  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span> <span class='add'>Forasmuch as ye are</span> manifestly declared to be the epistle of Christ ministered by us, written not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; not in tables of stone, but in fleshy tables of the heart. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span> And such trust have we through Christ to God-ward:  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span> Not that we are sufficient of ourselves  to think any thing as of ourselves; but our sufficiency <span class='add'>is</span> of God;  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span> Who also hath made us able ministers of the new testament; not of the letter, but of the spirit: for the letter killeth, but the spirit giveth life.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span> But if the ministration of death, written <span class='add'>and</span> engraven in stones, was glorious, so that the children of Israel could not stedfastly behold the face of Moses for the glory of his countenance; which <span class='add'>glory</span> was to be done away:  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span> How shall not the ministration of the spirit be rather glorious?  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span> For if the ministration of condemnation <span class='add'>be</span> glory, much more doth the ministration of righteousness exceed in glory.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span> For even that which was made glorious had no glory  in this respect, by reason of the glory that excelleth.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span> For if that which is done away <span class='add'>was</span> glorious, much more that which remaineth <span class='add'>is</span> glorious.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span> Seeing then that we have such hope, we use great plainness of speech:  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span> And not as Moses , <span class='add'>which</span> put a vail over his face, that the children of Israel could not stedfastly look to the end of that which is abolished:  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span> But their minds were blinded: for until this day remaineth the same vail untaken away in the reading of the old testament; which <span class='add'>vail</span> is done away in Christ.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span> But even unto this day, when Moses is read, the vail is upon their heart.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span> Nevertheless when it shall turn to the Lord, the vail shall be taken away.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span> Now the Lord is that Spirit: and where the Spirit of the Lord <span class='add'>is</span>, there <span class='add'>is</span> liberty.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span> But we all, with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to glory, <span class='add'>even</span> as by the Spirit of the Lord. </div><ul class='tnav'>
