Surely, had I sent thee to them, they would have hearkened unto thee.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>But the house of Israel will not hearken unto thee; for they will not hearken unto me: for all the house of Israel <span class='add'>are</span> impudent and hardhearted.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>Behold, I have made thy face strong against their faces, and thy forehead strong against their foreheads.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>As an adamant harder than flint have I made thy forehead: fear them not, neither be dismayed at their looks, though they <span class='add'>be</span> a rebellious house.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>Moreover he said unto me, Son of man, all my words that I shall speak unto thee receive in thine heart, and hear with thine ears.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>And go, get thee to them of the captivity, unto the children of thy people, and speak unto them, and tell them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>Then the spirit took me up, and I heard behind me a voice of a great rushing, <span class='add'>saying</span>, Blessed <span class='add'>be</span> the glory of the LORD from his place.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span> <span class='add'>I heard</span> also the noise of the wings of the living creatures that touched one another, and the noise of the wheels over against them, and a noise of a great rushing.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>So the spirit lifted me up, and took me away, and I went in bitterness, in the heat of my spirit; but the hand of the LORD was strong upon me. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>Then I came to them of the captivity at Tel-abib, that dwelt by the river of Chebar, and I sat where they sat, and remained there astonished among them seven days.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>And it came to pass at the end of seven days, that the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>Son of man, I have made thee a watchman unto the house of Israel: therefore hear the word at my mouth, and give them warning from me.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>When I say unto the wicked, Thou shalt surely die; and thou givest him not warning, nor speakest to warn the wicked from his wicked way, to save his life; the same wicked <span class='add'>man</span> shall die in his iniquity; but his blood will I require at thine hand.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>Yet if thou warn the wicked, and he turn not from his wickedness, nor from his wicked way, he shall die in his iniquity; but thou hast delivered thy soul.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>Again, When a righteous <span class='add'>man</span> doth turn from his righteousness, and commit iniquity, and I lay a stumblingblock before him, he shall die: because thou hast not given him warning, he shall die in his sin, and his righteousness which he hath done shall not be remembered; but his blood will I require at thine hand.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>Nevertheless if thou warn the righteous <span class='add'>man</span>, that the righteous sin not, and he doth not sin, he shall surely live, because he is warned; also thou hast delivered thy soul. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>And the hand of the LORD was there upon me; and he said unto me, Arise, go forth into the plain, and I will there talk with thee.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>Then I arose, and went forth into the plain: and, behold, the glory of the LORD stood there, as the glory which I saw by the river of Chebar: and I fell on my face.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>Then the spirit entered into me, and set me upon my feet, and spake with me, and said unto me, Go, shut thyself within thine house.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>But thou, O son of man, behold, they shall put bands upon thee, and shall bind thee with them, and thou shalt not go out among them:  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>And I will make thy tongue cleave to the roof of thy mouth, that thou shalt be dumb, and shalt not be to them a reprover: for they <span class='add'>are</span> a rebellious house.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>But when I speak with thee, I will open thy mouth, and thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; He that heareth, let him hear; and he that forbeareth, let him forbear: for they <span class='add'>are</span> a rebellious house. </div><ul class='tnav'>
