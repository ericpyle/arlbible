 <span class="verse" id="V1">1&nbsp;</span>And the LORD said unto Samuel, How long wilt thou mourn for Saul, seeing I have rejected him from reigning over Israel? fill thine horn with oil, and go, I will send thee to Jesse the Bethlehemite: for I have provided me a king among his sons.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span>And Samuel said, How can I go? if Saul hear <span class='add'>it</span>, he will kill me. And the LORD said, Take an heifer with thee, and say, I am come to sacrifice to the LORD.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>And call Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will shew thee what thou shalt do: and thou shalt anoint unto me <span class='add'>him</span> whom I name unto thee.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>And Samuel did that which the LORD spake, and came to Beth-lehem. And the elders of the town trembled at his coming, and said, Comest thou peaceably?  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>And he said, Peaceably: I am come to sacrifice unto the LORD: sanctify yourselves, and come with me to the sacrifice. And he sanctified Jesse and his sons, and called them to the sacrifice. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>And it came to pass, when they were come, that he looked on Eliab, and said, Surely the LORD’s anointed <span class='add'>is</span> before him.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>But the LORD said unto Samuel, Look not on his countenance, or on the height of his stature; because I have refused him: for <span class='add'>the LORD seeth</span> not as man seeth; for man looketh on the outward appearance, but the LORD looketh on the heart.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>Then Jesse called Abinadab, and made him pass before Samuel. And he said, Neither hath the LORD chosen this.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>Then Jesse made Shammah to pass by. And he said, Neither hath the LORD chosen this.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>Again, Jesse made seven of his sons to pass before Samuel. And Samuel said unto Jesse, The LORD hath not chosen these.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>And Samuel said unto Jesse, Are here all <span class='add'>thy</span> children? And he said, There remaineth yet the youngest, and, behold, he keepeth the sheep. And Samuel said unto Jesse, Send and fetch him: for we will not sit down till he come hither.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>And he sent, and brought him in. Now he <span class='add'>was</span> ruddy, <span class='add'>and</span> withal of a beautiful countenance, and goodly to look to. And the LORD said, Arise, anoint him: for this <span class='add'>is</span> he.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>Then Samuel took the horn of oil, and anointed him in the midst of his brethren: and the Spirit of the LORD came upon David from that day forward. So Samuel rose up, and went to Ramah. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>But the Spirit of the LORD departed from Saul, and an evil spirit from the LORD troubled him.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>And Saul’s servants said unto him, Behold now, an evil spirit from God troubleth thee.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>Let our lord now command thy servants, <span class='add'>which are</span> before thee, to seek out a man, <span class='add'>who is</span> a cunning player on an harp: and it shall come to pass, when the evil spirit from God is upon thee, that he shall play with his hand, and thou shalt be well.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>And Saul said unto his servants, Provide me now a man that can play well, and bring <span class='add'>him</span> to me.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>Then answered one of the servants, and said, Behold, I have seen a son of Jesse the Bethlehemite, <span class='add'>that is</span> cunning in playing, and a mighty valiant man, and a man of war, and prudent in matters, and a comely person, and the LORD <span class='add'>is</span> with him. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>Wherefore Saul sent messengers unto Jesse, and said, Send me David thy son, which <span class='add'>is</span> with the sheep.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>And Jesse took an ass <span class='add'>laden</span> with bread, and a bottle of wine, and a kid, and sent <span class='add'>them</span> by David his son unto Saul.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>And David came to Saul, and stood before him: and he loved him greatly; and he became his armourbearer.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>And Saul sent to Jesse, saying, Let David, I pray thee, stand before me; for he hath found favour in my sight.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>And it came to pass, when the <span class='add'>evil</span> spirit from God was upon Saul, that David took an harp, and played with his hand: so Saul was refreshed, and was well, and the evil spirit departed from him. </div><ul class='tnav'>
