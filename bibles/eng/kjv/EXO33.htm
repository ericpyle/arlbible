 <span class="verse" id="V1">1&nbsp;</span>And the LORD said unto Moses, Depart, <span class='add'>and</span> go up hence, thou and the people which thou hast brought up out of the land of Egypt, unto the land which I sware unto Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, saying, Unto thy seed will I give it:  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span>And I will send an angel before thee; and I will drive out the Canaanite, the Amorite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite:  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>Unto a land flowing with milk and honey: for I will not go up in the midst of thee; for thou <span class='add'>art</span> a stiffnecked people: lest I consume thee in the way. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>And when the people heard these evil tidings, they mourned: and no man did put on him his ornaments.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>For the LORD had said unto Moses, Say unto the children of Israel, Ye <span class='add'>are</span> a stiffnecked people: I will come up into the midst of thee in a moment, and consume thee: therefore now put off thy ornaments from thee, that I may know what to do unto thee.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>And the children of Israel stripped themselves of their ornaments by the mount Horeb.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>And Moses took the tabernacle, and pitched it without the camp, afar off from the camp, and called it the Tabernacle of the congregation. And it came to pass, <span class='add'>that</span> every one which sought the LORD went out unto the tabernacle of the congregation, which <span class='add'>was</span> without the camp.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>And it came to pass, when Moses went out unto the tabernacle, <span class='add'>that</span> all the people rose up, and stood every man <span class='add'>at</span> his tent door, and looked after Moses, until he was gone into the tabernacle.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>And it came to pass, as Moses entered into the tabernacle, the cloudy pillar descended, and stood <span class='add'>at</span> the door of the tabernacle, and <span class='add'>the LORD</span> talked with Moses.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>And all the people saw the cloudy pillar stand <span class='add'>at</span> the tabernacle door: and all the people rose up and worshipped, every man <span class='add'>in</span> his tent door.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>And the LORD spake unto Moses face to face, as a man speaketh unto his friend. And he turned again into the camp: but his servant Joshua, the son of Nun, a young man, departed not out of the tabernacle. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>And Moses said unto the LORD, See, thou sayest unto me, Bring up this people: and thou hast not let me know whom thou wilt send with me. Yet thou hast said, I know thee by name, and thou hast also found grace in my sight.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>Now therefore, I pray thee, if I have found grace in thy sight, shew me now thy way, that I may know thee, that I may find grace in thy sight: and consider that this nation <span class='add'>is</span> thy people.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>And he said, My presence shall go <span class='add'>with thee</span>, and I will give thee rest.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>And he said unto him, If thy presence go not <span class='add'>with me</span>, carry us not up hence.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>For wherein shall it be known here that I and thy people have found grace in thy sight? <span class='add'>is it</span> not in that thou goest with us? so shall we be separated, I and thy people, from all the people that <span class='add'>are</span> upon the face of the earth.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>And the LORD said unto Moses, I will do this thing also that thou hast spoken: for thou hast found grace in my sight, and I know thee by name.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>And he said, I beseech thee, shew me thy glory.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>And he said, I will make all my goodness pass before thee, and I will proclaim the name of the LORD before thee; and will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and will shew mercy on whom I will shew mercy.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>And he said, Thou canst not see my face: for there shall no man see me, and live.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>And the LORD said, Behold, <span class='add'>there is</span> a place by me, and thou shalt stand upon a rock:  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>And it shall come to pass, while my glory passeth by, that I will put thee in a clift of the rock, and will cover thee with my hand while I pass by:  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>And I will take away mine hand, and thou shalt see my back parts: but my face shall not be seen. </div><ul class='tnav'>
