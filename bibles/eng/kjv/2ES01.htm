 <span class="verse" id="V1">1&nbsp;</span>The second book of the prophet Esdras, the son of Saraias, the son of Azarias, the son of Helchias, the son of Sadamias, the son of Sadoc, the son of Achitob, </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span>The son of Achias, the son of Phinees, the son of Heli, the son of Amarias, the son of Aziei, the son of Marimoth, the son of Arna, the son of Ozias, the son of Borith, the son of Abisei, the son of Phinees, the son of Eleazar, </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>The son of Aaron, of the tribe of Levi; which was captive in the land of the Medes, in the reign of Artexerxes king of the Persians. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>And the word of the Lord came unto me, saying, </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>Go thy way, and shew my people their sinful deeds, and their children their wickedness which they have done against me; that they may tell their children’s children: </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>Because the sins of their fathers are increased in them: for they have forgotten me, and have offered unto strange gods. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>Am not I even he that brought them out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage? but they have provoked me unto wrath, and despised my counsels. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>Pull thou off then the hair of thy head, and cast all evil upon them, for they have not been obedient unto my law, but it is a rebellious people. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>How long shall I forbear them, into whom I have done so much good? </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>Many kings have I destroyed for their sakes; Pharaoh with his servants and all his power have I smitten down. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>All the nations have I destroyed before them, and in the east I have scattered the people of two provinces, even of Tyrus and Sidon, and have slain all their enemies. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>Speak thou therefore unto them, saying, Thus saith the Lord, </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>I led you through the sea and in the beginning gave you a large and safe passage; I gave you Moses for a leader, and Aaron for a priest. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>I gave you light in a pillar of fire, and great wonders have I done among you; yet have ye forgotten me, saith the Lord. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>Thus saith the Almighty Lord, The quails were as a token to you; I gave you tents for your safeguard: nevertheless ye murmured there, </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>And triumphed not in my name for the destruction of your enemies, but ever to this day do ye yet murmur. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>Where are the benefits that I have done for you? when ye were hungry and thirsty in the wilderness, did ye not cry unto me, </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>Saying, Why hast thou brought us into this wilderness to kill us? it had been better for us to have served the Egyptians, than to die in this wilderness. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>Then had I pity upon your mournings, and gave you manna to eat; so ye did eat angels’ bread. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>When ye were thirsty, did I not cleave the rock, and waters flowed out to your fill? for the heat I covered you with the leaves of the trees. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>I divided among you a fruitful land, I cast out the Canaanites, the Pherezites, and the Philistines, before you: what shall I yet do more for you? saith the Lord. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>Thus saith the Almighty Lord, When ye were in the wilderness, in the river of the Amorites, being athirst, and blaspheming my name, </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>I gave you not fire for your blasphemies, but cast a tree in the water, and made the river sweet. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>What shall I do unto thee, O Jacob? thou, Juda, wouldest not obey me: I will turn me to other nations, and unto those will I give my name, that they may keep my statutes. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>Seeing ye have forsaken me, I will forsake you also; when ye desire me to be gracious unto you, I shall have no mercy upon you. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>Whensoever ye shall call upon me, I will not hear you: for ye have defiled your hands with blood, and your feet are swift to commit manslaughter. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>Ye have not as it were forsaken me, but your own selves, saith the Lord. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V28">28&nbsp;</span>Thus saith the Almighty Lord, Have I not prayed you as a father his sons, as a mother her daughters, and a nurse her young babes, </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V29">29&nbsp;</span>That ye would be my people, and I should be your God; that ye would be my children, and I should be your father?
