 <span class="verse" id="V1">1&nbsp;</span>Now therefore hearken, O Israel, unto the statutes and unto the judgments, which I teach you, for to do <span class='add'>them</span>, that ye may live, and go in and possess the land which the LORD God of your fathers giveth you.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span>Ye shall not add unto the word which I command you, neither shall ye diminish <span class='add'>ought</span> from it, that ye may keep the commandments of the LORD your God which I command you.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>Your eyes have seen what the LORD did because of Baal-peor: for all the men that followed Baal-peor, the LORD thy God hath destroyed them from among you.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>But ye that did cleave unto the LORD your God <span class='add'>are</span> alive every one of you this day.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>Behold, I have taught you statutes and judgments, even as the LORD my God commanded me, that ye should do so in the land whither ye go to possess it.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>Keep therefore and do <span class='add'>them;</span> for this <span class='add'>is</span> your wisdom and your understanding in the sight of the nations, which shall hear all these statutes, and say, Surely this great nation <span class='add'>is</span> a wise and understanding people.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>For what nation <span class='add'>is there so</span> great, who <span class='add'>hath</span> God <span class='add'>so</span> nigh unto them, as the LORD our God <span class='add'>is</span> in all <span class='add'>things that</span> we call upon him <span class='add'>for?</span>  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>And what nation <span class='add'>is there so</span> great, that hath statutes and judgments <span class='add'>so</span> righteous as all this law, which I set before you this day?  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>Only take heed to thyself, and keep thy soul diligently, lest thou forget the things which thine eyes have seen, and lest they depart from thy heart all the days of thy life: but teach them thy sons, and thy sons’ sons;  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span> <span class='add'>Specially</span> the day that thou stoodest before the LORD thy God in Horeb, when the LORD said unto me, Gather me the people together, and I will make them hear my words, that they may learn to fear me all the days that they shall live upon the earth, and <span class='add'>that</span> they may teach their children.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>And ye came near and stood under the mountain; and the mountain burned with fire unto the midst of heaven, with darkness, clouds, and thick darkness.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>And the LORD spake unto you out of the midst of the fire: ye heard the voice of the words, but saw no similitude; only <span class='add'>ye heard</span> a voice.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>And he declared unto you his covenant, which he commanded you to perform, <span class='add'>even</span> ten commandments;

for ye saw no manner of similitude on the day <span class='add'>that</span> the LORD spake unto you in Horeb out of the midst of the fire:  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>Lest ye corrupt <span class='add'>yourselves</span>, and make you a graven image, the similitude of any figure, the likeness of male or female,  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>The likeness of any beast that <span class='add'>is</span> on the earth, the likeness of any winged fowl that flieth in the air,  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>The likeness of any thing that creepeth on the ground, the likeness of any fish that <span class='add'>is</span> in the waters beneath the earth:  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>And lest thou lift up thine eyes unto heaven, and when thou seest the sun, and the moon, and the stars, <span class='add'>even</span> all the host of heaven, shouldest be driven to worship them, and serve them, which the LORD thy God hath divided unto all nations under the whole heaven.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>But the LORD hath taken you, and brought you forth out of the iron furnace, <span class='add'>even</span> out of Egypt, to be unto him a people of inheritance, as <span class='add'>ye are</span> this day.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>Furthermore the LORD was angry with me for your sakes, and sware that I should not go over Jordan, and that I should not go in unto that good land, which the LORD thy God giveth thee <span class='add'>for</span> an inheritance:  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>But I must die in this land, I must not go over Jordan: but ye shall go over, and possess that good land.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>Take heed unto yourselves, lest ye forget the covenant of the LORD your God, which he made with you, and make you a graven image, <span class='add'>or</span> the likeness of any <span class='add'>thing</span>, which the LORD thy God hath forbidden thee.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>For the LORD thy God <span class='add'>is</span> a consuming fire, <span class='add'>even</span> a jealous God. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>When thou shalt beget children, and children’s children, and ye shall have remained long in the land, and shall corrupt <span class='add'>yourselves</span>, and make a graven image, <span class='add'>or</span> the likeness of any <span class='add'>thing</span>, and shall do evil in the sight of the LORD thy God, to provoke him to anger:  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>I call heaven and earth to witness against you this day, that ye shall soon utterly perish from off the land whereunto ye go over Jordan to possess it; ye shall not prolong <span class='add'>your</span> days upon it, but shall utterly be destroyed.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>And the LORD shall scatter you among the nations, and ye shall be left few in number among the heathen, whither the LORD shall lead you.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&nbsp;</span>And there ye shall serve gods, the work of men’s hands, wood and stone, which neither see, nor hear, nor eat, nor smell.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&nbsp;</span>But if from thence thou shalt seek the LORD thy God, thou shalt find <span class='add'>him</span>, if thou seek him with all thy heart and with all thy soul.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&nbsp;</span>When thou art in tribulation, and all these things are come upon thee, <span class='add'>even</span> in the latter days, if thou turn to the LORD thy God, and shalt be obedient unto his voice;
