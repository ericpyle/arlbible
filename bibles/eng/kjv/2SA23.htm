 <span class="verse" id="V1">1&nbsp;</span>Now these <span class='add'>be</span> the last words of David. David the son of Jesse said, and the man <span class='add'>who was</span> raised up on high, the anointed of the God of Jacob, and the sweet psalmist of Israel, said,  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span>The Spirit of the LORD spake by me, and his word <span class='add'>was</span> in my tongue.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>The God of Israel said, the Rock of Israel spake to me, He that ruleth over men <span class='add'>must be</span> just, ruling in the fear of God.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>And <span class='add'>he shall be</span> as the light of the morning, <span class='add'>when</span> the sun riseth, <span class='add'>even</span> a morning without clouds; <span class='add'>as</span> the tender grass <span class='add'>springing</span> out of the earth by clear shining after rain.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>Although my house <span class='add'>be</span> not so with God; yet he hath made with me an everlasting covenant, ordered in all <span class='add'>things</span>, and sure: for <span class='add'>this is</span> all my salvation, and all <span class='add'>my</span> desire, although he make <span class='add'>it</span> not to grow. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>But <span class='add'>the sons</span> of Belial <span class='add'>shall be</span> all of them as thorns thrust away, because they cannot be taken with hands:  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>But the man <span class='add'>that</span> shall touch them must be fenced with iron and the staff of a spear; and they shall be utterly burned with fire in the <span class='add'>same</span> place. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>These <span class='add'>be</span> the names of the mighty men whom David had: The Tachmonite that sat in the seat, chief among the captains; the same <span class='add'>was</span> Adino the Eznite: <span class='add'>he lift up his spear</span> against eight hundred, whom he slew at one time.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>And after him <span class='add'>was</span> Eleazar the son of Dodo the Ahohite, <span class='add'>one</span> of the three mighty men with David, when they defied the Philistines <span class='add'>that</span> were there gathered together to battle, and the men of Israel were gone away:  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>He arose, and smote the Philistines until his hand was weary, and his hand clave unto the sword: and the LORD wrought a great victory that day; and the people returned after him only to spoil.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>And after him <span class='add'>was</span> Shammah the son of Agee the Hararite. And the Philistines were gathered together into a troop, where was a piece of ground full of lentiles: and the people fled from the Philistines.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>But he stood in the midst of the ground, and defended it, and slew the Philistines: and the LORD wrought a great victory.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>And three of the thirty chief went down, and came to David in the harvest time unto the cave of Adullam: and the troop of the Philistines pitched in the valley of Rephaim.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>And David <span class='add'>was</span> then in an hold, and the garrison of the Philistines <span class='add'>was</span> then <span class='add'>in</span> Beth-lehem.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>And David longed, and said, Oh that one would give me drink of the water of the well of Beth-lehem, which <span class='add'>is</span> by the gate!  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>And the three mighty men brake through the host of the Philistines, and drew water out of the well of Beth-lehem, that <span class='add'>was</span> by the gate, and took <span class='add'>it</span>, and brought <span class='add'>it</span> to David: nevertheless he would not drink thereof, but poured it out unto the LORD.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>And he said, Be it far from me, O LORD, that I should do this: <span class='add'>is not this</span> the blood of the men that went in jeopardy of their lives? therefore he would not drink it. These things did these three mighty men.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>And Abishai, the brother of Joab, the son of Zeruiah, was chief among three. And he lifted up his spear against three hundred, <span class='add'>and</span> slew <span class='add'>them</span>, and had the name among three.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>Was he not most honourable of three? therefore he was their captain: howbeit he attained not unto the <span class='add'>first</span> three.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the son of a valiant man, of Kabzeel, who had done many acts, he slew two lionlike men of Moab: he went down also and slew a lion in the midst of a pit in time of snow:  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>And he slew an Egyptian, a goodly man: and the Egyptian had a spear in his hand; but he went down to him with a staff, and plucked the spear out of the Egyptian’s hand, and slew him with his own spear.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>These <span class='add'>things</span> did Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and had the name among three mighty men.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>He was more honourable than the thirty, but he attained not to the <span class='add'>first</span> three.
