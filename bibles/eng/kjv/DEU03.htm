 <span class="verse" id="V1">1&nbsp;</span>Then we turned, and went up the way to Bashan: and Og the king of Bashan came out against us, he and all his people, to battle at Edrei.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span>And the LORD said unto me, Fear him not: for I will deliver him, and all his people, and his land, into thy hand; and thou shalt do unto him as thou didst unto Sihon king of the Amorites, which dwelt at Heshbon.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>So the LORD our God delivered into our hands Og also, the king of Bashan, and all his people: and we smote him until none was left to him remaining.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>And we took all his cities at that time, there was not a city which we took not from them, threescore cities, all the region of Argob, the kingdom of Og in Bashan.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>All these cities <span class='add'>were</span> fenced with high walls, gates, and bars; beside unwalled towns a great many.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>And we utterly destroyed them, as we did unto Sihon king of Heshbon, utterly destroying the men, women, and children, of every city.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>But all the cattle, and the spoil of the cities, we took for a prey to ourselves.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>And we took at that time out of the hand of the two kings of the Amorites the land that <span class='add'>was</span> on this side Jordan, from the river of Arnon unto mount Hermon;  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>(<span class='add'>Which</span> Hermon the Sidonians call Sirion; and the Amorites call it Shenir;)  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>All the cities of the plain, and all Gilead, and all Bashan, unto Salchah and Edrei, cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>For only Og king of Bashan remained of the remnant of giants; behold, his bedstead <span class='add'>was</span> a bedstead of iron; is it not in Rabbath of the children of Ammon? nine cubits was the length thereof, and four cubits the breadth of it, after the cubit of a man.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>And this land, <span class='add'>which</span> we possessed at that time, from Aroer, which <span class='add'>is</span> by the river Arnon, and half mount Gilead, and the cities thereof, gave I unto the Reubenites and to the Gadites.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>And the rest of Gilead, and all Bashan, <span class='add'>being</span> the kingdom of Og, gave I unto the half tribe of Manasseh; all the region of Argob, with all Bashan, which was called the land of giants.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>Jair the son of Manasseh took all the country of Argob unto the coasts of Geshuri and Maachathi; and called them after his own name, Bashan-havoth-jair, unto this day.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>And I gave Gilead unto Machir.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>And unto the Reubenites and unto the Gadites I gave from Gilead even unto the river Arnon half the valley, and the border even unto the river Jabbok, <span class='add'>which is</span> the border of the children of Ammon;  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>The plain also, and Jordan, and the coast <span class='add'>thereof</span>, from Chinnereth even unto the sea of the plain, <span class='add'>even</span> the salt sea, under Ashdoth-pisgah eastward. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>And I commanded you at that time, saying, The LORD your God hath given you this land to possess it: ye shall pass over armed before your brethren the children of Israel, all <span class='add'>that are</span> meet for the war.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>But your wives, and your little ones, and your cattle, (<span class='add'>for</span> I know that ye have much cattle,) shall abide in your cities which I have given you;  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>Until the LORD have given rest unto your brethren, as well as unto you, and <span class='add'>until</span> they also possess the land which the LORD your God hath given them beyond Jordan: and <span class='add'>then</span> shall ye return every man unto his possession, which I have given you. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>And I commanded Joshua at that time, saying, Thine eyes have seen all that the LORD your God hath done unto these two kings: so shall the LORD do unto all the kingdoms whither thou passest.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>Ye shall not fear them: for the LORD your God he shall fight for you.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>And I besought the LORD at that time, saying,  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>O Lord GOD, thou hast begun to shew thy servant thy greatness, and thy mighty hand: for what God <span class='add'>is there</span> in heaven or in earth, that can do according to thy works, and according to thy might?  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>I pray thee, let me go over, and see the good land that <span class='add'>is</span> beyond Jordan, that goodly mountain, and Lebanon.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>But the LORD was wroth with me for your sakes, and would not hear me: and the LORD said unto me, Let it suffice thee; speak no more unto me of this matter.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>Get thee up into the top of Pisgah, and lift up thine eyes westward, and northward, and southward, and eastward, and behold <span class='add'>it</span> with thine eyes: for thou shalt not go over this Jordan.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&nbsp;</span>But charge Joshua, and encourage him, and strengthen him: for he shall go over before this people, and he shall cause them to inherit the land which thou shalt see.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&nbsp;</span>So we abode in the valley over against Beth-peor. </div><ul class='tnav'>
