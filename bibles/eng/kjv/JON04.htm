 <span class="verse" id="V1">1&nbsp;</span>But it displeased Jonah exceedingly, and he was very angry.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span>And he prayed unto the LORD, and said, I pray thee, O LORD, <span class='add'>was</span> not this my saying, when I was yet in my country? Therefore I fled before unto Tarshish: for I knew that thou <span class='add'>art</span> a gracious God, and merciful, slow to anger, and of great kindness, and repentest thee of the evil.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>Therefore now, O LORD, take, I beseech thee, my life from me; for <span class='add'>it is</span> better for me to die than to live. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>Then said the LORD, Doest thou well to be angry?  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>So Jonah went out of the city, and sat on the east side of the city, and there made him a booth, and sat under it in the shadow, till he might see what would become of the city.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>And the LORD God prepared a gourd, and made <span class='add'>it</span> to come up over Jonah, that it might be a shadow over his head, to deliver him from his grief. So Jonah was exceeding glad of the gourd.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>But God prepared a worm when the morning rose the next day, and it smote the gourd that it withered.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>And it came to pass, when the sun did arise, that God prepared a vehement east wind; and the sun beat upon the head of Jonah, that he fainted, and wished in himself to die, and said, <span class='add'>It is</span> better for me to die than to live.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>And God said to Jonah, Doest thou well to be angry for the gourd? And he said, I do well to be angry, <span class='add'>even</span> unto death.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>Then said the LORD, Thou hast had pity on the gourd, for the which thou hast not laboured, neither madest it grow; which came up in a night, and perished in a night:  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>And should not I spare Nineveh, that great city, wherein are more than sixscore thousand persons that cannot discern between their right hand and their left hand; and <span class='add'>also</span> much cattle? </div><ul class='tnav'>
