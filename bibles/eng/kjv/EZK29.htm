 <span class="verse" id="V1">1&nbsp;</span>In the tenth year, in the tenth <span class='add'>month</span>, in the twelfth <span class='add'>day</span> of the month, the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span>Son of man, set thy face against Pharaoh king of Egypt, and prophesy against him, and against all Egypt:  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>Speak, and say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I <span class='add'>am</span> against thee, Pharaoh king of Egypt, the great dragon that lieth in the midst of his rivers, which hath said, My river <span class='add'>is</span> mine own, and I have made <span class='add'>it</span> for myself.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>But I will put hooks in thy jaws, and I will cause the fish of thy rivers to stick unto thy scales, and I will bring thee up out of the midst of thy rivers, and all the fish of thy rivers shall stick unto thy scales.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>And I will leave thee <span class='add'>thrown</span> into the wilderness, thee and all the fish of thy rivers: thou shalt fall upon the open fields; thou shalt not be brought together, nor gathered: I have given thee for meat to the beasts of the field and to the fowls of the heaven.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>And all the inhabitants of Egypt shall know that I <span class='add'>am</span> the LORD, because they have been a staff of reed to the house of Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>When they took hold of thee by thy hand, thou didst break, and rend all their shoulder: and when they leaned upon thee, thou brakest, and madest all their loins to be at a stand. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will bring a sword upon thee, and cut off man and beast out of thee.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>And the land of Egypt shall be desolate and waste; and they shall know that I <span class='add'>am</span> the LORD: because he hath said, The river <span class='add'>is</span> mine, and I have made <span class='add'>it</span>.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>Behold, therefore I <span class='add'>am</span> against thee, and against thy rivers, and I will make the land of Egypt utterly waste <span class='add'>and</span> desolate, from the tower of Syene even unto the border of Ethiopia.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>No foot of man shall pass through it, nor foot of beast shall pass through it, neither shall it be inhabited forty years.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>And I will make the land of Egypt desolate in the midst of the countries <span class='add'>that are</span> desolate, and her cities among the cities <span class='add'>that are</span> laid waste shall be desolate forty years: and I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations, and will disperse them through the countries. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>Yet thus saith the Lord GOD; At the end of forty years will I gather the Egyptians from the people whither they were scattered:  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>And I will bring again the captivity of Egypt, and will cause them to return <span class='add'>into</span> the land of Pathros, into the land of their habitation; and they shall be there a base kingdom.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>It shall be the basest of the kingdoms; neither shall it exalt itself any more above the nations: for I will diminish them, that they shall no more rule over the nations.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>And it shall be no more the confidence of the house of Israel, which bringeth <span class='add'>their</span> iniquity to remembrance, when they shall look after them: but they shall know that I <span class='add'>am</span> the Lord GOD. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>And it came to pass in the seven and twentieth year, in the first <span class='add'>month</span>, in the first <span class='add'>day</span> of the month, the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>Son of man, Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon caused his army to serve a great service against Tyrus: every head <span class='add'>was</span> made bald, and every shoulder <span class='add'>was</span> peeled: yet had he no wages, nor his army, for Tyrus, for the service that he had served against it:  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will give the land of Egypt unto Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon; and he shall take her multitude, and take her spoil, and take her prey; and it shall be the wages for his army.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>I have given him the land of Egypt <span class='add'>for</span> his labour wherewith he served against it, because they wrought for me, saith the Lord GOD. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>In that day will I cause the horn of the house of Israel to bud forth, and I will give thee the opening of the mouth in the midst of them;
