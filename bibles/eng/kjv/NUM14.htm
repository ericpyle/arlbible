 <span class="verse" id="V1">1&nbsp;</span>And all the congregation lifted up their voice, and cried; and the people wept that night.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span>And all the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron: and the whole congregation said unto them, Would God that we had died in the land of Egypt! or would God we had died in this wilderness!  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>And wherefore hath the LORD brought us unto this land, to fall by the sword, that our wives and our children should be a prey? were it not better for us to return into Egypt?  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>And they said one to another, Let us make a captain, and let us return into Egypt.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>Then Moses and Aaron fell on their faces before all the assembly of the congregation of the children of Israel. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>And Joshua the son of Nun, and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, <span class='add'>which were</span> of them that searched the land, rent their clothes:  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>And they spake unto all the company of the children of Israel, saying, The land, which we passed through to search it, <span class='add'>is</span> an exceeding good land.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>If the LORD delight in us, then he will bring us into this land, and give it us; a land which floweth with milk and honey.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>Only rebel not ye against the LORD, neither fear ye the people of the land; for they <span class='add'>are</span> bread for us: their defence is departed from them, and the LORD <span class='add'>is</span> with us: fear them not.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>But all the congregation bade stone them with stones.
