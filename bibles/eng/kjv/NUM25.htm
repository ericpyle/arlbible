 <span class="verse" id="V1">1&nbsp;</span>And Israel abode in Shittim, and the people began to commit whoredom with the daughters of Moab.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span>And they called the people unto the sacrifices of their gods: and the people did eat, and bowed down to their gods.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>And Israel joined himself unto Baal-peor: and the anger of the LORD was kindled against Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>And the LORD said unto Moses, Take all the heads of the people, and hang them up before the LORD against the sun, that the fierce anger of the LORD may be turned away from Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>And Moses said unto the judges of Israel, Slay ye every one his men that were joined unto Baal-peor. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>And, behold, one of the children of Israel came and brought unto his brethren a Midianitish woman in the sight of Moses, and in the sight of all the congregation of the children of Israel, who <span class='add'>were</span> weeping <span class='add'>before</span> the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>And when Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, saw <span class='add'>it</span>, he rose up from among the congregation, and took a javelin in his hand;  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>And he went after the man of Israel into the tent, and thrust both of them through, the man of Israel, and the woman through her belly.
