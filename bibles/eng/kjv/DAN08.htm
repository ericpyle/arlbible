 <span class="verse" id="V1">1&nbsp;</span>In the third year of the reign of king Belshazzar a vision appeared unto me, <span class='add'>even unto</span> me Daniel, after that which appeared unto me at the first.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span>And I saw in a vision; and it came to pass, when I saw, that I <span class='add'>was</span> at Shushan <span class='add'>in</span> the palace, which <span class='add'>is</span> in the province of Elam; and I saw in a vision, and I was by the river of Ulai.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>Then I lifted up mine eyes, and saw, and, behold, there stood before the river a ram which had <span class='add'>two</span> horns: and the <span class='add'>two</span> horns <span class='add'>were</span> high; but one <span class='add'>was</span> higher than the other, and the higher came up last.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>I saw the ram pushing westward, and northward, and southward; so that no beasts might stand before him, neither <span class='add'>was there any</span> that could deliver out of his hand; but he did according to his will, and became great.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>And as I was considering, behold, an he goat came from the west on the face of the whole earth, and touched not the ground: and the goat <span class='add'>had</span> a notable horn between his eyes.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>And he came to the ram that had <span class='add'>two</span> horns, which I had seen standing before the river, and ran unto him in the fury of his power.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>And I saw him come close unto the ram, and he was moved with choler against him, and smote the ram, and brake his two horns: and there was no power in the ram to stand before him, but he cast him down to the ground, and stamped upon him: and there was none that could deliver the ram out of his hand.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>Therefore the he goat waxed very great: and when he was strong, the great horn was broken; and for it came up four notable ones toward the four winds of heaven.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>And out of one of them came forth a little horn, which waxed exceeding great, toward the south, and toward the east, and toward the pleasant <span class='add'>land</span>.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>And it waxed great, <span class='add'>even</span> to the host of heaven; and it cast down <span class='add'>some</span> of the host and of the stars to the ground, and stamped upon them.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>Yea, he magnified <span class='add'>himself</span> even to the prince of the host, and by him the daily <span class='add'>sacrifice</span> was taken away, and the place of his sanctuary was cast down.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>And an host was given <span class='add'>him</span> against the daily <span class='add'>sacrifice</span> by reason of transgression, and it cast down the truth to the ground; and it practised, and prospered. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>Then I heard one saint speaking, and another saint said unto that certain <span class='add'>saint</span> which spake, How long <span class='add'>shall be</span> the vision <span class='add'>concerning</span> the daily <span class='add'>sacrifice</span>, and the transgression of desolation, to give both the sanctuary and the host to be trodden under foot?  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>And he said unto me, Unto two thousand and three hundred days; then shall the sanctuary be cleansed. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>And it came to pass, when I, <span class='add'>even</span> I Daniel, had seen the vision, and sought for the meaning, then, behold, there stood before me as the appearance of a man.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>And I heard a man’s voice between <span class='add'>the banks of</span> Ulai, which called, and said, Gabriel, make this <span class='add'>man</span> to understand the vision.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>So he came near where I stood: and when he came, I was afraid, and fell upon my face: but he said unto me, Understand, O son of man: for at the time of the end <span class='add'>shall be</span> the vision.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>Now as he was speaking with me, I was in a deep sleep on my face toward the ground: but he touched me, and set me upright.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>And he said, Behold, I will make thee know what shall be in the last end of the indignation: for at the time appointed the end <span class='add'>shall be</span>.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>The ram which thou sawest having <span class='add'>two</span> horns <span class='add'>are</span> the kings of Media and Persia.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>And the rough goat <span class='add'>is</span> the king of Grecia: and the great horn that <span class='add'>is</span> between his eyes <span class='add'>is</span> the first king.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>Now that being broken, whereas four stood up for it, four kingdoms shall stand up out of the nation, but not in his power.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>And in the latter time of their kingdom, when the transgressors are come to the full, a king of fierce countenance, and understanding dark sentences, shall stand up.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>And his power shall be mighty, but not by his own power: and he shall destroy wonderfully, and shall prosper, and practise, and shall destroy the mighty and the holy people.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>And through his policy also he shall cause craft to prosper in his hand; and he shall magnify <span class='add'>himself</span> in his heart, and by peace shall destroy many: he shall also stand up against the Prince of princes; but he shall be broken without hand.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>And the vision of the evening and the morning which was told <span class='add'>is</span> true: wherefore shut thou up the vision; for it <span class='add'>shall be</span> for many days.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>And I Daniel fainted, and was sick <span class='add'>certain</span> days; afterward I rose up, and did the king’s business; and I was astonished at the vision, but none understood <span class='add'>it</span>. </div><ul class='tnav'>
