 <span class="verse" id="V1">1&nbsp;</span>Elihu also proceeded, and said,  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span>Suffer me a little, and I will shew thee that <span class='add'>I have</span> yet to speak on God’s behalf.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>I will fetch my knowledge from afar, and will ascribe righteousness to my Maker.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>For truly my words <span class='add'>shall</span> not <span class='add'>be</span> false: he that is perfect in knowledge <span class='add'>is</span> with thee.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>Behold, God <span class='add'>is</span> mighty, and despiseth not <span class='add'>any: he is</span> mighty in strength <span class='add'>and</span> wisdom.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>He preserveth not the life of the wicked: but giveth right to the poor.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>He withdraweth not his eyes from the righteous: but with kings <span class='add'>are they</span> on the throne; yea, he doth establish them for ever, and they are exalted.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>And if <span class='add'>they be</span> bound in fetters, <span class='add'>and</span> be holden in cords of affliction;  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>Then he sheweth them their work, and their transgressions that they have exceeded.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>He openeth also their ear to discipline, and commandeth that they return from iniquity.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>If they obey and serve <span class='add'>him</span>, they shall spend their days in prosperity, and their years in pleasures.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>But if they obey not, they shall perish by the sword, and they shall die without knowledge.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>But the hypocrites in heart heap up wrath: they cry not when he bindeth them.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>They die in youth, and their life <span class='add'>is</span> among the unclean.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>He delivereth the poor in his affliction, and openeth their ears in oppression.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>Even so would he have removed thee out of the strait <span class='add'>into</span> a broad place, where <span class='add'>there is</span> no straitness; and that which <span class='add'>should be</span> set on thy table should be full of fatness.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>But thou hast fulfilled the judgment of the wicked: judgment and justice take hold <span class='add'>on thee</span>.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>Because <span class='add'>there is</span> wrath, <span class='add'>beware</span> lest he take thee away with <span class='add'>his</span> stroke: then a great ransom cannot deliver thee.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>Will he esteem thy riches? <span class='add'>no</span>, not gold, nor all the forces of strength.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>Desire not the night, when people are cut off in their place.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>Take heed, regard not iniquity: for this hast thou chosen rather than affliction.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>Behold, God exalteth by his power: who teacheth like him?  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>Who hath enjoined him his way? or who can say, Thou hast wrought iniquity?  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>Remember that thou magnify his work, which men behold.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>Every man may see it; man may behold <span class='add'>it</span> afar off.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>Behold, God <span class='add'>is</span> great, and we know <span class='add'>him</span> not, neither can the number of his years be searched out.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>For he maketh small the drops of water: they pour down rain according to the vapour thereof:  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&nbsp;</span>Which the clouds do drop <span class='add'>and</span> distil upon man abundantly.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&nbsp;</span>Also can <span class='add'>any</span> understand the spreadings of the clouds, <span class='add'>or</span> the noise of his tabernacle?  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&nbsp;</span>Behold, he spreadeth his light upon it, and covereth the bottom of the sea.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&nbsp;</span>For by them judgeth he the people; he giveth meat in abundance.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&nbsp;</span>With clouds he covereth the light; and commandeth it <span class='add'>not to shine</span> by <span class='add'>the cloud</span> that cometh betwixt.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&nbsp;</span>The noise thereof sheweth concerning it, the cattle also concerning the vapour. </div><ul class='tnav'>
