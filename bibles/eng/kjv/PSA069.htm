 <span class="verse" id="V1">1&nbsp;</span>Save me, O God; for the waters are come in unto <span class='add'>my</span> soul. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span>I sink in deep mire, where <span class='add'>there is</span> no standing: I am come into deep waters, where the floods overflow me. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>I am weary of my crying: my throat is dried: mine eyes fail while I wait for my God. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>They that hate me without a cause are more than the hairs of mine head: they that would destroy me, <span class='add'>being</span> mine enemies wrongfully, are mighty: then I restored <span class='add'>that</span> which I took not away. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>O God, thou knowest my foolishness; and my sins are not hid from thee. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>Let not them that wait on thee, O Lord GOD of hosts, be ashamed for my sake: let not those that seek thee be confounded for my sake, O God of Israel. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>Because for thy sake I have borne reproach; shame hath covered my face. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>I am become a stranger unto my brethren, and an alien unto my mother’s children. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>For the zeal of thine house hath eaten me up; and the reproaches of them that reproached thee are fallen upon me. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>When I wept, <span class='add'>and chastened</span> my soul with fasting, that was to my reproach. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>I made sackcloth also my garment; and I became a proverb to them. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>They that sit in the gate speak against me; and I <span class='add'>was</span> the song of the drunkards. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>But as for me, my prayer <span class='add'>is</span> unto thee, O LORD, <span class='add'>in</span> an acceptable time: O God, in the multitude of thy mercy hear me, in the truth of thy salvation. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>Deliver me out of the mire, and let me not sink: let me be delivered from them that hate me, and out of the deep waters. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>Let not the waterflood overflow me, neither let the deep swallow me up, and let not the pit shut her mouth upon me. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>Hear me, O LORD; for thy lovingkindness <span class='add'>is</span> good: turn unto me according to the multitude of thy tender mercies. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>And hide not thy face from thy servant; for I am in trouble: hear me speedily. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>Draw nigh unto my soul, <span class='add'>and</span> redeem it: deliver me because of mine enemies. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>Thou hast known my reproach, and my shame, and my dishonour: mine adversaries <span class='add'>are</span> all before thee. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>Reproach hath broken my heart; and I am full of heaviness: and I looked <span class='add'>for some</span> to take pity, but <span class='add'>there was</span> none; and for comforters, but I found none. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>They gave me also gall for my meat;
