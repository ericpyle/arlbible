 <span class="verse" id="V1">1&nbsp;</span>The word of the LORD that came to Jeremiah concerning the dearth.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span>Judah mourneth, and the gates thereof languish; they are black unto the ground; and the cry of Jerusalem is gone up.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>And their nobles have sent their little ones to the waters: they came to the pits, <span class='add'>and</span> found no water; they returned with their vessels empty; they were ashamed and confounded, and covered their heads.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>Because the ground is chapt, for there was no rain in the earth, the plowmen were ashamed, they covered their heads.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>Yea, the hind also calved in the field, and forsook <span class='add'>it</span>, because there was no grass.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>And the wild asses did stand in the high places, they snuffed up the wind like dragons; their eyes did fail, because <span class='add'>there was</span> no grass. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>O LORD, though our iniquities testify against us, do thou <span class='add'>it</span> for thy name’s sake: for our backslidings are many; we have sinned against thee.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>O the hope of Israel, the saviour thereof in time of trouble, why shouldest thou be as a stranger in the land, and as a wayfaring man <span class='add'>that</span> turneth aside to tarry for a night?  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>Why shouldest thou be as a man astonied, as a mighty man <span class='add'>that</span> cannot save? yet thou, O LORD, <span class='add'>art</span> in the midst of us, and we are called by thy name; leave us not. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>Thus saith the LORD unto this people, Thus have they loved to wander, they have not refrained their feet, therefore the LORD doth not accept them; he will now remember their iniquity, and visit their sins.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>Then said the LORD unto me, Pray not for this people for <span class='add'>their</span> good.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>When they fast, I will not hear their cry; and when they offer burnt offering and an oblation, I will not accept them: but I will consume them by the sword, and by the famine, and by the pestilence. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>Then said I, Ah, Lord GOD! behold, the prophets say unto them, Ye shall not see the sword, neither shall ye have famine; but I will give you assured peace in this place.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>Then the LORD said unto me, The prophets prophesy lies in my name: I sent them not, neither have I commanded them, neither spake unto them: they prophesy unto you a false vision and divination, and a thing of nought, and the deceit of their heart.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>Therefore thus saith the LORD concerning the prophets that prophesy in my name, and I sent them not, yet they say, Sword and famine shall not be in this land; By sword and famine shall those prophets be consumed.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>And the people to whom they prophesy shall be cast out in the streets of Jerusalem because of the famine and the sword; and they shall have none to bury them, them, their wives, nor their sons, nor their daughters: for I will pour their wickedness upon them. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>Therefore thou shalt say this word unto them; Let mine eyes run down with tears night and day, and let them not cease: for the virgin daughter of my people is broken with a great breach, with a very grievous blow.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>If I go forth into the field, then behold the slain with the sword! and if I enter into the city, then behold them that are sick with famine! yea, both the prophet and the priest go about into a land that they know not.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>Hast thou utterly rejected Judah? hath thy soul lothed Zion? why hast thou smitten us, and <span class='add'>there is</span> no healing for us? we looked for peace, and <span class='add'>there is</span> no good; and for the time of healing, and behold trouble!  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>We acknowledge, O LORD, our wickedness, <span class='add'>and</span> the iniquity of our fathers: for we have sinned against thee.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>Do not abhor <span class='add'>us</span>, for thy name’s sake, do not disgrace the throne of thy glory: remember, break not thy covenant with us.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>Are there <span class='add'>any</span> among the vanities of the Gentiles that can cause rain? or can the heavens give showers? <span class='add'>art</span> not thou he, O LORD our God? therefore we will wait upon thee: for thou hast made all these <span class='add'>things</span>. </div><ul class='tnav'>
