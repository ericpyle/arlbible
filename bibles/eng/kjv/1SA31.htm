 <span class="verse" id="V1">1&nbsp;</span>Now the Philistines fought against Israel: and the men of Israel fled from before the Philistines, and fell down slain in mount Gilboa.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span>And the Philistines followed hard upon Saul and upon his sons; and the Philistines slew Jonathan, and Abinadab, and Melchi-shua, Saul’s sons.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>And the battle went sore against Saul, and the archers hit him; and he was sore wounded of the archers.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>Then said Saul unto his armourbearer, Draw thy sword, and thrust me through therewith; lest these uncircumcised come and thrust me through, and abuse me. But his armourbearer would not; for he was sore afraid. Therefore Saul took a sword, and fell upon it.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>And when his armourbearer saw that Saul was dead, he fell likewise upon his sword, and died with him.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>So Saul died, and his three sons, and his armourbearer, and all his men, that same day together. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>And when the men of Israel that <span class='add'>were</span> on the other side of the valley, and <span class='add'>they</span> that <span class='add'>were</span> on the other side Jordan, saw that the men of Israel fled, and that Saul and his sons were dead, they forsook the cities, and fled; and the Philistines came and dwelt in them.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>And it came to pass on the morrow, when the Philistines came to strip the slain, that they found Saul and his three sons fallen in mount Gilboa.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>And they cut off his head, and stripped off his armour, and sent into the land of the Philistines round about, to publish <span class='add'>it in</span> the house of their idols, and among the people.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>And they put his armour in the house of Ashtaroth: and they fastened his body to the wall of Beth-shan. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>And when the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead heard of that which the Philistines had done to Saul;  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>All the valiant men arose, and went all night, and took the body of Saul and the bodies of his sons from the wall of Beth-shan, and came to Jabesh, and burnt them there.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>And they took their bones, and buried <span class='add'>them</span> under a tree at Jabesh, and fasted seven days. </div><ul class='tnav'>
