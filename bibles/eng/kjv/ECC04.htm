 <span class="verse" id="V1">1&nbsp;</span>So I returned, and considered all the oppressions that are done under the sun: and behold the tears of <span class='add'>such as were</span> oppressed, and they had no comforter; and on the side of their oppressors <span class='add'>there was</span> power; but they had no comforter.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span>Wherefore I praised the dead which are already dead more than the living which are yet alive.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>Yea, better <span class='add'>is he</span> than both they, which hath not yet been, who hath not seen the evil work that is done under the sun. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>Again, I considered all travail, and every right work, that for this a man is envied of his neighbour.
