 <span class="verse" id="V1">1&nbsp;</span> After these things Paul departed from Athens, and came to Corinth;  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span> And found a certain Jew named Aquila, born in Pontus, lately come from Italy, with his wife Priscilla; (because that Claudius had commanded all Jews to depart from Rome:) and came unto them.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span> And because he was of the same craft, he abode with them, and wrought: for by their occupation they were tentmakers.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span> And he reasoned in the synagogue every sabbath, and persuaded the Jews and the Greeks.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span> And when Silas and Timotheus were come from Macedonia, Paul was pressed in the spirit, and testified to the Jews <span class='add'>that</span> Jesus <span class='add'>was</span> Christ.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span> And when they opposed themselves, and blasphemed, he shook <span class='add'>his</span> raiment, and said unto them, Your blood <span class='add'>be</span> upon your own heads; I <span class='add'>am</span> clean: from henceforth I will go unto the Gentiles. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>¶ And he departed thence, and entered into a certain <span class='add'>man’s</span> house, named Justus, <span class='add'>one</span> that worshipped God, whose house joined hard to the synagogue.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span> And Crispus, the chief ruler of the synagogue, believed on the Lord with all his house; and many of the Corinthians hearing believed, and were baptized.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span> Then spake the Lord to Paul in the night by a vision, <span class='wj'> Be not afraid, but speak, and hold not thy peace:</span>  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'> For I am with thee, and no man shall set on thee to hurt thee: for I have much people in this city.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span> And he continued <span class='add'>there</span> a year and six months, teaching the word of God among them. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>¶ And when Gallio was the deputy of Achaia, the Jews made insurrection with one accord against Paul, and brought him to the judgment seat,  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span> Saying, This <span class='add'>fellow</span> persuadeth men to worship God contrary to the law.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span> And when Paul was now about to open <span class='add'>his</span> mouth, Gallio said unto the Jews, If it were a matter of wrong or wicked lewdness, O <span class='add'>ye</span> Jews, reason would that I should bear with you:  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span> But if it be a question of words and names, and <span class='add'>of</span> your law, look ye <span class='add'>to it</span>; for I will be no judge of such <span class='add'>matters</span>.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span> And he drave them from the judgment seat.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span> Then all the Greeks took Sosthenes, the chief ruler of the synagogue, and beat <span class='add'>him</span> before the judgment seat. And Gallio cared for none of those things. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>¶ And Paul <span class='add'>after this</span> tarried <span class='add'>there</span> yet a good while, and then took his leave of the brethren, and sailed thence into Syria, and with him Priscilla and Aquila; having shorn <span class='add'>his</span> head in Cenchrea: for he had a vow.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span> And he came to Ephesus, and left them there: but he himself entered into the synagogue, and reasoned with the Jews.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span> When they desired <span class='add'>him</span> to tarry longer time with them, he consented not;  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span> But bade them farewell, saying, I must by all means keep this feast that cometh in Jerusalem: but I will return again unto you, if God will. And he sailed from Ephesus.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span> And when he had landed at Cæsarea, and gone up, and saluted the church, he went down to Antioch.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span> And after he had spent some time <span class='add'>there</span>, he departed, and went over <span class='add'>all</span> the country of Galatia and Phrygia in order, strengthening all the disciples. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>¶ And a certain Jew named Apollos, born at Alexandria, an eloquent man, <span class='add'>and</span> mighty in the scriptures, came to Ephesus.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span> This man was instructed in the way of the Lord; and being fervent in the spirit, he spake and taught diligently the things of the Lord, knowing only the baptism of John.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span> And he began to speak boldly in the synagogue: whom when Aquila and Priscilla had heard, they took him unto <span class='add'>them</span>, and expounded unto him the way of God more perfectly.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span> And when he was disposed to pass into Achaia, the brethren wrote, exhorting the disciples to receive him: who, when he was come, helped them much which had believed through grace:  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&nbsp;</span> For he mightily convinced the Jews, <span class='add'>and that</span> publickly, shewing by the scriptures that Jesus was Christ. </div><ul class='tnav'>
