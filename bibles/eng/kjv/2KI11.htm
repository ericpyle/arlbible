 <span class="verse" id="V1">1&nbsp;</span>And when Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was dead, she arose and destroyed all the seed royal.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span>But Jehosheba, the daughter of king Joram, sister of Ahaziah, took Joash the son of Ahaziah and stole him from among the king’s sons <span class='add'>which were</span> slain; and they hid him, <span class='add'>even</span> him and his nurse, in the bedchamber from Athaliah, so that he was not slain.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>And he was with her hid in the house of the LORD six years.
