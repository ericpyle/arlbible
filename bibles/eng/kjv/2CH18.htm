 <span class="verse" id="V1">1&nbsp;</span>Now Jehoshaphat had riches and honour in abundance, and joined affinity with Ahab.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span>And after <span class='add'>certain</span> years he went down to Ahab to Samaria. And Ahab killed sheep and oxen for him in abundance, and for the people that <span class='add'>he had</span> with him, and persuaded him to go up <span class='add'>with him</span> to Ramoth-gilead.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>And Ahab king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat king of Judah, Wilt thou go with me to Ramoth-gilead? And he answered him, I <span class='add'>am</span> as thou <span class='add'>art</span>, and my people as thy people; and <span class='add'>we will be</span> with thee in the war. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>And Jehoshaphat said unto the king of Israel, Enquire, I pray thee, at the word of the LORD to day.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>Therefore the king of Israel gathered together of prophets four hundred men, and said unto them, Shall we go to Ramoth-gilead to battle, or shall I forbear? And they said, Go up; for God will deliver <span class='add'>it</span> into the king’s hand.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>But Jehoshaphat said, <span class='add'>Is there</span> not here a prophet of the LORD besides, that we might enquire of him?  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, <span class='add'>There is</span> yet one man, by whom we may enquire of the LORD: but I hate him; for he never prophesied good unto me, but always evil: the same is Micaiah the son of Imla. And Jehoshaphat said, Let not the king say so.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>And the king of Israel called for one <span class='add'>of his</span> officers, and said, Fetch quickly Micaiah the son of Imla.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>And the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat king of Judah sat either of them on his throne, clothed in <span class='add'>their</span> robes, and they sat in a void place at the entering in of the gate of Samaria; and all the prophets prophesied before them.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>And Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah had made him horns of iron, and said, Thus saith the LORD, With these thou shalt push Syria until they be consumed.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>And all the prophets prophesied so, saying, Go up to Ramoth-gilead, and prosper: for the LORD shall deliver <span class='add'>it</span> into the hand of the king.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>And the messenger that went to call Micaiah spake to him, saying, Behold, the words of the prophets <span class='add'>declare</span> good to the king with one assent; let thy word therefore, I pray thee, be like one of theirs, and speak thou good.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>And Micaiah said, <span class='add'>As</span> the LORD liveth, even what my God saith, that will I speak.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>And when he was come to the king, the king said unto him, Micaiah, shall we go to Ramoth-gilead to battle, or shall I forbear? And he said, Go ye up, and prosper, and they shall be delivered into your hand.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>And the king said to him, How many times shall I adjure thee that thou say nothing but the truth to me in the name of the LORD?  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>Then he said, I did see all Israel scattered upon the mountains, as sheep that have no shepherd: and the LORD said, These have no master; let them return <span class='add'>therefore</span> every man to his house in peace.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, Did I not tell thee <span class='add'>that</span> he would not prophesy good unto me, but evil?  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>Again he said, Therefore hear the word of the LORD; I saw the LORD sitting upon his throne, and all the host of heaven standing on his right hand and <span class='add'>on</span> his left.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>And the LORD said, Who shall entice Ahab king of Israel, that he may go up and fall at Ramoth-gilead? And one spake saying after this manner, and another saying after that manner.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>Then there came out a spirit, and stood before the LORD, and said, I will entice him. And the LORD said unto him, Wherewith?  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>And he said, I will go out, and be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets. And <span class='add'>the LORD</span> said, Thou shalt entice <span class='add'>him</span>, and thou shalt also prevail: go out, and do <span class='add'>even</span> so.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>Now therefore, behold, the LORD hath put a lying spirit in the mouth of these thy prophets, and the LORD hath spoken evil against thee.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>Then Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah came near, and smote Micaiah upon the cheek, and said, Which way went the Spirit of the LORD from me to speak unto thee?  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>And Micaiah said, Behold, thou shalt see on that day when thou shalt go into an inner chamber to hide thyself.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>Then the king of Israel said, Take ye Micaiah, and carry him back to Amon the governor of the city, and to Joash the king’s son;  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>And say, Thus saith the king, Put this <span class='add'>fellow</span> in the prison, and feed him with bread of affliction and with water of affliction, until I return in peace.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>And Micaiah said, If thou certainly return in peace, <span class='add'>then</span> hath not the LORD spoken by me. And he said, Hearken, all ye people.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&nbsp;</span>So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went up to Ramoth-gilead.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&nbsp;</span>And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, I will disguise myself, and will go to the battle; but put thou on thy robes. So the king of Israel disguised himself; and they went to the battle.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&nbsp;</span>Now the king of Syria had commanded the captains of the chariots that <span class='add'>were</span> with him, saying, Fight ye not with small or great, save only with the king of Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&nbsp;</span>And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat, that they said, It <span class='add'>is</span> the king of Israel. Therefore they compassed about him to fight: but Jehoshaphat cried out, and the LORD helped him; and God moved them <span class='add'>to depart</span> from him.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&nbsp;</span>For it came to pass, that, when the captains of the chariots perceived that it was not the king of Israel, they turned back again from pursuing him.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&nbsp;</span>And a <span class='add'>certain</span> man drew a bow at a venture, and smote the king of Israel between the joints of the harness: therefore he said to his chariot man, Turn thine hand, that thou mayest carry me out of the host; for I am wounded.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&nbsp;</span>And the battle increased that day: howbeit the king of Israel stayed <span class='add'>himself</span> up in <span class='add'>his</span> chariot against the Syrians until the even: and about the time of the sun going down he died. </div><ul class='tnav'>
