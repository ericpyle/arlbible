 <span class="verse" id="V1">1&nbsp;</span>The burden of the word of the LORD to Israel by Malachi.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span>I have loved you, saith the LORD. Yet ye say, Wherein hast thou loved us? <span class='add'>Was</span> not Esau Jacob’s brother? saith the LORD: yet I loved Jacob,  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>And I hated Esau, and laid his mountains and his heritage waste for the dragons of the wilderness.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>Whereas Edom saith, We are impoverished, but we will return and build the desolate places; thus saith the LORD of hosts, They shall build, but I will throw down; and they shall call them, The border of wickedness, and, The people against whom the LORD hath indignation for ever.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>And your eyes shall see, and ye shall say, The LORD will be magnified from the border of Israel. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>A son honoureth <span class='add'>his</span> father, and a servant his master: if then I <span class='add'>be</span> a father, where <span class='add'>is</span> mine honour? and if I <span class='add'>be</span> a master, where <span class='add'>is</span> my fear? saith the LORD of hosts unto you, O priests, that despise my name. And ye say, Wherein have we despised thy name?  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>Ye offer polluted bread upon mine altar; and ye say, Wherein have we polluted thee? In that ye say, The table of the LORD <span class='add'>is</span> contemptible.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>And if ye offer the blind for sacrifice, <span class='add'>is it</span> not evil? and if ye offer the lame and sick, <span class='add'>is it</span> not evil? offer it now unto thy governor; will he be pleased with thee, or accept thy person? saith the LORD of hosts.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>And now, I pray you, beseech God that he will be gracious unto us: this hath been by your means: will he regard your persons? saith the LORD of hosts.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>Who <span class='add'>is there</span> even among you that would shut the doors <span class='add'>for nought?</span> neither do ye kindle <span class='add'>fire</span> on mine altar for nought. I have no pleasure in you, saith the LORD of hosts, neither will I accept an offering at your hand.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>For from the rising of the sun even unto the going down of the same my name <span class='add'>shall be</span> great among the Gentiles; and in every place incense <span class='add'>shall be</span> offered unto my name, and a pure offering: for my name <span class='add'>shall be</span> great among the heathen, saith the LORD of hosts. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>But ye have profaned it, in that ye say, The table of the LORD <span class='add'>is</span> polluted; and the fruit thereof, <span class='add'>even</span> his meat, <span class='add'>is</span> contemptible.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>Ye said also, Behold, what a weariness <span class='add'>is it!</span> and ye have snuffed at it, saith the LORD of hosts; and ye brought <span class='add'>that which was</span> torn, and the lame, and the sick; thus ye brought an offering: should I accept this of your hand? saith the LORD.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>But cursed <span class='add'>be</span> the deceiver, which hath in his flock a male, and voweth, and sacrificeth unto the Lord a corrupt thing: for I <span class='add'>am</span> a great King, saith the LORD of hosts, and my name <span class='add'>is</span> dreadful among the heathen. </div><ul class='tnav'>
