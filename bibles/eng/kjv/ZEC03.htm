 <span class="verse" id="V1">1&nbsp;</span>And he shewed me Joshua the high priest standing before the angel of the LORD, and Satan standing at his right hand to resist him.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span>And the LORD said unto Satan, The LORD rebuke thee, O Satan; even the LORD that hath chosen Jerusalem rebuke thee: <span class='add'>is</span> not this a brand plucked out of the fire?  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>Now Joshua was clothed with filthy garments, and stood before the angel.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>And he answered and spake unto those that stood before him, saying, Take away the filthy garments from him. And unto him he said, Behold, I have caused thine iniquity to pass from thee, and I will clothe thee with change of raiment.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>And I said, Let them set a fair mitre upon his head. So they set a fair mitre upon his head, and clothed him with garments. And the angel of the LORD stood by.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>And the angel of the LORD protested unto Joshua, saying,  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>Thus saith the LORD of hosts; If thou wilt walk in my ways, and if thou wilt keep my charge, then thou shalt also judge my house, and shalt also keep my courts, and I will give thee places to walk among these that stand by.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>Hear now, O Joshua the high priest, thou, and thy fellows that sit before thee: for they <span class='add'>are</span> men wondered at: for, behold, I will bring forth my servant the BRANCH.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>For behold the stone that I have laid before Joshua; upon one stone <span class='add'>shall be</span> seven eyes: behold, I will engrave the graving thereof, saith the LORD of hosts, and I will remove the iniquity of that land in one day.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>In that day, saith the LORD of hosts, shall ye call every man his neighbour under the vine and under the fig tree. </div><ul class='tnav'>
