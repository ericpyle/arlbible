Behold, in the day of your fast ye find pleasure, and exact all your labours.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>Behold, ye fast for strife and debate, and to smite with the fist of wickedness: ye shall not fast as <span class='add'>ye do this</span> day, to make your voice to be heard on high.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>Is it such a fast that I have chosen? a day for a man to afflict his soul? <span class='add'>is it</span> to bow down his head as a bulrush, and to spread sackcloth and ashes <span class='add'>under him?</span> wilt thou call this a fast, and an acceptable day to the LORD?  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span> <span class='add'>Is</span> not this the fast that I have chosen? to loose the bands of wickedness, to undo the heavy burdens, and to let the oppressed go free, and that ye break every yoke?  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span> <span class='add'>Is it</span> not to deal thy bread to the hungry, and that thou bring the poor that are cast out to thy house? when thou seest the naked, that thou cover him; and that thou hide not thyself from thine own flesh? </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>Then shall thy light break forth as the morning, and thine health shall spring forth speedily: and thy righteousness shall go before thee; the glory of the LORD shall be thy rereward.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>Then shalt thou call, and the LORD shall answer; thou shalt cry, and he shall say, Here I <span class='add'>am</span>.
