 <span class="verse" id="V1">1&nbsp;</span>So they brought the ark of God, and set it in the midst of the tent that David had pitched for it: and they offered burnt sacrifices and peace offerings before God.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span>And when David had made an end of offering the burnt offerings and the peace offerings, he blessed the people in the name of the LORD.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>And he dealt to every one of Israel, both man and woman, to every one a loaf of bread, and a good piece of flesh, and a flagon <span class='add'>of wine</span>. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>And he appointed <span class='add'>certain</span> of the Levites to minister before the ark of the LORD, and to record, and to thank and praise the LORD God of Israel:  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>Asaph the chief, and next to him Zechariah, Jeiel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Mattithiah, and Eliab, and Benaiah, and Obed-edom: and Jeiel with psalteries and with harps; but Asaph made a sound with cymbals;  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>Benaiah also and Jahaziel the priests with trumpets continually before the ark of the covenant of God. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>Then on that day David delivered first <span class='add'>this psalm</span> to thank the LORD into the hand of Asaph and his brethren.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>Give thanks unto the LORD, call upon his name, make known his deeds among the people.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>Sing unto him, sing psalms unto him, talk ye of all his wondrous works.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>Glory ye in his holy name: let the heart of them rejoice that seek the LORD.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>Seek the LORD and his strength, seek his face continually.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>Remember his marvellous works that he hath done, his wonders, and the judgments of his mouth;
