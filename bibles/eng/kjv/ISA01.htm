 <span class="verse" id="V1">1&nbsp;</span>The vision of Isaiah the son of Amoz, which he saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, <span class='add'>and</span> Hezekiah, kings of Judah.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span>Hear, O heavens, and give ear, O earth: for the LORD hath spoken, I have nourished and brought up children, and they have rebelled against me.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>The ox knoweth his owner, and the ass his master’s crib: <span class='add'>but</span> Israel doth not know, my people doth not consider.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>Ah sinful nation, a people laden with iniquity, a seed of evildoers, children that are corrupters: they have forsaken the LORD, they have provoked the Holy One of Israel unto anger, they are gone away backward. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>Why should ye be stricken any more? ye will revolt more and more: the whole head is sick, and the whole heart faint.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>From the sole of the foot even unto the head <span class='add'>there is</span> no soundness in it; <span class='add'>but</span> wounds, and bruises, and putrifying sores: they have not been closed, neither bound up, neither mollified with ointment.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>Your country <span class='add'>is</span> desolate, your cities <span class='add'>are</span> burned with fire: your land, strangers devour it in your presence, and <span class='add'>it is</span> desolate, as overthrown by strangers.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>And the daughter of Zion is left as a cottage in a vineyard, as a lodge in a garden of cucumbers, as a besieged city.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>Except the LORD of hosts had left unto us a very small remnant, we should have been as Sodom, <span class='add'>and</span> we should have been like unto Gomorrah. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>Hear the word of the LORD, ye rulers of Sodom; give ear unto the law of our God, ye people of Gomorrah.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>To what purpose <span class='add'>is</span> the multitude of your sacrifices unto me? saith the LORD: I am full of the burnt offerings of rams, and the fat of fed beasts; and I delight not in the blood of bullocks, or of lambs, or of he goats.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>When ye come to appear before me, who hath required this at your hand, to tread my courts?  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>Bring no more vain oblations; incense is an abomination unto me; the new moons and sabbaths, the calling of assemblies, I cannot away with; <span class='add'>it is</span> iniquity, even the solemn meeting.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>Your new moons and your appointed feasts my soul hateth: they are a trouble unto me; I am weary to bear <span class='add'>them</span>.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>And when ye spread forth your hands, I will hide mine eyes from you: yea, when ye make many prayers, I will not hear: your hands are full of blood. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>Wash you, make you clean; put away the evil of your doings from before mine eyes; cease to do evil;  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>Learn to do well; seek judgment, relieve the oppressed, judge the fatherless, plead for the widow.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>Come now, and let us reason together, saith the LORD: though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>If ye be willing and obedient, ye shall eat the good of the land:  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>But if ye refuse and rebel, ye shall be devoured with the sword: for the mouth of the LORD hath spoken <span class='add'>it</span>. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>How is the faithful city become an harlot! it was full of judgment; righteousness lodged in it; but now murderers.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>Thy silver is become dross, thy wine mixed with water:  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>Thy princes <span class='add'>are</span> rebellious, and companions of thieves: every one loveth gifts, and followeth after rewards: they judge not the fatherless, neither doth the cause of the widow come unto them.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>Therefore saith the Lord, the LORD of hosts, the mighty One of Israel, Ah, I will ease me of mine adversaries, and avenge me of mine enemies: </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>And I will turn my hand upon thee, and purely purge away thy dross, and take away all thy tin:  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>And I will restore thy judges as at the first, and thy counsellors as at the beginning: afterward thou shalt be called, The city of righteousness, the faithful city.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>Zion shall be redeemed with judgment, and her converts with righteousness. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V28">28&nbsp;</span>And the destruction of the transgressors and of the sinners <span class='add'>shall be</span> together, and they that forsake the LORD shall be consumed.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&nbsp;</span>For they shall be ashamed of the oaks which ye have desired, and ye shall be confounded for the gardens that ye have chosen.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&nbsp;</span>For ye shall be as an oak whose leaf fadeth, and as a garden that hath no water.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&nbsp;</span>And the strong shall be as tow, and the maker of it as a spark, and they shall both burn together, and none shall quench <span class='add'>them</span>. </div><ul class='tnav'>
