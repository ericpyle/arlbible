 <span class="verse" id="V1">1&nbsp;</span>Then he brought me forth into the utter court, the way toward the north: and he brought me into the chamber that <span class='add'>was</span> over against the separate place, and which <span class='add'>was</span> before the building toward the north.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span>Before the length of an hundred cubits <span class='add'>was</span> the north door, and the breadth <span class='add'>was</span> fifty cubits.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>Over against the twenty <span class='add'>cubits</span> which <span class='add'>were</span> for the inner court, and over against the pavement which <span class='add'>was</span> for the utter court, <span class='add'>was</span> gallery against gallery in three <span class='add'>stories</span>.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>And before the chambers <span class='add'>was</span> a walk of ten cubits breadth inward, a way of one cubit; and their doors toward the north.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>Now the upper chambers <span class='add'>were</span> shorter: for the galleries were higher than these, than the lower, and than the middlemost of the building.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>For they <span class='add'>were</span> in three <span class='add'>stories</span>, but had not pillars as the pillars of the courts: therefore <span class='add'>the building</span> was straitened more than the lowest and the middlemost from the ground.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>And the wall that <span class='add'>was</span> without over against the chambers, toward the utter court on the forepart of the chambers, the length thereof <span class='add'>was</span> fifty cubits.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>For the length of the chambers that <span class='add'>were</span> in the utter court <span class='add'>was</span> fifty cubits: and, lo, before the temple <span class='add'>were</span> an hundred cubits.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>And from under these chambers <span class='add'>was</span> the entry on the east side, as one goeth into them from the utter court.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>The chambers <span class='add'>were</span> in the thickness of the wall of the court toward the east, over against the separate place, and over against the building.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>And the way before them <span class='add'>was</span> like the appearance of the chambers which <span class='add'>were</span> toward the north, as long as they, <span class='add'>and</span> as broad as they: and all their goings out <span class='add'>were</span> both according to their fashions, and according to their doors.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>And according to the doors of the chambers that <span class='add'>were</span> toward the south <span class='add'>was</span> a door in the head of the way, <span class='add'>even</span> the way directly before the wall toward the east, as one entereth into them. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>Then said he unto me, The north chambers <span class='add'>and</span> the south chambers, which <span class='add'>are</span> before the separate place, they <span class='add'>be</span> holy chambers, where the priests that approach unto the LORD shall eat the most holy things: there shall they lay the most holy things, and the meat offering, and the sin offering, and the trespass offering; for the place <span class='add'>is</span> holy.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>When the priests enter therein, then shall they not go out of the holy <span class='add'>place</span> into the utter court, but there they shall lay their garments wherein they minister; for they <span class='add'>are</span> holy; and shall put on other garments, and shall approach to <span class='add'>those things</span> which <span class='add'>are</span> for the people.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>Now when he had made an end of measuring the inner house, he brought me forth toward the gate whose prospect <span class='add'>is</span> toward the east, and measured it round about.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>He measured the east side with the measuring reed, five hundred reeds, with the measuring reed round about.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>He measured the north side, five hundred reeds, with the measuring reed round about.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>He measured the south side, five hundred reeds, with the measuring reed. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>He turned about to the west side, <span class='add'>and</span> measured five hundred reeds with the measuring reed.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>He measured it by the four sides: it had a wall round about, five hundred <span class='add'>reeds</span> long, and five hundred broad, to make a separation between the sanctuary and the profane place. </div><ul class='tnav'>
