 <span class="verse" id="V1">1&nbsp;</span>A good name <span class='add'>is</span> better than precious ointment; and the day of death than the day of one’s birth. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span> <span class='add'>It is</span> better to go to the house of mourning, than to go to the house of feasting: for that is the end of all men; and the living will lay <span class='add'>it</span> to his heart.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>Sorrow <span class='add'>is</span> better than laughter: for by the sadness of the countenance the heart is made better.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>The heart of the wise <span class='add'>is</span> in the house of mourning; but the heart of fools <span class='add'>is</span> in the house of mirth.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span> <span class='add'>It is</span> better to hear the rebuke of the wise, than for a man to hear the song of fools.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>For as the crackling of thorns under a pot, so <span class='add'>is</span> the laughter of the fool: this also <span class='add'>is</span> vanity. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>Surely oppression maketh a wise man mad; and a gift destroyeth the heart.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>Better <span class='add'>is</span> the end of a thing than the beginning thereof: <span class='add'>and</span> the patient in spirit <span class='add'>is</span> better than the proud in spirit.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>Be not hasty in thy spirit to be angry: for anger resteth in the bosom of fools.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>Say not thou, What is <span class='add'>the cause</span> that the former days were better than these? for thou dost not enquire wisely concerning this. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>Wisdom <span class='add'>is</span> good with an inheritance: and <span class='add'>by it there is</span> profit to them that see the sun.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>For wisdom <span class='add'>is</span> a defence, <span class='add'>and</span> money <span class='add'>is</span> a defence: but the excellency of knowledge <span class='add'>is, that</span> wisdom giveth life to them that have it.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>Consider the work of God: for who can make <span class='add'>that</span> straight, which he hath made crooked?  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>In the day of prosperity be joyful, but in the day of adversity consider: God also hath set the one over against the other, to the end that man should find nothing after him.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>All <span class='add'>things</span> have I seen in the days of my vanity: there is a just <span class='add'>man</span> that perisheth in his righteousness, and there is a wicked <span class='add'>man</span> that prolongeth <span class='add'>his life</span> in his wickedness.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>Be not righteous over much; neither make thyself over wise: why shouldest thou destroy thyself?  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>Be not over much wicked, neither be thou foolish: why shouldest thou die before thy time?  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span> <span class='add'>It is</span> good that thou shouldest take hold of this; yea, also from this withdraw not thine hand: for he that feareth God shall come forth of them all.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>Wisdom strengtheneth the wise more than ten mighty <span class='add'>men</span> which are in the city.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>For <span class='add'>there is</span> not a just man upon earth, that doeth good, and sinneth not.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>Also take no heed unto all words that are spoken; lest thou hear thy servant curse thee:  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>For oftentimes also thine own heart knoweth that thou thyself likewise hast cursed others. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>All this have I proved by wisdom: I said, I will be wise; but it <span class='add'>was</span> far from me.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>That which is far off, and exceeding deep, who can find it out?  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>I applied mine heart to know, and to search, and to seek out wisdom, and the reason <span class='add'>of things</span>, and to know the wickedness of folly, even of foolishness <span class='add'>and</span> madness:  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>And I find more bitter than death the woman, whose heart <span class='add'>is</span> snares and nets, <span class='add'>and</span> her hands <span class='add'>as</span> bands: whoso pleaseth God shall escape from her; but the sinner shall be taken by her.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>Behold, this have I found, saith the preacher, <span class='add'>counting</span> one by one, to find out the account:  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&nbsp;</span>Which yet my soul seeketh, but I find not: one man among a thousand have I found; but a woman among all those have I not found.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&nbsp;</span>Lo, this only have I found, that God hath made man upright; but they have sought out many inventions. </div><ul class='tnav'>
