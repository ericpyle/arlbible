 <span class="verse" id="V1">1&nbsp;</span>As snow in summer, and as rain in harvest, so honour is not seemly for a fool.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span>As the bird by wandering, as the swallow by flying, so the curse causeless shall not come.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>A whip for the horse, a bridle for the ass, and a rod for the fool’s back.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>Answer not a fool according to his folly, lest thou also be like unto him.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>Answer a fool according to his folly, lest he be wise in his own conceit.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>He that sendeth a message by the hand of a fool cutteth off the feet, <span class='add'>and</span> drinketh damage.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>The legs of the lame are not equal: so <span class='add'>is</span> a parable in the mouth of fools.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>As he that bindeth a stone in a sling, so <span class='add'>is</span> he that giveth honour to a fool.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span> <span class='add'>As</span> a thorn goeth up into the hand of a drunkard, so <span class='add'>is</span> a parable in the mouth of fools.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>The great <span class='add'>God</span> that formed all <span class='add'>things</span> both rewardeth the fool, and rewardeth transgressors.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>As a dog returneth to his vomit, <span class='add'>so</span> a fool returneth to his folly.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>Seest thou a man wise in his own conceit? <span class='add'>there is</span> more hope of a fool than of him.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>The slothful <span class='add'>man</span> saith, <span class='add'>There is</span> a lion in the way; a lion <span class='add'>is</span> in the streets.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span> <span class='add'>As</span> the door turneth upon his hinges, so <span class='add'>doth</span> the slothful upon his bed.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>The slothful hideth his hand in <span class='add'>his</span> bosom; it grieveth him to bring it again to his mouth.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>The sluggard <span class='add'>is</span> wiser in his own conceit than seven men that can render a reason.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>He that passeth by, <span class='add'>and</span> meddleth with strife <span class='add'>belonging</span> not to him, <span class='add'>is like</span> one that taketh a dog by the ears.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>As a mad <span class='add'>man</span> who casteth firebrands, arrows, and death,  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>So <span class='add'>is</span> the man <span class='add'>that</span> deceiveth his neighbour, and saith, Am not I in sport?  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>Where no wood is, <span class='add'>there</span> the fire goeth out: so where <span class='add'>there is</span> no talebearer, the strife ceaseth.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span> <span class='add'>As</span> coals <span class='add'>are</span> to burning coals, and wood to fire; so <span class='add'>is</span> a contentious man to kindle strife.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>The words of a talebearer <span class='add'>are</span> as wounds, and they go down into the innermost parts of the belly.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>Burning lips and a wicked heart <span class='add'>are like</span> a potsherd covered with silver dross.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>He that hateth dissembleth with his lips, and layeth up deceit within him;  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>When he speaketh fair, believe him not: for <span class='add'>there are</span> seven abominations in his heart.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span> <span class='add'>Whose</span> hatred is covered by deceit, his wickedness shall be shewed before the <span class='add'>whole</span> congregation.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>Whoso diggeth a pit shall fall therein: and he that rolleth a stone, it will return upon him.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&nbsp;</span>A lying tongue hateth <span class='add'>those that are</span> afflicted by it; and a flattering mouth worketh ruin. </div><ul class='tnav'>
