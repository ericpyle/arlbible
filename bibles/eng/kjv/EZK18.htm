The son shall not bear the iniquity of the father, neither shall the father bear the iniquity of the son: the righteousness of the righteous shall be upon him, and the wickedness of the wicked shall be upon him.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>But if the wicked will turn from all his sins that he hath committed, and keep all my statutes, and do that which is lawful and right, he shall surely live, he shall not die.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>All his transgressions that he hath committed, they shall not be mentioned unto him: in his righteousness that he hath done he shall live.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>Have I any pleasure at all that the wicked should die? saith the Lord GOD: <span class='add'>and</span> not that he should return from his ways, and live? </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>But when the righteous turneth away from his righteousness, and committeth iniquity, <span class='add'>and</span> doeth according to all the abominations that the wicked <span class='add'>man</span> doeth, shall he live?
