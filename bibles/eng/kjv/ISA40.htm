And he said, What shall I cry? All flesh <span class='add'>is</span> grass, and all the goodliness thereof <span class='add'>is</span> as the flower of the field:  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>The grass withereth, the flower fadeth: because the spirit of the LORD bloweth upon it: surely the people <span class='add'>is</span> grass.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>The grass withereth, the flower fadeth: but the word of our God shall stand for ever. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>O Zion, that bringest good tidings, get thee up into the high mountain; O Jerusalem, that bringest good tidings, lift up thy voice with strength; lift <span class='add'>it</span> up, be not afraid; say unto the cities of Judah, Behold your God!  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>Behold, the Lord GOD will come with strong <span class='add'>hand</span>, and his arm shall rule for him: behold, his reward <span class='add'>is</span> with him, and his work before him.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>He shall feed his flock like a shepherd: he shall gather the lambs with his arm, and carry <span class='add'>them</span> in his bosom, <span class='add'>and</span> shall gently lead those that are with young. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>Who hath measured the waters in the hollow of his hand, and meted out heaven with the span, and comprehended the dust of the earth in a measure, and weighed the mountains in scales, and the hills in a balance?  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>Who hath directed the Spirit of the LORD, or <span class='add'>being</span> his counsellor hath taught him?  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>With whom took he counsel, and <span class='add'>who</span> instructed him, and taught him in the path of judgment, and taught him knowledge, and shewed to him the way of understanding?  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>Behold, the nations <span class='add'>are</span> as a drop of a bucket, and are counted as the small dust of the balance: behold, he taketh up the isles as a very little thing.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>And Lebanon <span class='add'>is</span> not sufficient to burn, nor the beasts thereof sufficient for a burnt offering.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>All nations before him <span class='add'>are</span> as nothing; and they are counted to him less than nothing, and vanity. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>To whom then will ye liken God? or what likeness will ye compare unto him?  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>The workman melteth a graven image, and the goldsmith spreadeth it over with gold, and casteth silver chains.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>He that <span class='add'>is</span> so impoverished that he hath no oblation chooseth a tree <span class='add'>that</span> will not rot; he seeketh unto him a cunning workman to prepare a graven image, <span class='add'>that</span> shall not be moved.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>Have ye not known?
