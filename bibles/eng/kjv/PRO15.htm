 <span class="verse" id="V1">1&nbsp;</span>A soft answer turneth away wrath: but grievous words stir up anger.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span>The tongue of the wise useth knowledge aright: but the mouth of fools poureth out foolishness.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>The eyes of the LORD <span class='add'>are</span> in every place, beholding the evil and the good.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>A wholesome tongue <span class='add'>is</span> a tree of life: but perverseness therein <span class='add'>is</span> a breach in the spirit.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>A fool despiseth his father’s instruction: but he that regardeth reproof is prudent.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>In the house of the righteous <span class='add'>is</span> much treasure: but in the revenues of the wicked is trouble.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>The lips of the wise disperse knowledge: but the heart of the foolish <span class='add'>doeth</span> not so.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>The sacrifice of the wicked <span class='add'>is</span> an abomination to the LORD: but the prayer of the upright <span class='add'>is</span> his delight.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>The way of the wicked <span class='add'>is</span> an abomination unto the LORD: but he loveth him that followeth after righteousness.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>Correction <span class='add'>is</span> grievous unto him that forsaketh the way: <span class='add'>and</span> he that hateth reproof shall die.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>Hell and destruction <span class='add'>are</span> before the LORD: how much more then the hearts of the children of men?  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>A scorner loveth not one that reproveth him: neither will he go unto the wise.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>A merry heart maketh a cheerful countenance: but by sorrow of the heart the spirit is broken.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>The heart of him that hath understanding seeketh knowledge: but the mouth of fools feedeth on foolishness.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>All the days of the afflicted <span class='add'>are</span> evil: but he that is of a merry heart <span class='add'>hath</span> a continual feast.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>Better <span class='add'>is</span> little with the fear of the LORD than great treasure and trouble therewith.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>Better <span class='add'>is</span> a dinner of herbs where love is, than a stalled ox and hatred therewith.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>A wrathful man stirreth up strife: but <span class='add'>he that is</span> slow to anger appeaseth strife.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>The way of the slothful <span class='add'>man is</span> as an hedge of thorns: but the way of the righteous <span class='add'>is</span> made plain.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>A wise son maketh a glad father: but a foolish man despiseth his mother.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>Folly <span class='add'>is</span> joy to <span class='add'>him that is</span> destitute of wisdom: but a man of understanding walketh uprightly.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>Without counsel purposes are disappointed: but in the multitude of counsellors they are established.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>A man hath joy by the answer of his mouth: and a word <span class='add'>spoken</span> in due season, how good <span class='add'>is it!</span>  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>The way of life <span class='add'>is</span> above to the wise, that he may depart from hell beneath.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>The LORD will destroy the house of the proud: but he will establish the border of the widow.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>The thoughts of the wicked <span class='add'>are</span> an abomination to the LORD: but <span class='add'>the words</span> of the pure <span class='add'>are</span> pleasant words.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>He that is greedy of gain troubleth his own house; but he that hateth gifts shall live.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&nbsp;</span>The heart of the righteous studieth to answer: but the mouth of the wicked poureth out evil things.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&nbsp;</span>The LORD <span class='add'>is</span> far from the wicked: but he heareth the prayer of the righteous.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&nbsp;</span>The light of the eyes rejoiceth the heart: <span class='add'>and</span> a good report maketh the bones fat.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&nbsp;</span>The ear that heareth the reproof of life abideth among the wise.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&nbsp;</span>He that refuseth instruction despiseth his own soul: but he that heareth reproof getteth understanding.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&nbsp;</span>The fear of the LORD <span class='add'>is</span> the instruction of wisdom; and before honour <span class='add'>is</span> humility. </div><ul class='tnav'>
