 <span class="verse" id="V1">1&nbsp;</span>In the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah came Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon unto Jerusalem, and besieged it.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span>And the Lord gave Jehoiakim king of Judah into his hand, with part of the vessels of the house of God: which he carried into the land of Shinar to the house of his god; and he brought the vessels into the treasure house of his god. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>And the king spake unto Ashpenaz the master of his eunuchs, that he should bring <span class='add'>certain</span> of the children of Israel, and of the king’s seed, and of the princes;  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>Children in whom <span class='add'>was</span> no blemish, but well favoured, and skilful in all wisdom, and cunning in knowledge, and understanding science, and such as <span class='add'>had</span> ability in them to stand in the king’s palace, and whom they might teach the learning and the tongue of the Chaldeans.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>And the king appointed them a daily provision of the king’s meat, and of the wine which he drank: so nourishing them three years, that at the end thereof they might stand before the king.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>Now among these were of the children of Judah, Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah:  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>Unto whom the prince of the eunuchs gave names: for he gave unto Daniel <span class='add'>the name</span> of Belteshazzar; and to Hananiah, of Shadrach; and to Mishael, of Meshach; and to Azariah, of Abed-nego. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>But Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself with the portion of the king’s meat, nor with the wine which he drank: therefore he requested of the prince of the eunuchs that he might not defile himself.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>Now God had brought Daniel into favour and tender love with the prince of the eunuchs.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>And the prince of the eunuchs said unto Daniel, I fear my lord the king, who hath appointed your meat and your drink: for why should he see your faces worse liking than the children which <span class='add'>are</span> of your sort? then shall ye make <span class='add'>me</span> endanger my head to the king.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>Then said Daniel to Melzar, whom the prince of the eunuchs had set over Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah,  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>Prove thy servants, I beseech thee, ten days; and let them give us pulse to eat, and water to drink.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>Then let our countenances be looked upon before thee, and the countenance of the children that eat of the portion of the king’s meat: and as thou seest, deal with thy servants.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>So he consented to them in this matter, and proved them ten days.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>And at the end of ten days their countenances appeared fairer and fatter in flesh than all the children which did eat the portion of the king’s meat.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>Thus Melzar took away the portion of their meat, and the wine that they should drink; and gave them pulse. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>As for these four children, God gave them knowledge and skill in all learning and wisdom: and Daniel had understanding in all visions and dreams.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>Now at the end of the days that the king had said he should bring them in, then the prince of the eunuchs brought them in before Nebuchadnezzar.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>And the king communed with them; and among them all was found none like Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah: therefore stood they before the king.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>And in all matters of wisdom <span class='add'>and</span> understanding, that the king enquired of them, he found them ten times better than all the magicians <span class='add'>and</span> astrologers that <span class='add'>were</span> in all his realm.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>And Daniel continued <span class='add'>even</span> unto the first year of king Cyrus. </div><ul class='tnav'>
