 <span class="verse" id="V1">1&nbsp;</span> And I, brethren, could not speak unto you as unto spiritual, but as unto carnal, <span class='add'>even</span> as unto babes in Christ.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span> I have fed you with milk, and not with meat: for hitherto ye were not able <span class='add'>to bear it</span>, neither yet now are ye able. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span> For ye are yet carnal: for whereas <span class='add'>there is</span> among you envying, and strife, and divisions, are ye not carnal, and walk as men?  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span> For while one saith, I am of Paul; and another, I <span class='add'>am</span> of Apollos; are ye not carnal?  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span> Who then is Paul, and who <span class='add'>is</span> Apollos, but ministers by whom ye believed, even as the Lord gave to every man?  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span> I have planted, Apollos watered; but God gave the increase.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span> So then neither is he that planteth any thing, neither he that watereth; but God that giveth the increase.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span> Now he that planteth and he that watereth are one: and every man shall receive his own reward according to his own labour.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span> For we are labourers together with God: ye are God’s husbandry, <span class='add'>ye are</span> God’s building.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span> According to the grace of God which is given unto me, as a wise masterbuilder, I have laid the foundation, and another buildeth thereon. But let every man take heed how he buildeth thereupon.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span> For other foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which is Jesus Christ.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span> Now if any man build upon this foundation gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, stubble;  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span> Every man’s work shall be made manifest: for the day shall declare it, because it shall be revealed by fire; and the fire shall try every man’s work of what sort it is.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span> If any man’s work abide which he hath built thereupon, he shall receive a reward.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span> If any man’s work shall be burned, he shall suffer loss: but he himself shall be saved; yet so as by fire.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span> Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and <span class='add'>that</span> the Spirit of God dwelleth in you?  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span> If any man defile the temple of God, him shall God destroy; for the temple of God is holy, which <span class='add'>temple</span> ye are. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span> Let no man deceive himself. If any man among you seemeth to be wise in this world, let him become a fool, that he may be wise.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span> For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For it is written, He taketh the wise in their own craftiness.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span> And again, The Lord knoweth the thoughts of the wise, that they are vain.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span> Therefore let no man glory in men. For all things are yours;  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span> Whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come; all are yours;  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span> And ye are Christ’s; and Christ <span class='add'>is</span> God’s. </div><ul class='tnav'>
