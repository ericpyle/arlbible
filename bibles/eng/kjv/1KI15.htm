 <span class="verse" id="V1">1&nbsp;</span>Now in the eighteenth year of king Jeroboam the son of Nebat reigned Abijam over Judah.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span>Three years reigned he in Jerusalem. And his mother’s name <span class='add'>was</span> Maachah, the daughter of Abishalom.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>And he walked in all the sins of his father, which he had done before him: and his heart was not perfect with the LORD his God, as the heart of David his father.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>Nevertheless for David’s sake did the LORD his God give him a lamp in Jerusalem, to set up his son after him, and to establish Jerusalem:  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>Because David did <span class='add'>that which was</span> right in the eyes of the LORD, and turned not aside from any <span class='add'>thing</span> that he commanded him all the days of his life, save only in the matter of Uriah the Hittite.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>And there was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all the days of his life.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>Now the rest of the acts of Abijam, and all that he did, <span class='add'>are</span> they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? And there was war between Abijam and Jeroboam.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>And Abijam slept with his fathers; and they buried him in the city of David: and Asa his son reigned in his stead. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>And in the twentieth year of Jeroboam king of Israel reigned Asa over Judah.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>And forty and one years reigned he in Jerusalem. And his mother’s name <span class='add'>was</span> Maachah, the daughter of Abishalom.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>And Asa did <span class='add'>that which was</span> right in the eyes of the LORD, as <span class='add'>did</span> David his father.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>And he took away the sodomites out of the land, and removed all the idols that his fathers had made.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>And also Maachah his mother, even her he removed from <span class='add'>being</span> queen, because she had made an idol in a grove; and Asa destroyed her idol, and burnt <span class='add'>it</span> by the brook Kidron.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>But the high places were not removed: nevertheless Asa’s heart was perfect with the LORD all his days.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>And he brought in the things which his father had dedicated, and the things which himself had dedicated, into the house of the LORD, silver, and gold, and vessels. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>And there was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel all their days.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>And Baasha king of Israel went up against Judah, and built Ramah, that he might not suffer any to go out or come in to Asa king of Judah.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>Then Asa took all the silver and the gold <span class='add'>that were</span> left in the treasures of the house of the LORD, and the treasures of the king’s house, and delivered them into the hand of his servants: and king Asa sent them to Ben-hadad, the son of Tabrimon, the son of Hezion, king of Syria, that dwelt at Damascus, saying,  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span> <span class='add'>There is</span> a league between me and thee, <span class='add'>and</span> between my father and thy father: behold, I have sent unto thee a present of silver and gold; come and break thy league with Baasha king of Israel, that he may depart from me.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>So Ben-hadad hearkened unto king Asa, and sent the captains of the hosts which he had against the cities of Israel, and smote Ijon, and Dan, and Abel-beth-maachah, and all Cinneroth, with all the land of Naphtali.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>And it came to pass, when Baasha heard <span class='add'>thereof</span>, that he left off building of Ramah, and dwelt in Tirzah.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>Then king Asa made a proclamation throughout all Judah; none <span class='add'>was</span> exempted: and they took away the stones of Ramah, and the timber thereof, wherewith Baasha had builded; and king Asa built with them Geba of Benjamin, and Mizpah.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>The rest of all the acts of Asa, and all his might, and all that he did, and the cities which he built, <span class='add'>are</span> they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? Nevertheless in the time of his old age he was diseased in his feet.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>And Asa slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David his father: and Jehoshaphat his son reigned in his stead. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>And Nadab the son of Jeroboam began to reign over Israel in the second year of Asa king of Judah, and reigned over Israel two years.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>And he did evil in the sight of the LORD, and walked in the way of his father, and in his sin wherewith he made Israel to sin. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>And Baasha the son of Ahijah, of the house of Issachar, conspired against him; and Baasha smote him at Gibbethon, which <span class='add'>belonged</span> to the Philistines; for Nadab and all Israel laid siege to Gibbethon.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&nbsp;</span>Even in the third year of Asa king of Judah did Baasha slay him, and reigned in his stead.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&nbsp;</span>And it came to pass, when he reigned, <span class='add'>that</span> he smote all the house of Jeroboam; he left not to Jeroboam any that breathed, until he had destroyed him, according unto the saying of the LORD, which he spake by his servant Ahijah the Shilonite:  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&nbsp;</span>Because of the sins of Jeroboam which he sinned, and which he made Israel sin, by his provocation wherewith he provoked the LORD God of Israel to anger. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V31">31&nbsp;</span>Now the rest of the acts of Nadab, and all that he did, <span class='add'>are</span> they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&nbsp;</span>And there was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel all their days.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&nbsp;</span>In the third year of Asa king of Judah began Baasha the son of Ahijah to reign over all Israel in Tirzah, twenty and four years.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&nbsp;</span>And he did evil in the sight of the LORD, and walked in the way of Jeroboam, and in his sin wherewith he made Israel to sin. </div><ul class='tnav'>
