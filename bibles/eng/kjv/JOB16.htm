 <span class="verse" id="V1">1&nbsp;</span>Then Job answered and said,  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span>I have heard many such things: miserable comforters <span class='add'>are</span> ye all.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>Shall vain words have an end? or what emboldeneth thee that thou answerest?  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>I also could speak as ye <span class='add'>do:</span> if your soul were in my soul’s stead, I could heap up words against you, and shake mine head at you.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span> <span class='add'>But</span> I would strengthen you with my mouth, and the moving of my lips should asswage <span class='add'>your grief</span>.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>Though I speak, my grief is not asswaged: and <span class='add'>though</span> I forbear, what am I eased?  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>But now he hath made me weary: thou hast made desolate all my company.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>And thou hast filled me with wrinkles, <span class='add'>which</span> is a witness <span class='add'>against me:</span> and my leanness rising up in me beareth witness to my face.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>He teareth <span class='add'>me</span> in his wrath, who hateth me: he gnasheth upon me with his teeth; mine enemy sharpeneth his eyes upon me.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>They have gaped upon me with their mouth; they have smitten me upon the cheek reproachfully; they have gathered themselves together against me.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>God hath delivered me to the ungodly, and turned me over into the hands of the wicked.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>I was at ease, but he hath broken me asunder: he hath also taken <span class='add'>me</span> by my neck, and shaken me to pieces, and set me up for his mark.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>His archers compass me round about, he cleaveth my reins asunder, and doth not spare; he poureth out my gall upon the ground.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>He breaketh me with breach upon breach, he runneth upon me like a giant.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>I have sewed sackcloth upon my skin, and defiled my horn in the dust.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>My face is foul with weeping, and my eyelids is the shadow of death;  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>Not for <span class='add'>any</span> injustice in mine hands: also my prayer <span class='add'>is</span> pure.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>O earth, cover not thou my blood, and let my cry have no place.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>Also now, behold, my witness <span class='add'>is</span> in heaven, and my record <span class='add'>is</span> on high.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>My friends scorn me: <span class='add'>but</span> mine eye poureth out <span class='add'>tears</span> unto God.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>Oh that one might plead for a man with God, as a man <span class='add'>pleadeth</span> for his neighbour!  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>When a few years are come, then I shall go the way <span class='add'>whence</span> I shall not return. </div><ul class='tnav'>
