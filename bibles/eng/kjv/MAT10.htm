 <span class="verse" id="V1">1&nbsp;</span> And when he had called unto <span class='add'>him</span> his twelve disciples, he gave them power <span class='add'>against</span> unclean spirits, to cast them out, and to heal all manner of sickness and all manner of disease.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span> Now the names of the twelve apostles are these; The first, Simon, who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother; James <span class='add'>the son</span> of Zebedee, and John his brother;  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span> Philip, and Bartholomew; Thomas, and Matthew the publican; James <span class='add'>the son</span> of Alphaeus, and Lebbaeus, whose surname was Thaddaeus;  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span> Simon the Canaanite, and Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed him.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span> These twelve Jesus sent forth, and commanded them, saying, <span class='wj'> Go not into the way of the Gentiles, and into <span class='add'>any</span> city of the Samaritans enter ye not:</span>  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'> But go rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'> And as ye go, preach, saying, The kingdom of heaven is at hand.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'> Heal the sick, cleanse the lepers, raise the dead, cast out devils: freely ye have received, freely give.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'> Provide neither gold, nor silver, nor brass in your purses,</span>  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'> Nor scrip for <span class='add'>your</span> journey, neither two coats, neither shoes, nor yet staves: for the workman is worthy of his meat.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'> And into whatsoever city or town ye shall enter, enquire who in it is worthy; and there abide till ye go thence.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'> And when ye come into an house, salute it.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'> And if the house be worthy, let your peace come upon it: but if it be not worthy, let your peace return to you.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'> And whosoever shall not receive you, nor hear your words, when ye depart out of that house or city, shake off the dust of your feet.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'> Verily I say unto you, It shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrha in the day of judgment, than for that city.</span> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>¶ Behold, I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves: be ye therefore wise as serpents, and harmless as doves.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'> But beware of men: for they will deliver you up to the councils, and they will scourge you in their synagogues;</span>  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'> And ye shall be brought before governors and kings for my sake, for a testimony against them and the Gentiles.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'> But when they deliver you up, take no thought how or what ye shall speak: for it shall be given you in that same hour what ye shall speak.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'> For it is not ye that speak, but the Spirit of your Father which speaketh in you.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'> And the brother shall deliver up the brother to death, and the father the child: and the children shall rise up against <span class='add'>their</span> parents, and cause them to be put to death.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'> And ye shall be hated of all <span class='add'>men</span> for my name’s sake: but he that endureth to the end shall be saved.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'> But when they persecute you in this city, flee ye into another: for verily I say unto you, Ye shall not have gone over the cities of Israel, till the Son of man be come.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'> The disciple is not above <span class='add'>his</span> master, nor the servant above his lord.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'> It is enough for the disciple that he be as his master, and the servant as his lord. If they have called the master of the house Beelzebub, how much more <span class='add'>shall they call</span> them of his household?</span>  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'> Fear them not therefore: for there is nothing covered, that shall not be revealed; and hid, that shall not be known.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'> What I tell you in darkness, <span class='add'>that</span> speak ye in light: and what ye hear in the ear, <span class='add'>that</span> preach ye upon the housetops.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'> And fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul: but rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'> Are not two sparrows sold for a farthing? and one of them shall not fall on the ground without your Father.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'> But the very hairs of your head are all numbered.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'> Fear ye not therefore, ye are of more value than many sparrows.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'> Whosoever therefore shall confess me before men, him will I confess also before my Father which is in heaven.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'> But whosoever shall deny me before men, him will I also deny before my Father which is in heaven.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'> Think not that I am come to send peace on earth: I came not to send peace, but a sword.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'> For I am come to set a man at variance against his father, and the daughter against her mother, and the daughter in law against her mother in law.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'> And a man’s foes <span class='add'>shall be</span> they of his own household.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'> He that loveth father or mother more than me is not worthy of me: and he that loveth son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'> And he that taketh not his cross, and followeth after me, is not worthy of me.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'> He that findeth his life shall lose it: and he that loseth his life for my sake shall find it.</span> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V40">40&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>¶ He that receiveth you receiveth me, and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V41">41&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'> He that receiveth a prophet in the name of a prophet shall receive a prophet’s reward; and he that receiveth a righteous man in the name of a righteous man shall receive a righteous man’s reward.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V42">42&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'> And whosoever shall give to drink unto one of these little ones a cup of cold <span class='add'>water</span> only in the name of a disciple, verily I say unto you, he shall in no wise lose his reward.</span> </div><ul class='tnav'>
