 <span class="verse" id="V1">1&nbsp;</span>Then all Israel gathered themselves to David unto Hebron, saying, Behold, we <span class='add'>are</span> thy bone and thy flesh.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span>And moreover in time past, even when Saul was king, thou <span class='add'>wast</span> he that leddest out and broughtest in Israel: and the LORD thy God said unto thee, Thou shalt feed my people Israel, and thou shalt be ruler over my people Israel, and thou shalt be ruler over my people Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>Therefore came all the elders of Israel to the king to Hebron; and David made a covenant with them in Hebron before the LORD; and they anointed David king over Israel, according to the word of the LORD by Samuel. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>And David and all Israel went to Jerusalem, which <span class='add'>is</span> Jebus; where the Jebusites <span class='add'>were</span>, the inhabitants of the land.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>And the inhabitants of Jebus said to David, Thou shalt not come hither. Nevertheless David took the castle of Zion, which <span class='add'>is</span> the city of David.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>And David said, Whosoever smiteth the Jebusites first shall be chief and captain. So Joab the son of Zeruiah went first up, and was chief.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>And David dwelt in the castle; therefore they called it the city of David.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>And he built the city round about, even from Millo round about: and Joab repaired the rest of the city.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>So David waxed greater and greater: for the LORD of hosts <span class='add'>was</span> with him. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>These also <span class='add'>are</span> the chief of the mighty men whom David had, who strengthened themselves with him in his kingdom, <span class='add'>and</span> with all Israel, to make him king, according to the word of the LORD concerning Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>And this <span class='add'>is</span> the number of the mighty men whom David had; Jashobeam, an Hachmonite, the chief of the captains: he lifted up his spear against three hundred slain <span class='add'>by him</span> at one time.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>And after him <span class='add'>was</span> Eleazar the son of Dodo, the Ahohite, who <span class='add'>was one</span> of the three mighties.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>He was with David at Pas-dammim, and there the Philistines were gathered together to battle, where was a parcel of ground full of barley; and the people fled from before the Philistines.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>And they set themselves in the midst of <span class='add'>that</span> parcel, and delivered it, and slew the Philistines; and the LORD saved <span class='add'>them</span> by a great deliverance. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>Now three of the thirty captains went down to the rock to David, into the cave of Adullam; and the host of the Philistines encamped in the valley of Rephaim.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>And David <span class='add'>was</span> then in the hold, and the Philistines’ garrison <span class='add'>was</span> then at Beth-lehem.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>And David longed, and said, Oh that one would give me drink of the water of the well of Beth-lehem, that <span class='add'>is</span> at the gate!  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>And the three brake through the host of the Philistines, and drew water out of the well of Beth-lehem, that <span class='add'>was</span> by the gate, and took <span class='add'>it</span>, and brought <span class='add'>it</span> to David: but David would not drink <span class='add'>of</span> it, but poured it out to the LORD,  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>And said, My God forbid it me, that I should do this thing: shall I drink the blood of these men that have put their lives in jeopardy? for with <span class='add'>the jeopardy of</span> their lives they brought it.
