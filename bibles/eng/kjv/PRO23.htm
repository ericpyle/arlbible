 <span class="verse" id="V1">1&nbsp;</span>When thou sittest to eat with a ruler, consider diligently what <span class='add'>is</span> before thee:  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span>And put a knife to thy throat, if thou <span class='add'>be</span> a man given to appetite.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>Be not desirous of his dainties: for they <span class='add'>are</span> deceitful meat.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>Labour not to be rich: cease from thine own wisdom.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>Wilt thou set thine eyes upon that which is not? for <span class='add'>riches</span> certainly make themselves wings; they fly away as an eagle toward heaven.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>Eat thou not the bread of <span class='add'>him that hath</span> an evil eye, neither desire thou his dainty meats:  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>For as he thinketh in his heart, so <span class='add'>is</span> he: Eat and drink, saith he to thee; but his heart <span class='add'>is</span> not with thee.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>The morsel <span class='add'>which</span> thou hast eaten shalt thou vomit up, and lose thy sweet words.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>Speak not in the ears of a fool: for he will despise the wisdom of thy words.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>Remove not the old landmark; and enter not into the fields of the fatherless:  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>For their redeemer <span class='add'>is</span> mighty; he shall plead their cause with thee.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>Apply thine heart unto instruction, and thine ears to the words of knowledge.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>Withhold not correction from the child: for <span class='add'>if</span> thou beatest him with the rod, he shall not die.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>Thou shalt beat him with the rod, and shalt deliver his soul from hell.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>My son, if thine heart be wise, my heart shall rejoice, even mine.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>Yea, my reins shall rejoice, when thy lips speak right things.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>Let not thine heart envy sinners: but <span class='add'>be thou</span> in the fear of the LORD all the day long.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>For surely there is an end; and thine expectation shall not be cut off.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>Hear thou, my son, and be wise, and guide thine heart in the way.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>Be not among winebibbers; among riotous eaters of flesh:  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>For the drunkard and the glutton shall come to poverty: and drowsiness shall clothe <span class='add'>a man</span> with rags.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>Hearken unto thy father that begat thee, and despise not thy mother when she is old.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>Buy the truth, and sell <span class='add'>it</span> not; <span class='add'>also</span> wisdom, and instruction, and understanding.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>The father of the righteous shall greatly rejoice: and he that begetteth a wise <span class='add'>child</span> shall have joy of him.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>Thy father and thy mother shall be glad, and she that bare thee shall rejoice.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>My son, give me thine heart, and let thine eyes observe my ways.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>For a whore <span class='add'>is</span> a deep ditch; and a strange woman <span class='add'>is</span> a narrow pit.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&nbsp;</span>She also lieth in wait as <span class='add'>for</span> a prey, and increaseth the transgressors among men.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&nbsp;</span>Who hath woe? who hath sorrow? who hath contentions? who hath babbling? who hath wounds without cause? who hath redness of eyes?  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&nbsp;</span>They that tarry long at the wine; they that go to seek mixed wine.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&nbsp;</span>Look not thou upon the wine when it is red, when it giveth his colour in the cup, <span class='add'>when</span> it moveth itself aright.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&nbsp;</span>At the last it biteth like a serpent, and stingeth like an adder.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&nbsp;</span>Thine eyes shall behold strange women, and thine heart shall utter perverse things.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&nbsp;</span>Yea, thou shalt be as he that lieth down in the midst of the sea, or as he that lieth upon the top of a mast.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&nbsp;</span>They have stricken me, <span class='add'>shalt thou say, and</span> I was not sick; they have beaten me, <span class='add'>and</span> I felt <span class='add'>it</span> not: when shall I awake? I will seek it yet again. </div><ul class='tnav'>
