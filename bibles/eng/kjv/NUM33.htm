 <span class="verse" id="V1">1&nbsp;</span>These <span class='add'>are</span> the journeys of the children of Israel, which went forth out of the land of Egypt with their armies under the hand of Moses and Aaron.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span>And Moses wrote their goings out according to their journeys by the commandment of the LORD: and these <span class='add'>are</span> their journeys according to their goings out.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>And they departed from Rameses in the first month, on the fifteenth day of the first month; on the morrow after the passover the children of Israel went out with an high hand in the sight of all the Egyptians.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>For the Egyptians buried all <span class='add'>their</span> firstborn, which the LORD had smitten among them: upon their gods also the LORD executed judgments.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>And the children of Israel removed from Rameses, and pitched in Succoth.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>And they departed from Succoth, and pitched in Etham, which <span class='add'>is</span> in the edge of the wilderness.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>And they removed from Etham, and turned again unto Pi-hahiroth, which <span class='add'>is</span> before Baal-zephon: and they pitched before Migdol.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>And they departed from before Pi-hahiroth, and passed through the midst of the sea into the wilderness, and went three days’ journey in the wilderness of Etham, and pitched in Marah.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>And they removed from Marah, and came unto Elim: and in Elim <span class='add'>were</span> twelve fountains of water, and threescore and ten palm trees; and they pitched there.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>And they removed from Elim, and encamped by the Red sea.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>And they

Kehelathah, and pitched in mount Shapher.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>And they removed from mount Shapher, and encamped in Haradah.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>And they removed from Haradah, and pitched in Makheloth.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>And they removed from Makheloth, and encamped at Tahath.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>And they departed from Tahath, and pitched at Tarah.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&nbsp;</span>And they removed from Tarah, and pitched in Mithcah.  <span class="verse"

edge of the land of Edom.  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&nbsp;</span>And Aaron the priest went up into mount Hor at the commandment of the LORD, and died there, in the fortieth year after the children of Israel were come out of the land of Egypt, in the first <span class='add'>day</span> of the fifth month.  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&nbsp;</span>And Aaron <span class='add'>was</span>

class="verse" id="V50">50&nbsp;</span>And the LORD spake unto Moses in the plains of Moab by Jordan <span class='add'>near</span> Jericho, saying,  <span class="verse" id="V51">51&nbsp;</span>Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye are passed over Jordan into the land of Canaan;  <span class="verse" id="V52">52&nbsp;</span>Then ye shall drive out all the inhabitants of the land from before you, and destroy all their pictures, and destroy all their molten images, and quite pluck down all their high places:  <span class="verse" id="V53">53&nbsp;</span>And ye shall dispossess <span class='add'>the inhabitants</span> of the land, and dwell therein: for I have given you the land to possess it.  <span class="verse" id="V54">54&nbsp;</span>And ye shall divide the land by lot for an inheritance among your families: <span class='add'>and</span> to the more ye shall give the more inheritance, and to the fewer ye shall give the less inheritance: every man’s <span

drive out the inhabitants of the land from before you; then it shall come to pass, that those which ye let remain of them <span class='add'>shall be</span> pricks in your eyes, and thorns in your sides, and shall vex you in the land wherein ye dwell.  <span class="verse" id="V56">56&nbsp;</span>Moreover it shall come to pass, <span class='add'>that</span> I shall do unto you, as I thought to do unto them. </div><ul class='tnav'>
