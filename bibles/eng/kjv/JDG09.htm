 <span class="verse" id="V1">1&nbsp;</span>And Abimelech the son of Jerubbaal went to Shechem unto his mother’s brethren, and communed with them, and with all the family of the house of his mother’s father, saying,  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span>Speak, I pray you, in the ears of all the men of Shechem, Whether is better for you, either that all the sons of Jerubbaal, <span class='add'>which are</span> threescore and ten persons, reign over you, or that one reign over you? remember also that I <span class='add'>am</span> your bone and your flesh.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>And his mother’s brethren spake of him in the ears of all the men of Shechem all these words: and their hearts inclined to follow Abimelech; for they said, He <span class='add'>is</span> our brother.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>And they gave him threescore and ten <span class='add'>pieces</span> of silver out of the house of Baal-berith, wherewith Abimelech hired vain and light persons, which followed him.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>And he went unto his father’s house at Ophrah, and slew his brethren the sons of Jerubbaal, <span class='add'>being</span> threescore and ten persons, upon one stone: notwithstanding yet Jotham the youngest son of Jerubbaal was left; for he hid himself.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>And all the men of Shechem gathered together, and all the house of Millo, and went, and made Abimelech king, by the plain of the pillar that <span class='add'>was</span> in Shechem. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>And when they told <span class='add'>it</span> to Jotham, he went and stood in the top of mount Gerizim, and lifted up his voice, and cried, and said unto them, Hearken unto me, ye men of Shechem, that God may hearken unto you.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>The trees went forth <span class='add'>on a time</span> to anoint a king over them; and they said unto the olive tree, Reign thou over us.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>But the olive tree said unto them, Should I leave my fatness, wherewith by me they honour God and man, and go to be promoted over the trees?  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>And the trees said to the fig tree, Come thou, <span class='add'>and</span> reign over us.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>But the fig tree said unto them, Should I forsake my sweetness, and my good fruit, and go to be promoted over the trees?  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>Then said the trees unto the vine, Come thou, <span class='add'>and</span> reign over us.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>And the vine said unto them, Should I leave my wine, which cheereth God and man, and go to be promoted over the trees?

<span class='add'>is</span> not <span class='add'>he</span> the son of Jerubbaal? and Zebul his officer? serve the men of Hamor the father of Shechem: for why should we serve him?  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&nbsp;</span>And would to God this people were under my hand! then would I remove Abimelech.

And Zebul said unto him, Thou seest the shadow of the mountains as <span class='add'>if they were</span> men.  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&nbsp;</span>And Gaal spake again and said, See there come people down by the middle of the land, and another company come along by the plain of Meonenim.  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&nbsp;</span>Then said Zebul unto him, Where <span class='add'>is</span> now thy mouth, wherewith thou saidst, Who <span class='add'>is</span> Abimelech, that we should serve him? <span class='add'>is</span> not this the people that thou hast despised? go out, I pray now, and fight with them.  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&nbsp;</span>And Gaal went out before the men of Shechem, and fought with Abimelech.  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&nbsp;</span>And Abimelech chased him, and he fled before him, and many were overthrown <span class='add'>and</span> wounded, <span class='add'>even</span> unto the entering of the gate.  <span class="verse" id="V41">41&nbsp;</span>And Abimelech dwelt at Arumah: and Zebul thrust out Gaal and his brethren, that they should not dwell in Shechem.  <span class="verse" id="V42">42&nbsp;</span>And it came to pass on the morrow, that the people went out into the field; and they told Abimelech.  <span class="verse" id="V43">43&nbsp;</span>And he took the people, and divided them into three companies, and laid wait in the field, and looked, and, behold, the people <span class='add'>were</span> come forth out of the city; and he rose up against them, and smote them.  <span class="verse" id="V44">44&nbsp;</span>And Abimelech, and the company that <span class='add'>was</span> with him, rushed forward, and stood in the entering of the gate of the city: and the two <span class='add'>other</span> companies ran upon all <span class='add'>the people</span> that <span class='add'>were</span> in the fields, and slew them.  <span class="verse" id="V45">45&nbsp;</span>And Abimelech fought against the city all that day; and he took the city, and slew the people that <span class='add'>was</span> therein, and beat down the city, and sowed it with salt. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V46">46&nbsp;</span>And when all the men of the tower of Shechem heard <span class='add'>that</span>, they entered into an hold of the house of the god Berith.  <span class="verse" id="V47">47&nbsp;</span>And it was told Abimelech, that all the men of the tower of Shechem were gathered together.  <span class="verse" id="V48">48&nbsp;</span>And Abimelech gat him up to mount Zalmon, he and all the people that <span class='add'>were</span> with him; and Abimelech took an axe in his hand, and cut down a bough from the trees, and took it, and laid <span class='add'>it</span> on his shoulder, and said unto the people that <span class='add'>were</span> with him, What ye have seen me do, make haste, <span class='add'>and</span> do as I <span class='add'>have done</span>.  <span class="verse" id="V49">49&nbsp;</span>And all the people likewise cut down every man his bough, and followed Abimelech, and put <span class='add'>them</span> to the hold, and set the hold on fire upon them; so that all the men of the tower of Shechem died also, about a thousand men and women. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V50">50&nbsp;</span>Then went Abimelech to Thebez, and encamped against Thebez, and took it.  <span class="verse" id="V51">51&nbsp;</span>But there was a strong tower within the city, and thither fled all the men and women, and all they of the city, and shut <span class='add'>it</span> to them, and gat them up to the top of the tower.  <span class="verse" id="V52">52&nbsp;</span>And Abimelech came unto the tower, and fought against it, and went hard unto the door of the tower to burn it with fire.  <span class="verse" id="V53">53&nbsp;</span>And a certain woman cast a piece of a millstone upon Abimelech’s head, and all to brake his skull.  <span class="verse" id="V54">54&nbsp;</span>Then he called hastily unto the young man his armourbearer, and said unto him, Draw thy sword, and slay me, that men say not of me, A woman slew him.
