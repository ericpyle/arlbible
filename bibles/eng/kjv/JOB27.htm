 <span class="verse" id="V1">1&nbsp;</span>Moreover Job continued his parable, and said,  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span> <span class='add'>As</span> God liveth, <span class='add'>who</span> hath taken away my judgment; and the Almighty, <span class='add'>who</span> hath vexed my soul;  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>All the while my breath <span class='add'>is</span> in me, and the spirit of God <span class='add'>is</span> in my nostrils;  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>My lips shall not speak wickedness, nor my tongue utter deceit.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>God forbid that I should justify you: till I die I will not remove mine integrity from me.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>My righteousness I hold fast, and will not let it go: my heart shall not reproach <span class='add'>me</span> so long as I live.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>Let mine enemy be as the wicked, and he that riseth up against me as the unrighteous.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>For what <span class='add'>is</span> the hope of the hypocrite, though he hath gained, when God taketh away his soul?  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>Will God hear his cry when trouble cometh upon him?  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>Will he delight himself in the Almighty? will he always call upon God?  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>I will teach you by the hand of God: <span class='add'>that</span> which <span class='add'>is</span> with the Almighty will I not conceal.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>Behold, all ye yourselves have seen <span class='add'>it;</span> why then are ye thus altogether vain?  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>This <span class='add'>is</span> the portion of a wicked man with God, and the heritage of oppressors, <span class='add'>which</span> they shall receive of the Almighty.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>If his children be multiplied, <span class='add'>it is</span> for the sword: and his offspring shall not be satisfied with bread.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>Those that remain of him shall be buried in death: and his widows shall not weep.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>Though he heap up silver as the dust, and prepare raiment as the clay;  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>He may prepare <span class='add'>it</span>, but the just shall put <span class='add'>it</span> on, and the innocent shall divide the silver.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>He buildeth his house as a moth, and as a booth <span class='add'>that</span> the keeper maketh.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>The rich man shall lie down, but he shall not be gathered: he openeth his eyes, and he <span class='add'>is</span> not.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>Terrors take hold on him as waters, a tempest stealeth him away in the night.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>The east wind carrieth him away, and he departeth: and as a storm hurleth him out of his place.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>For <span class='add'>God</span> shall cast upon him, and not spare: he would fain flee out of his hand.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span> <span class='add'>Men</span> shall clap their hands at him, and shall hiss him out of his place. </div><ul class='tnav'>
