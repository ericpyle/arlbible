 <span class="verse" id="V1">1&nbsp;</span>Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span>Also, thou son of man, thus saith the Lord GOD unto the land of Israel; An end, the end is come upon the four corners of the land.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>Now <span class='add'>is</span> the end <span class='add'>come</span> upon thee, and I will send mine anger upon thee, and will judge thee according to thy ways, and will recompense upon thee all thine abominations.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>And mine eye shall not spare thee, neither will I have pity: but I will recompense thy ways upon thee, and thine abominations shall be in the midst of thee: and ye shall know that I <span class='add'>am</span> the LORD.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>Thus saith the Lord GOD; An evil, an only evil, behold, is come.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>An end is come, the end is come: it watcheth for thee; behold, it is come.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>The morning is come unto thee, O thou that dwellest in the land: the time is come, the day of trouble <span class='add'>is</span> near, and not the sounding again of the mountains.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>Now will I shortly pour out my fury upon thee, and accomplish mine anger upon thee: and I will judge thee according to thy ways, and will recompense thee for all thine abominations.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>And mine eye shall not spare, neither will I have pity: I will recompense thee according to thy ways and thine abominations <span class='add'>that</span> are in the midst of thee; and ye shall know that I <span class='add'>am</span> the LORD that smiteth.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>Behold the day, behold, it is come: the morning is gone forth; the rod hath blossomed, pride hath budded.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>Violence is risen up into a rod of wickedness: none of them <span class='add'>shall remain</span>, nor of their multitude, nor of any of theirs: neither <span class='add'>shall there be</span> wailing for them.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>The time is come, the day draweth near: let not the buyer rejoice, nor the seller mourn: for wrath <span class='add'>is</span> upon all the multitude thereof.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>For the seller shall not return to that which is sold, although they were yet alive: for the vision <span class='add'>is</span> touching the whole multitude thereof, <span class='add'>which</span> shall not return; neither shall any strengthen himself in the iniquity of his life.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>They have blown the trumpet, even to make all ready; but none goeth to the battle: for my wrath <span class='add'>is</span> upon all the multitude thereof.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>The sword <span class='add'>is</span> without, and the pestilence and the famine within: he that <span class='add'>is</span> in the field shall die with the sword; and he that <span class='add'>is</span> in the city, famine and pestilence shall devour him. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>But they that escape of them shall escape, and shall be on the mountains like doves of the valleys, all of them mourning, every one for his iniquity.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>All hands shall be feeble, and all knees shall be weak <span class='add'>as</span> water.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>They shall also gird <span class='add'>themselves</span> with sackcloth, and horror shall cover them; and shame <span class='add'>shall be</span> upon all faces, and baldness upon all their heads.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>They shall cast their silver in the streets, and their gold shall be removed: their silver and their gold shall not be able to deliver them in the day of the wrath of the LORD: they shall not satisfy their souls, neither fill their bowels: because it is the stumblingblock of their iniquity. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>As for the beauty of his ornament, he set it in majesty: but they made the images of their abominations <span class='add'>and</span> of their detestable things therein: therefore have I set it far from them.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>And I will give it into the hands of the strangers for a prey, and to the wicked of the earth for a spoil; and they shall pollute it.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>My face will I turn also from them, and they shall pollute my secret <span class='add'>place:</span> for the robbers shall enter into it, and defile it. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>Make a chain: for the land is full of bloody crimes, and the city is full of violence.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>Wherefore I will bring the worst of the heathen, and they shall possess their houses: I will also make the pomp of the strong to cease; and their holy places shall be defiled.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>Destruction cometh; and they shall seek peace, and <span class='add'>there shall be</span> none.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>Mischief shall come upon mischief, and rumour shall be upon rumour; then shall they seek a vision of the prophet; but the law shall perish from the priest, and counsel from the ancients.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>The king shall mourn, and the prince shall be clothed with desolation, and the hands of the people of the land shall be troubled: I will do unto them after their way, and according to their deserts will I judge them; and they shall know that I <span class='add'>am</span> the LORD. </div><ul class='tnav'>
