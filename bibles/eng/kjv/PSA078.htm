</div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>Behold, he smote the rock, that the waters gushed out, and the streams overflowed; can he give bread also? can he provide flesh for his people? </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>Therefore the LORD heard <span class='add'>this</span>, and was wroth: so a fire was kindled against Jacob, and anger also came up against Israel; </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>Because they believed not in God, and trusted not in his salvation: </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>Though he had commanded the clouds from above, and opened the doors of heaven, </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>And had rained down manna upon them to eat, and had given them of the corn of heaven. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>Man did eat angels’ food: he sent them meat to the full. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>He caused an east wind to blow in the heaven: and by his power he brought in the south wind. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>He rained flesh also upon them as dust, and feathered fowls like as the sand of the sea: </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V28">28&nbsp;</span>And he let <span class='add'>it</span> fall in the midst of their camp, round about their habitations. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V29">29&nbsp;</span>So they did eat, and were well filled: for he gave them their own desire; </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V30">30&nbsp;</span>They were not estranged from their lust. But while their meat <span class='add'>was</span> yet in their mouths, </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V31">31&nbsp;</span>The wrath of God came upon them, and slew the fattest of them, and smote down the chosen <span class='add'>men</span> of Israel. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V32">32&nbsp;</span>For all this they sinned still, and believed not for his wondrous works. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V33">33&nbsp;</span>Therefore their days did he consume in vanity, and their years in trouble. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V34">34&nbsp;</span>When he slew them, then they sought him: and they returned and enquired early after God. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V35">35&nbsp;</span>And they remembered that God <span class='add'>was</span> their rock, and the high God their redeemer. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V36">36&nbsp;</span>Nevertheless they did flatter him with their mouth, and they lied unto him with their tongues. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V37">37&nbsp;</span>For their heart was not right with him, neither were they stedfast in his covenant. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V38">38&nbsp;</span>But he, <span class='add'>being</span> full of compassion, forgave <span class='add'>their</span> iniquity, and destroyed <span class='add'>them</span> not: yea, many a time turned he his anger away, and did not stir up all his wrath. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V39">39&nbsp;</span>For he remembered that they <span class='add'>were but</span> flesh; a wind that passeth away, and cometh not again. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V40">40&nbsp;</span>How oft did they provoke him in the wilderness, <span class='add'>and</span> grieve him in the desert! </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V41">41&nbsp;</span>Yea, they turned back and tempted God, and limited the Holy One of Israel. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V42">42&nbsp;</span>They remembered not his hand, <span class='add'>nor</span> the day when he delivered them from the enemy. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V43">43&nbsp;</span>How he had wrought his signs in Egypt, and his wonders in the field of Zoan: </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V44">44&nbsp;</span>And had turned their rivers into blood; and their floods, that they could not drink. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V45">45&nbsp;</span>He sent divers sorts of flies among them, which devoured them; and frogs, which destroyed them. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V46">46&nbsp;</span>He gave also their increase unto the caterpiller, and their labour unto the locust. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V47">47&nbsp;</span>He destroyed their vines with hail, and their sycomore trees with frost. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V48">48&nbsp;</span>He gave up their cattle also to the hail, and their flocks to hot thunderbolts. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V49">49&nbsp;</span>He cast upon them the fierceness of his anger, wrath, and indignation, and trouble, by sending evil angels <span class='add'>among them</span>. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V50">50&nbsp;</span>He made a way to his anger; he spared not their soul from death, but gave their life over to the pestilence; </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V51">51&nbsp;</span>And smote all the firstborn in Egypt; the chief of <span class='add'>their</span> strength in the tabernacles of Ham: </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V52">52&nbsp;</span>But made his own people to go forth like sheep, and guided them in the wilderness like a flock. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V53">53&nbsp;</span>And he led them on safely, so that they feared not: but the sea overwhelmed their enemies. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V54">54&nbsp;</span>And he brought them to the border of his sanctuary, <span class='add'>even to</span> this mountain, <span class='add'>which</span> his right hand had purchased. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V55">55&nbsp;</span>He cast out the heathen also before them, and divided them an inheritance by line, and made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V56">56&nbsp;</span>Yet they tempted and provoked the most high God, and kept not his testimonies: </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V57">57&nbsp;</span>But turned back, and dealt unfaithfully like their fathers: they were turned aside like a deceitful bow. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V58">58&nbsp;</span>For they provoked him to anger with their high places, and moved him to jealousy with their graven images. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V59">59&nbsp;</span>When God heard <span class='add'>this</span>, he was wroth, and greatly abhorred Israel: </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V60">60&nbsp;</span>So that he forsook the tabernacle of Shiloh, the tent <span class='add'>which</span> he placed among men; </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V61">61&nbsp;</span>And delivered his strength into captivity, and his glory into the enemy’s hand. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V62">62&nbsp;</span>He gave his people over also unto the sword; and was wroth with his inheritance. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V63">63&nbsp;</span>The fire consumed their young men; and their maidens were not given to marriage. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V64">64&nbsp;</span>Their priests fell by the sword; and their widows made no lamentation. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V65">65&nbsp;</span>Then the Lord awaked as one out of sleep, <span class='add'>and</span> like a mighty man that shouteth by reason of wine. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V66">66&nbsp;</span>And he smote his enemies in the hinder parts: he put them to a perpetual reproach. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V67">67&nbsp;</span>Moreover he refused the tabernacle of Joseph, and chose not the tribe of Ephraim: </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V68">68&nbsp;</span>But chose the tribe of Judah, the mount Zion which he loved. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V69">69&nbsp;</span>And he built his sanctuary like high <span class='add'>palaces</span>, like the earth which he hath established for ever. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V70">70&nbsp;</span>He chose David also his servant, and took him from the sheepfolds: </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V71">71&nbsp;</span>From following the ewes great with young he brought him to feed Jacob his people, and Israel his inheritance. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V72">72&nbsp;</span>So he fed them according to the integrity of his heart;
