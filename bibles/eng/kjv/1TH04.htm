 <span class="verse" id="V1">1&nbsp;</span> Furthermore then we beseech you, brethren, and exhort <span class='add'>you</span> by the Lord Jesus, that as ye have received of us how ye ought to walk and to please God, <span class='add'> so</span> ye would abound more and more.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span> For ye know what commandments we gave you by the Lord Jesus.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span> For this is the will of God, <span class='add'>even</span> your sanctification, that ye should abstain from fornication:  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span> That every one of you should know how to possess his vessel in sanctification and honour;  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span> Not in the lust of concupiscence, even as the Gentiles which know not God:  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span> That no <span class='add'>man</span> go beyond and defraud his brother in <span class='add'>any</span> matter: because that the Lord <span class='add'>is</span> the avenger of all such, as we also have forewarned you and testified.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span> For God hath not called us unto uncleanness, but unto holiness.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span> He therefore that despiseth, despiseth not man, but God, who hath also given unto us his holy Spirit.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span> But as touching brotherly love ye need not that I write unto you: for ye yourselves are taught of God to love one another.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span> And indeed ye do it toward all the brethren which are in all Macedonia: but we beseech you, brethren, that ye increase more and more;  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span> And that ye study to be quiet, and to do your own business, and to work with your own hands, as we commanded you;  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span> That ye may walk honestly toward them that are without, and <span class='add'>that</span> ye may have lack of nothing. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span> But I would not have you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning them which are asleep, that ye sorrow not, even as others which have no hope.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span> For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span> For this we say unto you by the word of the Lord, that we which are alive <span class='add'>and</span> remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span> For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first:  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span> Then we which are alive <span class='add'>and</span> remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span> Wherefore comfort one another with these words. </div><ul class='tnav'>
