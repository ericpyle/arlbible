 <span class="verse" id="V1">1&nbsp;</span>Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel, and all the heads of the tribes, the chief of the fathers of the children of Israel, unto king Solomon in Jerusalem, that they might bring up the ark of the covenant of the LORD out of the city of David, which <span class='add'>is</span> Zion.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span>And all the men of Israel assembled themselves unto king Solomon at the feast in the month Ethanim, which <span class='add'>is</span> the seventh month.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>And all the elders of Israel came, and the priests took up the ark.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>And they brought up the ark of the LORD, and the tabernacle of the congregation, and all the holy vessels that <span class='add'>were</span> in the tabernacle, even those did the priests and the Levites bring up.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>And king Solomon, and all the congregation of Israel, that <span class='add'>were</span> assembled unto him, were with him before the ark, sacrificing sheep and oxen, that could not be told nor numbered for multitude.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>And the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of the LORD unto his place, into the oracle of the house, to the most holy <span class='add'>place, even</span> under the wings of the cherubims.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>For the cherubims spread forth <span class='add'>their</span> two wings over the place of the ark, and the cherubims covered the ark and the staves thereof above.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>And they drew out the staves, that the ends of the staves were seen out in the holy <span class='add'>place</span> before the oracle, and they were not seen without: and there they are unto this day.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span> <span class='add'>There was</span> nothing in the ark save the two tables of stone, which Moses put there at Horeb, when the LORD made <span class='add'>a covenant</span> with the children of Israel, when they came out of the land of Egypt.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>And it came to pass, when the priests were come out of the holy <span class='add'>place</span>, that the cloud filled the house of the LORD,  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>So that the priests could not stand to minister because of the cloud: for the glory of the LORD had filled the house of the LORD. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>Then spake Solomon, The LORD said that he would dwell in thick darkness.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>I have surely built thee an house to dwell in, a settled place for thee to abide in for ever.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>And the king turned his face about, and blessed all the congregation of Israel: (and all the congregation of Israel stood;)  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>And he said, Blessed <span class='add'>be</span> the LORD God of Israel, which spake with his mouth unto David my father, and hath with his hand fulfilled <span class='add'>it</span>, saying,  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>Since the day that I brought forth my people Israel out of Egypt, I chose no city out of all the tribes of Israel to build an house, that my name might be therein; but I chose David to be over my people Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>And it was in the heart of David my father to build an house for the name of the LORD God of Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>And the LORD said unto David my father, Whereas it was in thine heart to build an house unto my name, thou didst well that it was in thine heart.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>Nevertheless thou shalt not build the house; but thy son that shall come forth out of thy loins, he shall build the house unto my name.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>And the LORD hath performed his word that he spake, and I am risen up in the room of David my father, and sit on the throne of Israel, as the LORD promised, and have built an house for the name of the LORD God of Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>And I have set there a place for the ark, wherein <span class='add'>is</span> the covenant of the LORD, which he made with our fathers, when he brought them out of the land of Egypt. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>And Solomon stood before the altar of the LORD in the presence of all the congregation of Israel, and spread forth his hands toward heaven:  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>And he said, LORD God of Israel, <span class='add'>there is</span> no God like thee, in heaven above, or on earth beneath, who keepest covenant and mercy with thy servants that walk before thee with all their heart:  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>Who hast kept with thy servant David my father that thou promisedst him: thou spakest also with thy mouth, and hast fulfilled <span class='add'>it</span> with thine hand, as <span class='add'>it is</span> this day.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>Therefore now, LORD God of Israel, keep with thy servant David my father that thou promisedst him, saying, There shall not fail thee a man in my sight to sit on the throne of Israel;

how much less this house that I have builded?  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&nbsp;</span>Yet have thou respect unto the prayer of thy servant, and to his supplication, O LORD my God, to hearken unto the cry and to the prayer, which thy servant prayeth before thee to day:  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&nbsp;</span>That thine eyes may be open toward this house night and day, <span class='add'>even</span> toward the place of which thou hast said, My name shall be there: that thou mayest hearken unto the prayer which thy servant shall make toward this place.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&nbsp;</span>And hearken thou to the supplication of thy servant, and of thy people Israel, when they shall pray toward this place: and hear thou in heaven thy dwelling place: and when thou hearest, forgive. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V31">31&nbsp;</span>If any man trespass against his neighbour, and an oath be laid upon him to cause him to swear, and the oath come before thine altar in this house:  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&nbsp;</span>Then hear thou in heaven, and do, and judge thy servants, condemning the wicked, to bring his way upon his head;

So the king and all the children of Israel dedicated the house of the LORD.  <span class="verse" id="V64">64&nbsp;</span>The same day did the king hallow the middle of the court that <span class='add'>was</span> before the house of the LORD: for there he offered burnt offerings, and meat offerings, and the fat of the peace offerings: because the brasen altar that <span class='add'>was</span> before the LORD <span class='add'>was</span> too little to receive the burnt offerings, and meat offerings, and the fat of the peace offerings.  <span class="verse" id="V65">65&nbsp;</span>And at that time Solomon held a feast, and all Israel with him, a great congregation, from the entering in of Hamath unto the river of Egypt, before the LORD our God, seven days and seven days, <span class='add'>even</span> fourteen days.  <span class="verse" id="V66">66&nbsp;</span>On the eighth day he sent the people away: and they blessed the king, and went unto their tents joyful and glad of heart for all the goodness that the LORD had done for David his servant, and for Israel his people. </div><ul class='tnav'>
