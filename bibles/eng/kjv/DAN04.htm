Now thou, O Belteshazzar, declare the interpretation thereof, forasmuch as all the wise <span class='add'>men</span> of my kingdom are not able to make known unto me the interpretation: but thou <span class='add'>art</span> able; for the spirit of the holy gods <span class='add'>is</span> in thee. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>Then Daniel, whose name <span class='add'>was</span> Belteshazzar, was astonied for one hour, and his thoughts troubled him. The king spake, and said, Belteshazzar, let not the dream, or the interpretation thereof, trouble thee. Belteshazzar answered and said, My lord, the dream <span class='add'>be</span> to them that hate thee, and the interpretation thereof to thine enemies.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>The tree that thou sawest, which grew, and was strong, whose height reached unto the heaven, and the sight thereof to all the earth;  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>Whose leaves <span class='add'>were</span> fair, and the fruit thereof much, and in it <span class='add'>was</span> meat for all; under which the beasts of the field dwelt, and upon whose branches the fowls of the heaven had their habitation:  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>It <span class='add'>is</span> thou, O king, that art grown and become strong: for thy greatness is grown, and reacheth unto heaven, and thy dominion to the end of the earth.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>And whereas the king saw a watcher and an holy one coming down from heaven, and saying, Hew the tree down, and destroy it; yet leave the stump of the roots thereof in the earth, even with a band of iron and brass, in the tender grass of the field; and let it be wet with the dew of heaven, and <span class='add'>let</span> his portion <span class='add'>be</span> with the beasts of the field, till seven times pass over him;  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>This <span class='add'>is</span> the interpretation, O king, and this <span class='add'>is</span> the decree of the most High, which is come upon my lord the king:  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>That they shall drive thee from men, and thy dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field, and they shall make thee to eat grass as oxen, and they shall wet thee with the dew of heaven, and seven times shall pass over thee, till thou know that the most High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomsoever he will.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>And whereas they commanded to leave the stump of the tree roots; thy kingdom shall be sure unto thee, after that thou shalt have known that the heavens do rule.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>Wherefore, O king, let my counsel be acceptable unto thee, and break off thy sins by righteousness, and thine iniquities by shewing mercy to the poor; if it may be a lengthening of thy tranquility. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V28">28&nbsp;</span>All this came upon the king Nebuchadnezzar.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&nbsp;</span>At the end of twelve months he walked in the palace of the kingdom of Babylon.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&nbsp;</span>The king spake, and said, Is not this great Babylon, that I have built for the house of the kingdom by the might of my power, and for the honour of my majesty?  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&nbsp;</span>While the word <span class='add'>was</span> in the king’s mouth, there fell a voice from heaven, <span class='add'>saying</span>, O king Nebuchadnezzar, to thee it is spoken; The kingdom is departed from thee.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&nbsp;</span>And they shall drive thee from men, and thy dwelling <span class='add'>shall be</span> with the beasts of the field: they shall make thee to eat grass as oxen, and seven times shall pass over thee, until thou know that the most High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomsoever he will.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&nbsp;</span>The same hour was the thing fulfilled upon Nebuchadnezzar: and he was driven from men, and did eat grass as oxen, and his body was wet with the dew of heaven, till his hairs were grown like eagles <span class='add'>feathers</span>, and his nails like birds’ <span class='add'>claws</span>.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&nbsp;</span>And at the end of the days I Nebuchadnezzar lifted up mine eyes unto heaven, and mine understanding returned unto me, and I blessed the most High, and I praised and honoured him that liveth for ever, whose dominion <span class='add'>is</span> an everlasting dominion, and his kingdom <span class='add'>is</span> from generation to generation:  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&nbsp;</span>And all the inhabitants of the earth <span class='add'>are</span> reputed as nothing: and he doeth according to his will in the army of heaven, and <span class='add'>among</span> the inhabitants of the earth: and none can stay his hand, or say unto him, What doest thou?  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&nbsp;</span>At the same time my reason returned unto me; and for the glory of my kingdom, mine honour and brightness returned unto me; and my counsellors and my lords sought unto me; and I was established in my kingdom, and excellent majesty was added unto me.  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&nbsp;</span>Now I Nebuchadnezzar praise and extol and honour the King of heaven, all whose works <span class='add'>are</span> truth, and his ways judgment: and those that walk in pride he is able to abase. </div><ul class='tnav'>
