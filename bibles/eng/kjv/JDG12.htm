 <span class="verse" id="V1">1&nbsp;</span>And the men of Ephraim gathered themselves together, and went northward, and said unto Jephthah, Wherefore passedst thou over to fight against the children of Ammon, and didst not call us to go with thee? we will burn thine house upon thee with fire.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span>And Jephthah said unto them, I and my people were at great strife with the children of Ammon; and when I called you, ye delivered me not out of their hands.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>And when I saw that ye delivered <span class='add'>me</span> not, I put my life in my hands, and passed over against the children of Ammon, and the LORD delivered them into my hand: wherefore then are ye come up unto me this day, to fight against me?  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>Then Jephthah gathered together all the men of Gilead, and fought with Ephraim: and the men of Gilead smote Ephraim, because they said, Ye Gileadites <span class='add'>are</span> fugitives of Ephraim among the Ephraimites, <span class='add'>and</span> among the Manassites.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>And the Gileadites took the passages of Jordan before the Ephraimites: and it was <span class='add'>so</span>, that when those Ephraimites which were escaped said, Let me go over; that the men of Gilead said unto him, <span class='add'>Art</span> thou an Ephraimite? If he said, Nay;  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>Then said they unto him, Say now Shibboleth: and he said Sibboleth: for he could not frame to pronounce <span class='add'>it</span> right. Then they took him, and slew him at the passages of Jordan: and there fell at that time of the Ephraimites forty and two thousand.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>And Jephthah judged Israel six years. Then died Jephthah the Gileadite, and was buried in <span class='add'>one of</span> the cities of Gilead. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>And after him Ibzan of Beth-lehem judged Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>And he had thirty sons, and thirty daughters, <span class='add'>whom</span> he sent abroad, and took in thirty daughters from abroad for his sons.
