And the heart of Pharaoh was hardened, and he did not let the people go. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>And the LORD said unto Moses and unto Aaron, Take to you handfuls of ashes of the furnace, and let Moses sprinkle it toward the heaven in the sight of Pharaoh.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>And it shall become small dust in all the land of Egypt, and shall be a boil breaking forth <span class='add'>with</span> blains upon man, and upon beast, throughout all the land of Egypt.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>And they took ashes of the furnace, and stood before Pharaoh; and Moses sprinkled it up toward heaven; and it became a boil breaking forth <span class='add'>with</span> blains upon man, and upon beast.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>And the magicians could not stand before Moses because of the boils; for the boil was upon the magicians, and upon all the Egyptians.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>And the LORD hardened the heart of Pharaoh, and he hearkened not unto them; as the LORD had spoken unto Moses. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>And the LORD said unto Moses, Rise up early in the morning, and stand before Pharaoh, and say unto him, Thus saith the LORD God of the Hebrews, Let my people go, that they may serve me.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>For I will at this time send all my plagues upon thine heart, and upon thy servants, and upon thy people; that thou mayest know that <span class='add'>there is</span> none like me in all the earth.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>For now I will stretch out my hand, that I may smite thee and thy people with pestilence; and thou shalt be cut off from the earth.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>And in very deed for this <span class='add'>cause</span> have I raised thee up, for to shew <span class='add'>in</span> thee my power; and that my name may be declared throughout all the earth.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>As yet exaltest thou thyself against my people, that thou wilt not let them go?
