 <span class="verse" id="V1">1&nbsp;</span>Keep silence before me, O islands; and let the people renew <span class='add'>their</span> strength: let them come near; then let them speak: let us come near together to judgment.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span>Who raised up the righteous <span class='add'>man</span> from the east, called him to his foot, gave the nations before him, and made <span class='add'>him</span> rule over kings? he gave <span class='add'>them</span> as the dust to his sword, <span class='add'>and</span> as driven stubble to his bow.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>He pursued them, <span class='add'>and</span> passed safely; <span class='add'>even</span> by the way <span class='add'>that</span> he had not gone with his feet.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>Who hath wrought and done <span class='add'>it</span>, calling the generations from the beginning? I the LORD, the first, and with the last; I <span class='add'>am</span> he.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>The isles saw <span class='add'>it</span>, and feared; the ends of the earth were afraid, drew near, and came.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>They helped every one his neighbour; and <span class='add'>every one</span> said to his brother, Be of good courage.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>So the carpenter encouraged the goldsmith, <span class='add'>and</span> he that smootheth <span class='add'>with</span> the hammer him that smote the anvil, saying, It is ready for the sodering: and he fastened it with nails, <span class='add'>that</span> it should not be moved.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>But thou, Israel, <span class='add'>art</span> my servant, Jacob whom I have chosen, the seed of Abraham my friend.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span> <span class='add'>Thou</span> whom I have taken from the ends of the earth, and called thee from the chief men thereof, and said unto thee, Thou <span class='add'>art</span> my servant; I have chosen thee, and not cast thee away. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>Fear thou not; for I <span class='add'>am</span> with thee: be not dismayed; for I <span class='add'>am</span> thy God: I will strengthen thee; yea, I will help thee; yea, I will uphold thee with the right hand of my righteousness.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>Behold, all they that were incensed against thee shall be ashamed and confounded: they shall be as nothing; and they that strive with thee shall perish.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>Thou shalt seek them, and shalt not find them, <span class='add'>even</span> them that contended with thee: they that war against thee shall be as nothing, and as a thing of nought.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>For I the LORD thy God will hold thy right hand, saying unto thee, Fear not; I will help thee.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>Fear not, thou worm Jacob, <span class='add'>and</span> ye men of Israel; I will help thee, saith the LORD, and thy redeemer, the Holy One of Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>Behold, I will make thee a new sharp threshing instrument having teeth: thou shalt thresh the mountains, and beat <span class='add'>them</span> small, and shalt make the hills as chaff.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>Thou shalt fan them, and the wind shall carry them away, and the whirlwind shall scatter them: and thou shalt rejoice in the LORD, <span class='add'>and</span> shalt glory in the Holy One of Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span> <span class='add'>When</span> the poor and needy seek water, and <span class='add'>there is</span> none, <span class='add'>and</span> their tongue faileth for thirst, I the LORD will hear them, <span class='add'>I</span> the God of Israel will not forsake them.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>I will open rivers in high places, and fountains in the midst of the valleys: I will make the wilderness a pool of water, and the dry land springs of water.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>I will plant in the wilderness the cedar, the shittah tree, and the myrtle, and the oil tree; I will set in the desert the fir tree, <span class='add'>and</span> the pine, and the box tree together:  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>That they may see, and know, and consider, and understand together, that the hand of the LORD hath done this, and the Holy One of Israel hath created it.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>Produce your cause, saith the LORD; bring forth your strong <span class='add'>reasons</span>, saith the King of Jacob.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>Let them bring <span class='add'>them</span> forth, and shew us what shall happen: let them shew the former things, what they <span class='add'>be</span>, that we may consider them, and know the latter end of them; or declare us things for to come.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>Shew the things that are to come hereafter, that we may know that ye <span class='add'>are</span> gods: yea, do good, or do evil, that we may be dismayed, and behold <span class='add'>it</span> together.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>Behold, ye <span class='add'>are</span> of nothing, and your work of nought: an abomination <span class='add'>is he that</span> chooseth you.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>I have raised up <span class='add'>one</span> from the north, and he shall come: from the rising of the sun shall he call upon my name: and he shall come upon princes as <span class='add'>upon</span> morter, and as the potter treadeth clay.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>Who hath declared from the beginning, that we may know?
