 <span class="verse" id="V1">1&nbsp;</span>Now will I sing to my wellbeloved a song of my beloved touching his vineyard. My wellbeloved hath a vineyard in a very fruitful hill:  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span>And he fenced it, and gathered out the stones thereof, and planted it with the choicest vine, and built a tower in the midst of it, and also made a winepress therein: and he looked that it should bring forth grapes, and it brought forth wild grapes.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>And now, O inhabitants of Jerusalem, and men of Judah, judge, I pray you, betwixt me and my vineyard.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>What could have been done more to my vineyard, that I have not done in it? wherefore, when I looked that it should bring forth grapes, brought it forth wild grapes?  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>And now go to; I will tell you what I will do to my vineyard: I will take away the hedge thereof, and it shall be eaten up; <span class='add'>and</span> break down the wall thereof, and it shall be trodden down:  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>And I will lay it waste: it shall not be pruned, nor digged; but there shall come up briers and thorns: I will also command the clouds that they rain no rain upon it.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>For the vineyard of the LORD of hosts <span class='add'>is</span> the house of Israel, and the men of Judah his pleasant plant: and he looked for judgment, but behold oppression; for righteousness, but behold a cry. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>Woe unto them that join house to house, <span class='add'>that</span> lay field to field, till <span class='add'>there be</span> no place, that they may be placed alone in the midst of the earth!  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>In mine ears <span class='add'>said</span> the LORD of hosts, Of a truth many houses shall be desolate, <span class='add'>even</span> great and fair, without inhabitant.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>Yea, ten acres of vineyard shall yield one bath, and the seed of an homer shall yield an ephah. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>Woe unto them that rise up early in the morning, <span class='add'>that</span> they may follow strong drink; that continue until night, <span class='add'>till</span> wine inflame them!  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>And the harp, and the viol, the tabret, and pipe, and wine, are in their feasts: but they regard not the work of the LORD, neither consider the operation of his hands. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>Therefore my people are gone into captivity, because <span class='add'>they have</span> no knowledge: and their honourable men <span class='add'>are</span> famished, and their multitude dried up with thirst.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>Therefore hell hath enlarged herself, and opened her mouth without measure: and their glory, and their multitude, and their pomp, and he that rejoiceth, shall descend into it.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>And the mean man shall be brought down, and the mighty man shall be humbled, and the eyes of the lofty shall be humbled:  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>But the LORD of hosts shall be exalted in judgment, and God that is holy shall be sanctified in righteousness.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>Then shall the lambs feed after their manner, and the waste places of the fat ones shall strangers eat.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>Woe unto them that draw iniquity with cords of vanity, and sin as it were with a cart rope:  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>That say, Let him make speed, <span class='add'>and</span> hasten his work, that we may see it: and let the counsel of the Holy One of Israel draw nigh and come, that we may know <span class='add'>it!</span> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>Woe unto them that call evil good, and good evil; that put darkness for light, and light for darkness; that put bitter for sweet, and sweet for bitter!  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>Woe unto <span class='add'>them that are</span> wise in their own eyes, and prudent in their own sight!  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>Woe unto <span class='add'>them that are</span> mighty to drink wine, and men of strength to mingle strong drink:  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>Which justify the wicked for reward, and take away the righteousness of the righteous from him!  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>Therefore as the fire devoureth the stubble, and the flame consumeth the chaff, <span class='add'>so</span> their root shall be as rottenness, and their blossom shall go up as dust: because they have cast away the law of the LORD of hosts, and despised the word of the Holy One of Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>Therefore is the anger of the LORD kindled against his people, and he hath stretched forth his hand against them, and hath smitten them: and the hills did tremble, and their carcases <span class='add'>were</span> torn in the midst of the streets. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand <span class='add'>is</span> stretched out still. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>And he will lift up an ensign to the nations from far, and will hiss unto them from the end of the earth: and, behold, they shall come with speed swiftly:  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>None shall be weary nor stumble among them; none shall slumber nor sleep; neither shall the girdle of their loins be loosed, nor the latchet of their shoes be broken:  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&nbsp;</span>Whose arrows <span class='add'>are</span> sharp, and all their bows bent, their horses’ hoofs shall be counted like flint, and their wheels like a whirlwind:  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&nbsp;</span>Their roaring <span class='add'>shall be</span> like a lion, they shall roar like young lions: yea, they shall roar, and lay hold of the prey, and shall carry <span class='add'>it</span> away safe, and none shall deliver <span class='add'>it</span>.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&nbsp;</span>And in that day they shall roar against them like the roaring of the sea: and if <span class='add'>one</span> look unto the land, behold darkness <span class='add'>and</span> sorrow, and the light is darkened in the heavens thereof. </div><ul class='tnav'>
