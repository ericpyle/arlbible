 <span class="verse" id="V1">1&nbsp;</span>And the children of Israel set forward, and pitched in the plains of Moab on this side Jordan <span class='add'>by</span> Jericho. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span>And Balak the son of Zippor saw all that Israel had done to the Amorites.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>And Moab was sore afraid of the people, because they <span class='add'>were</span> many: and Moab was distressed because of the children of Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>And Moab said unto the elders of Midian, Now shall this company lick up all <span class='add'>that are</span> round about us, as the ox licketh up the grass of the field. And Balak the son of Zippor <span class='add'>was</span> king of the Moabites at that time.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>He sent messengers therefore unto Balaam the son of Beor to Pethor, which <span class='add'>is</span> by the river of the land of the children of his people, to call him, saying, Behold, there is a people come out from Egypt: behold, they cover the face of the earth, and they abide over against me:  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>Come now therefore, I pray thee, curse me this people; for they <span class='add'>are</span> too mighty for me: peradventure I shall prevail, <span class='add'>that</span> we may smite them, and <span class='add'>that</span> I may drive them out of the land: for I wot that he whom thou blessest <span class='add'>is</span> blessed, and he whom thou cursest is cursed.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>And the elders of Moab and the elders of Midian departed with the rewards of divination in their hand; and they came unto Balaam, and spake unto him the words of Balak.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>And he said unto them, Lodge here this night, and I will bring you word again, as the LORD shall speak unto me: and the princes of Moab abode with Balaam.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>And God came unto Balaam, and said, What men <span class='add'>are</span> these with thee?  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>And Balaam said unto God, Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, hath sent unto me, <span class='add'>saying,</span>  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>Behold, <span class='add'>there is</span> a people come out of Egypt, which covereth the face of the earth: come now, curse me them; peradventure I shall be able to overcome them, and drive them out.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>And God said unto Balaam, Thou shalt not go with them; thou shalt not curse the people: for they <span class='add'>are</span> blessed.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>And Balaam rose up in the morning, and said unto the princes of Balak, Get you into your land: for the LORD refuseth to give me leave to go with you.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>And the princes of Moab rose up, and they went unto Balak, and said, Balaam refuseth to come with us. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>And Balak sent yet again princes, more, and more honourable than they.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>And they came to Balaam, and said to him, Thus saith Balak the son of Zippor, Let nothing, I pray thee, hinder thee from coming unto me:  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>For I will promote thee unto very great honour, and I will do whatsoever thou sayest unto me: come therefore, I pray thee, curse me this people.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>And Balaam answered and said unto the servants of Balak, If Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold, I cannot go beyond the word of the LORD my God, to do less or more.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>Now therefore, I pray you, tarry ye also here this night, that I may know what the LORD will say unto me more.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>And God came unto Balaam at night, and said unto him, If the men come to call thee, rise up, <span class='add'>and</span> go with them; but yet the word which I shall say unto thee, that shalt thou do.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>And Balaam rose up in the morning, and saddled his ass, and went with the princes of Moab. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>And God’s anger was kindled because he went: and the angel of the LORD stood in the way for an adversary against him. Now he was riding upon his ass, and his two servants <span class='add'>were</span> with him.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>And the ass saw the angel of the LORD standing in the way, and his sword drawn in his hand: and the ass turned aside out of the way, and went into the field: and Balaam smote the ass, to turn her into the way.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>But the angel of the LORD stood in a path of the vineyards, a wall <span class='add'>being</span> on this side, and a wall on that side.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>And when the ass saw the angel of the LORD, she thrust herself unto the wall, and crushed Balaam’s foot against the wall: and he smote her again.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>And the angel of the LORD went further, and stood in a narrow place, where <span class='add'>was</span> no way to turn either to the right hand or to the left.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>And when the ass saw the angel of the LORD, she fell down under Balaam: and Balaam’s anger was kindled, and he smote the ass with a staff.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&nbsp;</span>And the LORD opened the mouth of the ass, and she said unto Balaam, What have I done unto thee, that thou hast smitten me these three times?  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&nbsp;</span>And Balaam said unto the ass, Because thou hast mocked me: I would there were a sword in mine hand, for now would I kill thee.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&nbsp;</span>And the ass said unto Balaam, <span class='add'>Am</span> not I thine ass, upon which thou hast ridden ever since <span class='add'>I was</span> thine unto this day? was I ever wont to do so unto thee? And he said, Nay.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&nbsp;</span>Then the LORD opened the eyes of Balaam, and he saw the angel of the LORD standing in the way, and his sword drawn in his hand: and he bowed down his head, and fell flat on his face.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&nbsp;</span>And the angel of the LORD said unto him, Wherefore hast thou smitten thine ass these three times? behold, I went out to withstand thee, because <span class='add'>thy</span> way is perverse before me:  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&nbsp;</span>And the ass saw me, and turned from me these three times: unless she had turned from me, surely now also I had slain thee, and saved her alive.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&nbsp;</span>And Balaam said unto the angel of the LORD, I have sinned; for I knew not that thou stoodest in the way against me: now therefore, if it displease thee, I will get me back again.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&nbsp;</span>And the angel of the LORD said unto Balaam, Go with the men: but only the word that I shall speak unto thee, that thou shalt speak. So Balaam went with the princes of Balak. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V36">36&nbsp;</span>And when Balak heard that Balaam was come, he went out to meet him unto a city of Moab, which <span class='add'>is</span> in the border of Arnon, which <span class='add'>is</span> in the utmost coast.  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&nbsp;</span>And Balak said unto Balaam, Did I not earnestly send unto thee to call thee? wherefore camest thou not unto me? am I not able indeed to promote thee to honour?  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&nbsp;</span>And Balaam said unto Balak, Lo, I am come unto thee: have I now any power at all to say any thing? the word that God putteth in my mouth, that shall I speak.  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&nbsp;</span>And Balaam went with Balak, and they came unto Kirjath-huzoth.  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&nbsp;</span>And Balak offered oxen and sheep, and sent to Balaam, and to the princes that <span class='add'>were</span> with him.  <span class="verse" id="V41">41&nbsp;</span>And it came to pass on the morrow, that Balak took Balaam, and brought him up into the high places of Baal, that thence he might see the utmost <span class='add'>part</span> of the people. </div><ul class='tnav'>
