 <span class="verse" id="V1">1&nbsp;</span>And the LORD spake unto Moses in the plains of Moab by Jordan <span class='add'>near</span> Jericho, saying,  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span>Command the children of Israel, that they give unto the Levites of the inheritance of their possession cities to dwell in; and ye shall give <span class='add'>also</span> unto the Levites suburbs for the cities round about them.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>And the cities shall they have to dwell in; and the suburbs of them shall be for their cattle, and for their goods, and for all their beasts.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>And the suburbs of the cities, which ye shall give unto the Levites, <span class='add'>shall reach</span> from the wall of the city and outward a thousand cubits round about.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>And ye shall measure from without the city on the east side two thousand cubits, and on the south side two thousand cubits, and on the west side two thousand cubits, and on the north side two thousand cubits and the city <span class='add'>shall be</span> in the midst: this shall be to them the suburbs of the cities.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>And among the cities which ye shall give unto the Levites <span class='add'>there shall be</span> six cities for refuge, which ye shall appoint for the manslayer, that he may flee thither: and to them ye shall add forty and two cities.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span> <span class='add'>So</span> all the cities which ye shall give to the Levites <span class='add'>shall be</span> forty and eight cities: them <span class='add'>shall ye give</span> with their suburbs.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>And the cities which ye shall give <span class='add'>shall be</span> of the possession of the children of Israel: from <span class='add'>them that have</span> many ye shall give many; but from <span class='add'>them that have</span> few ye shall give few: every one shall give of his cities unto the Levites according to his inheritance which he inheriteth. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye be come over Jordan into the land of Canaan;  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>Then ye shall appoint you cities to be cities of refuge for you; that the slayer may flee thither, which killeth any person at unawares.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>And they shall be unto you cities for refuge from the avenger; that the manslayer die not, until he stand before the congregation in judgment.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>And of these cities which ye shall give six cities shall ye have for refuge.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>Ye shall give three cities on this side Jordan, and three cities shall ye give in the land of Canaan, <span class='add'>which</span> shall be cities of refuge.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>These six cities shall be a refuge, <span class='add'>both</span> for the children of Israel, and for the stranger, and for the sojourner among them: that every one that killeth any person unawares may flee thither.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>And if he smite him with an instrument of iron, so that he die, he <span class='add'>is</span> a murderer: the murderer shall surely be put to death.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>And if he smite him with throwing a stone, wherewith he may die, and he die, he is a murderer: the murderer shall surely be put to death.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>Or <span class='add'>if</span> he smite him with an hand weapon of wood, wherewith he may die, and he die, he <span class='add'>is</span> a murderer: the murderer shall surely be put to death.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>The revenger of blood himself shall slay the murderer: when he meeteth him, he shall slay him.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>But if he thrust him of hatred, or hurl at him by laying of wait, that he die;
