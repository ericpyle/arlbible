 <span class="verse" id="V1">1&nbsp;</span>After this opened Job his mouth, and cursed his day.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span>And Job spake, and said,  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>Let the day perish wherein I was born, and the night <span class='add'>in which</span> it was said, There is a man child conceived.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>Let that day be darkness; let not God regard it from above, neither let the light shine upon it.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>Let darkness and the shadow of death stain it; let a cloud dwell upon it; let the blackness of the day terrify it.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>As <span class='add'>for</span> that night, let darkness seize upon it; let it not be joined unto the days of the year, let it not come into the number of the months.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>Lo, let that night be solitary, let no joyful voice come therein.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>Let them curse it that curse the day, who are ready to raise up their mourning.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>Let the stars of the twilight thereof be dark; let it look for light, but <span class='add'>have</span> none; neither let it see the dawning of the day:  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>Because it shut not up the doors of my <span class='add'>mother’s</span> womb, nor hid sorrow from mine eyes.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>Why died I not from the womb? <span class='add'>why</span> did I <span class='add'>not</span> give up the ghost when I came out of the belly?  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>Why did the knees prevent me? or why the breasts that I should suck?  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>For now should I have lain still and been quiet, I should have slept: then had I been at rest,  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>With kings and counsellors of the earth, which built desolate places for themselves;  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>Or with princes that had gold, who filled their houses with silver:  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>Or as an hidden untimely birth I had not been; as infants <span class='add'>which</span> never saw light.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>There the wicked cease <span class='add'>from</span> troubling; and there the weary be at rest.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span> <span class='add'>There</span> the prisoners rest together; they hear not the voice of the oppressor.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>The small and great are there; and the servant <span class='add'>is</span> free from his master.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>Wherefore is light given to him that is in misery, and life unto the bitter <span class='add'>in</span> soul;  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>Which long for death, but it <span class='add'>cometh</span> not; and dig for it more than for hid treasures;  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>Which rejoice exceedingly, <span class='add'>and</span> are glad, when they can find the grave?  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span> <span class='add'>Why is light given</span> to a man whose way is hid, and whom God hath hedged in?  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>For my sighing cometh before I eat, and my roarings are poured out like the waters.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>For the thing which I greatly feared is come upon me, and that which I was afraid of is come unto me.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>I was not in safety, neither had I rest, neither was I quiet; yet trouble came. </div><ul class='tnav'>
