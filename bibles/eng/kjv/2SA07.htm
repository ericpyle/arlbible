 <span class="verse" id="V1">1&nbsp;</span>And it came to pass, when the king sat in his house, and the LORD had given him rest round about from all his enemies;  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span>That the king said unto Nathan the prophet, See now, I dwell in an house of cedar, but the ark of God dwelleth within curtains.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>And Nathan said to the king, Go, do all that <span class='add'>is</span> in thine heart; for the LORD <span class='add'>is</span> with thee. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>And it came to pass that night, that the word of the LORD came unto Nathan, saying,  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>Go and tell my servant David, Thus saith the LORD, Shalt thou build me an house for me to dwell in?  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>Whereas I have not dwelt in <span class='add'>any</span> house since the time that I brought up the children of Israel out of Egypt, even to this day, but have walked in a tent and in a tabernacle.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>In all <span class='add'>the places</span> wherein I have walked with all the children of Israel spake I a word with any of the tribes of Israel, whom I commanded to feed my people Israel, saying, Why build ye not me an house of cedar?  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>Now therefore so shalt thou say unto my servant David, Thus saith the LORD of hosts, I took thee from the sheepcote, from following the sheep, to be ruler over my people, over Israel:  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>And I was with thee whithersoever thou wentest, and have cut off all thine enemies out of thy sight, and have made thee a great name, like unto the name of the great <span class='add'>men</span> that <span class='add'>are</span> in the earth.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>Moreover I will appoint a place for my people Israel, and will plant them, that they may dwell in a place of their own, and move no more; neither shall the children of wickedness afflict them any more, as beforetime,  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>And as since the time that I commanded judges <span class='add'>to be</span> over my people Israel, and have caused thee to rest from all thine enemies. Also the LORD telleth thee that he will make thee an house. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>And when thy days be fulfilled, and thou shalt sleep with thy fathers, I will set up thy seed after thee, which shall proceed out of thy bowels, and I will establish his kingdom.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>He shall build an house for my name, and I will stablish the throne of his kingdom for ever.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>I will be his father, and he shall be my son. If he commit iniquity, I will chasten him with the rod of men, and with the stripes of the children of men:  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>But my mercy shall not depart away from him, as I took <span class='add'>it</span> from Saul, whom I put away before thee.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>And thine house and thy kingdom shall be established for ever before thee: thy throne shall be established for ever.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so did Nathan speak unto David. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>Then went king David in, and sat before the LORD, and he said, Who <span class='add'>am</span> I, O Lord GOD? and what <span class='add'>is</span> my house, that thou hast brought me hitherto?  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>And this was yet a small thing in thy sight, O Lord GOD; but thou hast spoken also of thy servant’s house for a great while to come.
