 <span class="verse" id="V1">1&nbsp;</span>And the word of the LORD came unto Jonah the second time, saying,  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span>Arise, go unto Nineveh, that great city, and preach unto it the preaching that I bid thee.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>So Jonah arose, and went unto Nineveh, according to the word of the LORD. Now Nineveh was an exceeding great city of three days’ journey.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>And Jonah began to enter into the city a day’s journey, and he cried, and said, Yet forty days, and Nineveh shall be overthrown. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>So the people of Nineveh believed God, and proclaimed a fast, and put on sackcloth, from the greatest of them even to the least of them.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>For word came unto the king of Nineveh, and he arose from his throne, and he laid his robe from him, and covered <span class='add'>him</span> with sackcloth, and sat in ashes.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>And he caused <span class='add'>it</span> to be proclaimed and published through Nineveh by the decree of the king and his nobles, saying, Let neither man nor beast, herd nor flock, taste any thing: let them not feed, nor drink water:  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>But let man and beast be covered with sackcloth, and cry mightily unto God: yea, let them turn every one from his evil way, and from the violence that <span class='add'>is</span> in their hands.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>Who can tell <span class='add'>if</span> God will turn and repent, and turn away from his fierce anger, that we perish not? </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>And God saw their works, that they turned from their evil way; and God repented of the evil, that he had said that he would do unto them; and he did <span class='add'>it</span> not. </div><ul class='tnav'>
