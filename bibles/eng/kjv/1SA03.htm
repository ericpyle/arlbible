 <span class="verse" id="V1">1&nbsp;</span>And the child Samuel ministered unto the LORD before Eli. And the word of the LORD was precious in those days; <span class='add'>there was</span> no open vision.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span>And it came to pass at that time, when Eli <span class='add'>was</span> laid down in his place, and his eyes began to wax dim, <span class='add'>that</span> he could not see;  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>And ere the lamp of God went out in the temple of the LORD, where the ark of God <span class='add'>was</span>, and Samuel was laid down <span class='add'>to sleep;</span>  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>That the LORD called Samuel: and he answered, Here <span class='add'>am</span> I.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>And he ran unto Eli, and said, Here <span class='add'>am</span> I; for thou calledst me. And he said, I called not; lie down again. And he went and lay down.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>And the LORD called yet again, Samuel. And Samuel arose and went to Eli, and said, Here <span class='add'>am</span> I; for thou didst call me. And he answered, I called not, my son; lie down again.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>Now Samuel did not yet know the LORD, neither was the word of the LORD yet revealed unto him.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>And the LORD called Samuel again the third time. And he arose and went to Eli, and said, Here <span class='add'>am</span> I; for thou didst call me. And Eli perceived that the LORD had called the child.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>Therefore Eli said unto Samuel, Go, lie down: and it shall be, if he call thee, that thou shalt say, Speak, LORD; for thy servant heareth. So Samuel went and lay down in his place.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>And the LORD came, and stood, and called as at other times, Samuel, Samuel. Then Samuel answered, Speak; for thy servant heareth. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>And the LORD said to Samuel, Behold, I will do a thing in Israel, at which both the ears of every one that heareth it shall tingle.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>In that day I will perform against Eli all <span class='add'>things</span> which I have spoken concerning his house: when I begin, I will also make an end.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>For I have told him that I will judge his house for ever for the iniquity which he knoweth; because his sons made themselves vile, and he restrained them not.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>And therefore I have sworn unto the house of Eli, that the iniquity of Eli’s house shall not be purged with sacrifice nor offering for ever. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>And Samuel lay until the morning, and opened the doors of the house of the LORD. And Samuel feared to shew Eli the vision.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>Then Eli called Samuel, and said, Samuel, my son. And he answered, Here <span class='add'>am</span> I.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>And he said, What <span class='add'>is</span> the thing that <span class='add'>the LORD</span> hath said unto thee? I pray thee hide <span class='add'>it</span> not from me: God do so to thee, and more also, if thou hide <span class='add'>any</span> thing from me of all the things that he said unto thee.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>And Samuel told him every whit, and hid nothing from him. And he said, It <span class='add'>is</span> the LORD: let him do what seemeth him good. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>And Samuel grew, and the LORD was with him, and did let none of his words fall to the ground.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>And all Israel from Dan even to Beer-sheba knew that Samuel <span class='add'>was</span> established <span class='add'>to be</span> a prophet of the LORD.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>And the LORD appeared again in Shiloh: for the LORD revealed himself to Samuel in Shiloh by the word of the LORD. </div><ul class='tnav'>
