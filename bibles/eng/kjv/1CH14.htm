 <span class="verse" id="V1">1&nbsp;</span>Now Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and timber of cedars, with masons and carpenters, to build him an house.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span>And David perceived that the LORD had confirmed him king over Israel, for his kingdom was lifted up on high, because of his people Israel. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>And David took more wives at Jerusalem: and David begat more sons and daughters.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>Now these <span class='add'>are</span> the names of <span class='add'>his</span> children which he had in Jerusalem; Shammua, and Shobab, Nathan, and Solomon,  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>And Ibhar, and Elishua, and Elpalet,  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>And Nogah, and Nepheg, and Japhia,  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>And Elishama, and Beeliada, and Eliphalet. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>And when the Philistines heard that David was anointed king over all Israel, all the Philistines went up to seek David. And David heard <span class='add'>of it</span>, and went out against them.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>And the Philistines came and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>And David enquired of God, saying, Shall I go up against the Philistines? and wilt thou deliver them into mine hand? And the LORD said unto him, Go up; for I will deliver them into thine hand.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>So they came up to Baal-perazim; and David smote them there. Then David said, God hath broken in upon mine enemies by mine hand like the breaking forth of waters: therefore they called the name of that place Baal-perazim.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>And when they had left their gods there, David gave a commandment, and they were burned with fire.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>And the Philistines yet again spread themselves abroad in the valley.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>Therefore David enquired again of God; and God said unto him, Go not up after them; turn away from them, and come upon them over against the mulberry trees.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>And it shall be, when thou shalt hear a sound of going in the tops of the mulberry trees, <span class='add'>that</span> then thou shalt go out to battle: for God is gone forth before thee to smite the host of the Philistines.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>David therefore did as God commanded him: and they smote the host of the Philistines from Gibeon even to Gazer.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>And the fame of David went out into all lands; and the LORD brought the fear of him upon all nations. </div><ul class='tnav'>
