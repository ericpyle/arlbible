 <span class="verse" id="V1">1&nbsp;</span>And when the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon, she came to prove Solomon with hard questions at Jerusalem, with a very great company, and camels that bare spices, and gold in abundance, and precious stones: and when she was come to Solomon, she communed with him of all that was in her heart.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span>And Solomon told her all her questions: and there was nothing hid from Solomon which he told her not.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>And when the queen of Sheba had seen the wisdom of Solomon, and the house that he had built,  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>And the meat of his table, and the sitting of his servants, and the attendance of his ministers, and their apparel; his cupbearers also, and their apparel; and his ascent by which he went up into the house of the LORD; there was no more spirit in her.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>And she said to the king, <span class='add'>It was</span> a true report which I heard in mine own land of thine acts, and of thy wisdom:  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>Howbeit I believed not their words, until I came, and mine eyes had seen <span class='add'>it:</span> and, behold, the one half of the greatness of thy wisdom was not told me: <span class='add'>for</span> thou exceedest the fame that I heard.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>Happy <span class='add'>are</span> thy men, and happy <span class='add'>are</span> these thy servants, which stand continually before thee, and hear thy wisdom.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>Blessed be the LORD thy God, which delighted in thee to set thee on his throne, <span class='add'>to be</span> king for the LORD thy God: because thy God loved Israel, to establish them for ever, therefore made he thee king over them, to do judgment and justice.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>And she gave the king an hundred and twenty talents of gold, and of spices great abundance, and precious stones: neither was there any such spice as the queen of Sheba gave king Solomon.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>And the servants also of Huram, and the servants of Solomon, which brought gold from Ophir, brought algum trees and precious stones.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>And the king made <span class='add'>of</span> the algum trees terraces to the house of the LORD, and to the king’s palace, and harps and psalteries for singers: and there were none such seen before in the land of Judah.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>And king Solomon gave to the queen of Sheba all her desire, whatsoever she asked, beside <span class='add'>that</span> which she had brought unto the king. So she turned, and went away to her own land, she and her servants. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six hundred and threescore and six talents of gold;  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>Beside <span class='add'>that which</span> chapmen and merchants brought. And all the kings of Arabia and governors of the country brought gold and silver to Solomon. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>And king Solomon made two hundred targets of beaten gold: six hundred <span class='add'>shekels</span> of beaten gold went to one target.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>And three hundred shields <span class='add'>made he of</span> beaten gold: three hundred <span class='add'>shekels</span> of gold went to one shield. And the king put them in the house of the forest of Lebanon.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>Moreover the king made a great throne of ivory, and overlaid it with pure gold.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>And <span class='add'>there were</span> six steps to the throne, with a footstool of gold, <span class='add'>which were</span> fastened to the throne, and stays on each side of the sitting place, and two lions standing by the stays:  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>And twelve lions stood there on the one side and on the other upon the six steps.
