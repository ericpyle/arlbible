 <span class="verse" id="V1">1&nbsp;</span>Moreover Job continued his parable, and said,  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span>Oh that I were as <span class='add'>in</span> months past, as <span class='add'>in</span> the days <span class='add'>when</span> God preserved me;  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>When his candle shined upon my head, <span class='add'>and when</span> by his light I walked <span class='add'>through</span> darkness;  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>As I was in the days of my youth, when the secret of God <span class='add'>was</span> upon my tabernacle;  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>When the Almighty <span class='add'>was</span> yet with me, <span class='add'>when</span> my children <span class='add'>were</span> about me;  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>When I washed my steps with butter, and the rock poured me out rivers of oil;  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>When I went out to the gate through the city, <span class='add'>when</span> I prepared my seat in the street!  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>The young men saw me, and hid themselves: and the aged arose, <span class='add'>and</span> stood up.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>The princes refrained talking, and laid <span class='add'>their</span> hand on their mouth.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>The nobles held their peace, and their tongue cleaved to the roof of their mouth.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>When the ear heard <span class='add'>me</span>, then it blessed me; and when the eye saw <span class='add'>me</span>, it gave witness to me:  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>Because I delivered the poor that cried, and the fatherless, and <span class='add'>him that had</span> none to help him.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>The blessing of him that was ready to perish came upon me: and I caused the widow’s heart to sing for joy.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>I put on righteousness, and it clothed me: my judgment <span class='add'>was</span> as a robe and a diadem.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>I was eyes to the blind, and feet <span class='add'>was</span> I to the lame.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>I <span class='add'>was</span> a father to the poor: and the cause <span class='add'>which</span> I knew not I searched out.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>And I brake the jaws of the wicked, and plucked the spoil out of his teeth.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>Then I said, I shall die in my nest, and I shall multiply <span class='add'>my</span> days as the sand.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>My root <span class='add'>was</span> spread out by the waters, and the dew lay all night upon my branch.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>My glory <span class='add'>was</span> fresh in me, and my bow was renewed in my hand.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>Unto me <span class='add'>men</span> gave ear, and waited, and kept silence at my counsel.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>After my words they spake not again; and my speech dropped upon them.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>And they waited for me as for the rain; and they opened their mouth wide <span class='add'>as</span> for the latter rain.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span> <span class='add'>If</span> I laughed on them, they believed <span class='add'>it</span> not; and the light of my countenance they cast not down.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>I chose out their way, and sat chief, and dwelt as a king in the army, as one <span class='add'>that</span> comforteth the mourners. </div><ul class='tnav'>
