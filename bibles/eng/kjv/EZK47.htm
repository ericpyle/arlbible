Again he measured a thousand, and brought me through; the waters <span class='add'>were</span> to the loins.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>Afterward he measured a thousand; <span class='add'>and it was</span> a river that I could not pass over: for the waters were risen, waters to swim in, a river that could not be passed over. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>And he said unto me, Son of man, hast thou seen <span class='add'>this?</span> Then he brought me, and caused me to return to the brink of the river.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>Now when I had returned, behold, at the bank of the river <span class='add'>were</span> very many trees on the one side and on the other.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>Then said he unto me, These waters issue out toward the east country, and go down into the desert, and go into the sea: <span class='add'>which being</span> brought forth into the sea, the waters shall be healed.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>And it shall come to pass, <span class='add'>that</span> every thing that liveth, which moveth, whithersoever the rivers shall come, shall live: and there shall be a very great multitude of fish, because these waters shall come thither: for they shall be healed; and every thing shall live whither the river cometh.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>And it shall come to pass, <span class='add'>that</span> the fishers shall stand upon it from En-gedi even unto En-eglaim; they shall be a <span class='add'>place</span> to spread forth nets; their fish shall be according to their kinds, as the fish of the great sea, exceeding many.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>But the miry places thereof and the marishes thereof shall not be healed; they shall be given to salt.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>And by the river upon the bank thereof, on this side and on that side, shall grow all trees for meat, whose leaf shall not fade, neither shall the fruit thereof be consumed: it shall bring forth new fruit according to his months, because their waters they issued out of the sanctuary: and the fruit thereof shall be for meat, and the leaf thereof for medicine. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>Thus saith the Lord GOD; This <span class='add'>shall be</span> the border, whereby ye shall inherit the land according to the twelve tribes of Israel: Joseph <span class='add'>shall have two</span> portions.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>And ye shall inherit it, one as well as another: <span class='add'>concerning</span> the which I lifted up mine hand to give it unto your fathers: and this land shall fall unto you for inheritance.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>And this <span class='add'>shall be</span> the border of the land toward the north side, from the great sea, the way of Hethlon, as men go to Zedad;  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>Hamath, Berothah, Sibraim, which <span class='add'>is</span> between the border of Damascus and the border of Hamath; Hazar-hatticon, which is by the coast of Hauran.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>And the border from the sea shall be Hazar-enan, the border of Damascus, and the north northward, and the border of Hamath.
