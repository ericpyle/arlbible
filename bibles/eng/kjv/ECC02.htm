 <span class="verse" id="V1">1&nbsp;</span>I said in mine heart, Go to now, I will prove thee with mirth, therefore enjoy pleasure: and, behold, this also <span class='add'>is</span> vanity.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span>I said of laughter, <span class='add'>It is</span> mad: and of mirth, What doeth it?  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>I sought in mine heart to give myself unto wine, yet acquainting mine heart with wisdom; and to lay hold on folly, till I might see what <span class='add'>was</span> that good for the sons of men, which they should do under the heaven all the days of their life.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>I made me great works; I builded me houses; I planted me vineyards:  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>I made me gardens and orchards, and I planted trees in them of all <span class='add'>kind of</span> fruits:  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>I made me pools of water, to water therewith the wood that bringeth forth trees:  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>I got <span class='add'>me</span> servants and maidens, and had servants born in my house; also I had great possessions of great and small cattle above all that were in Jerusalem before me:  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>I gathered me also silver and gold, and the peculiar treasure of kings and of the provinces: I gat me men singers and women singers, and the delights of the sons of men, <span class='add'>as</span> musical instruments, and that of all sorts.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>So I was great, and increased more than all that were before me in Jerusalem: also my wisdom remained with me.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>And whatsoever mine eyes desired I kept not from them, I withheld not my heart from any joy; for my heart rejoiced in all my labour: and this was my portion of all my labour.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>Then I looked on all the works that my hands had wrought, and on the labour that I had laboured to do: and, behold, all <span class='add'>was</span> vanity and vexation of spirit, and <span class='add'>there was</span> no profit under the sun.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>And I turned myself to behold wisdom, and madness, and folly: for what <span class='add'>can</span> the man <span class='add'>do</span> that cometh after the king? <span class='add'>even</span> that which hath been already done.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>Then I saw that wisdom excelleth folly, as far as light excelleth darkness.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>The wise man’s eyes <span class='add'>are</span> in his head; but the fool walketh in darkness: and I myself perceived also that one event happeneth to them all.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>Then said I in my heart, As it happeneth to the fool, so it happeneth even to me; and why was I then more wise? Then I said in my heart, that this also <span class='add'>is</span> vanity.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>For <span class='add'>there is</span> no remembrance of the wise more than of the fool for ever; seeing that which now <span class='add'>is</span> in the days to come shall all be forgotten. And how dieth the wise <span class='add'>man?</span> as the fool.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>Therefore I hated life; because the work that is wrought under the sun is grievous unto me: for all <span class='add'>is</span> vanity and vexation of spirit. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>Yea, I hated all my labour which I had taken under the sun: because I should leave it unto the man that shall be after me.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>And who knoweth whether he shall be a wise <span class='add'>man</span> or a fool? yet shall he have rule over all my labour wherein I have laboured, and wherein I have shewed myself wise under the sun. This <span class='add'>is</span> also vanity.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>Therefore I went about to cause my heart to despair of all the labour which I took under the sun.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>For there is a man whose labour <span class='add'>is</span> in wisdom, and in knowledge, and in equity; yet to a man that hath not laboured therein shall he leave it <span class='add'>for</span> his portion. This also <span class='add'>is</span> vanity and a great evil.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>For what hath man of all his labour, and of the vexation of his heart, wherein he hath laboured under the sun?  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>For all his days <span class='add'>are</span> sorrows, and his travail grief; yea, his heart taketh not rest in the night. This is also vanity. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span> <span class='add'>There is</span> nothing better for a man, <span class='add'>than</span> that he should eat and drink, and <span class='add'>that</span> he should make his soul enjoy good in his labour. This also I saw, that it <span class='add'>was</span> from the hand of God.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>For who can eat, or who else can hasten <span class='add'>hereunto</span>, more than I?  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>For <span class='add'>God</span> giveth to a man that <span class='add'>is</span> good in his sight wisdom, and knowledge, and joy: but to the sinner he giveth travail, to gather and to heap up, that he may give to <span class='add'>him that is</span> good before God. This also <span class='add'>is</span> vanity and vexation of spirit. </div><ul class='tnav'>
