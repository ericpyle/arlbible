 <span class="verse" id="V1">1&nbsp;</span>And the king sent, and they gathered unto him all the elders of Judah and of Jerusalem.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span>And the king went up into the house of the LORD, and all the men of Judah and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem with him, and the priests, and the prophets, and all the people, both small and great: and he read in their ears all the words of the book of the covenant which was found in the house of the LORD. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>And the king stood by a pillar, and made a covenant before the LORD, to walk after the LORD, and to keep his commandments and his testimonies and his statutes with all <span class='add'>their</span> heart and all <span class='add'>their</span> soul, to perform the words of this covenant that were written in this book. And all the people stood to the covenant.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>And the king commanded Hilkiah the high priest, and the priests of the second order, and the keepers of the door, to bring forth out of the temple of the LORD all the vessels that were made for Baal, and for the grove, and for all the host of heaven: and he burned them without Jerusalem in the fields of Kidron, and carried the ashes of them unto Beth-el.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>And he put down the idolatrous priests, whom the kings of Judah had ordained to burn incense in the high places in the cities of Judah, and in the places round about Jerusalem; them also that burned incense unto Baal, to the sun, and to the moon, and to the planets, and to all the host of heaven.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>And he brought out the grove from the house of the LORD, without Jerusalem, unto the brook Kidron, and burned it at the brook Kidron, and stamped <span class='add'>it</span> small to powder, and cast the powder thereof upon the graves of the children of the people.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>And he brake down the houses of the sodomites, that <span class='add'>were</span> by the house of the LORD, where the women wove hangings for the grove.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>And he brought all the priests out of the cities of Judah, and defiled the high places where the priests had burned incense, from Geba to Beer-sheba, and brake down the high places of the gates that <span class='add'>were</span> in the entering in of the gate of Joshua the governor of the city, which <span class='add'>were</span> on a man’s left hand at the gate of the city.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>Nevertheless the priests of the high places came not up to the altar of the LORD in Jerusalem, but they did eat of the unleavened bread among their brethren.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>And he defiled Topheth, which <span class='add'>is</span> in the valley of the children of Hinnom, that no man might make his son or his daughter to pass through the fire to Molech.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>And he took away the horses that the kings of Judah had given to the sun, at the entering in of the house of the LORD, by the chamber of Nathan-melech the chamberlain, which <span class='add'>was</span> in the suburbs, and burned the chariots of the sun with fire.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>And the altars that <span class='add'>were</span> on the top of the upper chamber of Ahaz, which the kings of Judah had made, and the altars which Manasseh had made in the two courts of the house of the LORD, did the king beat down, and brake <span class='add'>them</span> down from thence, and cast the dust of them into the brook Kidron.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>And the high places that <span class='add'>were</span> before Jerusalem, which <span class='add'>were</span> on the right hand of the mount of corruption, which Solomon the king of Israel had builded for Ashtoreth the abomination of the Zidonians, and for Chemosh the abomination of the Moabites, and for Milcom the abomination of the children of Ammon, did the king defile.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>And he brake in pieces the images, and cut down the groves, and filled their places with the bones of men. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>Moreover the altar that <span class='add'>was</span> at Beth-el, <span class='add'>and</span> the high place which Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin, had made, both that altar and the high place he brake down, and burned the high place, <span class='add'>and</span> stamped <span class='add'>it</span> small to powder, and burned the grove.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>And as Josiah turned himself, he spied the sepulchres that <span class='add'>were</span> there in the mount, and sent, and took the bones out of the sepulchres, and burned <span class='add'>them</span> upon the altar, and polluted it, according to the word of the LORD which the man of God proclaimed, who proclaimed these words.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>Then he said, What title <span class='add'>is</span> that that I see? And the men of the city told him, <span class='add'>It is</span> the sepulchre of the man of God, which came from Judah, and proclaimed these things that thou hast done against the altar of Beth-el.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>And he said, Let him alone; let no man move his bones.
