 <span class="verse" id="V1">1&nbsp;</span>Then answered Eliphaz the Temanite, and said,  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span>Should a wise man utter vain knowledge, and fill his belly with the east wind?  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>Should he reason with unprofitable talk? or with speeches wherewith he can do no good?  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>Yea, thou castest off fear, and restrainest prayer before God.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>For thy mouth uttereth thine iniquity, and thou choosest the tongue of the crafty.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>Thine own mouth condemneth thee, and not I: yea, thine own lips testify against thee.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span> <span class='add'>Art</span> thou the first man <span class='add'>that</span> was born? or wast thou made before the hills?  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>Hast thou heard the secret of God? and dost thou restrain wisdom to thyself?  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>What knowest thou, that we know not? <span class='add'>what</span> understandest thou, which <span class='add'>is</span> not in us?  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>With us <span class='add'>are</span> both the grayheaded and very aged men, much elder than thy father.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span> <span class='add'>Are</span> the consolations of God small with thee? is there any secret thing with thee?  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>Why doth thine heart carry thee away? and what do thy eyes wink at,  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>That thou turnest thy spirit against God, and lettest <span class='add'>such</span> words go out of thy mouth?  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>What <span class='add'>is</span> man, that he should be clean? and <span class='add'>he which is</span> born of a woman, that he should be righteous?  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>Behold, he putteth no trust in his saints; yea, the heavens are not clean in his sight.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>How much more abominable and filthy <span class='add'>is</span> man, which drinketh iniquity like water?  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>I will shew thee, hear me; and that <span class='add'>which</span> I have seen I will declare;  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>Which wise men have told from their fathers, and have not hid <span class='add'>it:</span>  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>Unto whom alone the earth was given, and no stranger passed among them.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>The wicked man travaileth with pain all <span class='add'>his</span> days, and the number of years is hidden to the oppressor.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>A dreadful sound <span class='add'>is</span> in his ears: in prosperity the destroyer shall come upon him.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>He believeth not that he shall return out of darkness, and he is waited for of the sword.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>He wandereth abroad for bread, <span class='add'>saying</span>, Where <span class='add'>is it?</span> he knoweth that the day of darkness is ready at his hand.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>Trouble and anguish shall make him afraid; they shall prevail against him, as a king ready to the battle.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>For he stretcheth out his hand against God, and strengtheneth himself against the Almighty.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>He runneth upon him, <span class='add'>even</span> on <span class='add'>his</span> neck, upon the thick bosses of his bucklers:  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>Because he covereth his face with his fatness, and maketh collops of fat on <span class='add'>his</span> flanks.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&nbsp;</span>And he dwelleth in desolate cities, <span class='add'>and</span> in houses which no man inhabiteth, which are ready to become heaps.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&nbsp;</span>He shall not be rich, neither shall his substance continue, neither shall he prolong the perfection thereof upon the earth.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&nbsp;</span>He shall not depart out of darkness; the flame shall dry up his branches, and by the breath of his mouth shall he go away.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&nbsp;</span>Let not him that is deceived trust in vanity: for vanity shall be his recompence.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&nbsp;</span>It shall be accomplished before his time, and his branch shall not be green.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&nbsp;</span>He shall shake off his unripe grape as the vine, and shall cast off his flower as the olive.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&nbsp;</span>For the congregation of hypocrites <span class='add'>shall be</span> desolate, and fire shall consume the tabernacles of bribery.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&nbsp;</span>They conceive mischief, and bring forth vanity, and their belly prepareth deceit. </div><ul class='tnav'>
