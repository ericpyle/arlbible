 <span class="verse" id="V1">1&nbsp;</span>Through desire a man, having separated himself, seeketh <span class='add'>and</span> intermeddleth with all wisdom.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span>A fool hath no delight in understanding, but that his heart may discover itself.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>When the wicked cometh, <span class='add'>then</span> cometh also contempt, and with ignominy reproach.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>The words of a man’s mouth <span class='add'>are as</span> deep waters, <span class='add'>and</span> the wellspring of wisdom <span class='add'>as</span> a flowing brook.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span> <span class='add'>It is</span> not good to accept the person of the wicked, to overthrow the righteous in judgment.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>A fool’s lips enter into contention, and his mouth calleth for strokes.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>A fool’s mouth <span class='add'>is</span> his destruction, and his lips <span class='add'>are</span> the snare of his soul.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>The words of a talebearer <span class='add'>are</span> as wounds, and they go down into the innermost parts of the belly.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>He also that is slothful in his work is brother to him that is a great waster.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>The name of the LORD <span class='add'>is</span> a strong tower: the righteous runneth into it, and is safe.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>The rich man’s wealth <span class='add'>is</span> his strong city, and as an high wall in his own conceit.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>Before destruction the heart of man is haughty, and before honour <span class='add'>is</span> humility.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>He that answereth a matter before he heareth <span class='add'>it</span>, it <span class='add'>is</span> folly and shame unto him.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>The spirit of a man will sustain his infirmity; but a wounded spirit who can bear?  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>The heart of the prudent getteth knowledge; and the ear of the wise seeketh knowledge.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>A man’s gift maketh room for him, and bringeth him before great men.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span> <span class='add'>He that is</span> first in his own cause <span class='add'>seemeth</span> just; but his neighbour cometh and searcheth him.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>The lot causeth contentions to cease, and parteth between the mighty.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>A brother offended <span class='add'>is harder to be won</span> than a strong city: and <span class='add'>their</span> contentions <span class='add'>are</span> like the bars of a castle.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>A man’s belly shall be satisfied with the fruit of his mouth; <span class='add'>and</span> with the increase of his lips shall he be filled.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>Death and life <span class='add'>are</span> in the power of the tongue: and they that love it shall eat the fruit thereof.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span> <span class='add'>Whoso</span> findeth a wife findeth a good <span class='add'>thing</span>, and obtaineth favour of the LORD.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>The poor useth intreaties; but the rich answereth roughly.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>A man <span class='add'>that hath</span> friends must shew himself friendly: and there is a friend <span class='add'>that</span> sticketh closer than a brother. </div><ul class='tnav'>
