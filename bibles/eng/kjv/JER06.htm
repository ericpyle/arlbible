 <span class="verse" id="V1">1&nbsp;</span>O ye children of Benjamin, gather yourselves to flee out of the midst of Jerusalem, and blow the trumpet in Tekoa, and set up a sign of fire in Beth-haccerem: for evil appeareth out of the north, and great destruction.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span>I have likened the daughter of Zion to a comely and delicate <span class='add'>woman</span>.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>The shepherds with their flocks shall come unto her; they shall pitch <span class='add'>their</span> tents against her round about; they shall feed every one in his place.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>Prepare ye war against her; arise, and let us go up at noon. Woe unto us! for the day goeth away, for the shadows of the evening are stretched out.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>Arise, and let us go by night, and let us destroy her palaces. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>For thus hath the LORD of hosts said, Hew ye down trees, and cast a mount against Jerusalem: this <span class='add'>is</span> the city to be visited; she <span class='add'>is</span> wholly oppression in the midst of her.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>As a fountain casteth out her waters, so she casteth out her wickedness: violence and spoil is heard in her; before me continually is grief and wounds.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>Be thou instructed, O Jerusalem, lest my soul depart from thee; lest I make thee desolate, a land not inhabited. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>Thus saith the LORD of hosts, They shall throughly glean the remnant of Israel as a vine: turn back thine hand as a grapegatherer into the baskets.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>To whom shall I speak, and give warning, that they may hear? behold, their ear <span class='add'>is</span> uncircumcised, and they cannot hearken: behold, the word of the LORD is unto them a reproach; they have no delight in it.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>Therefore I am full of the fury of the LORD; I am weary with holding in: I will pour it out upon the children abroad, and upon the assembly of young men together: for even the husband with the wife shall be taken, the aged with <span class='add'>him that is</span> full of days.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>And their houses shall be turned unto others, <span class='add'>with their</span> fields and wives together: for I will stretch out my hand upon the inhabitants of the land, saith the LORD.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>For from the least of them even unto the greatest of them every one <span class='add'>is</span> given to covetousness; and from the prophet even unto the priest every one dealeth falsely.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>They have healed also the hurt <span class='add'>of the daughter</span> of my people slightly, saying, Peace, peace; when <span class='add'>there is</span> no peace.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>Were they ashamed when they had committed abomination? nay, they were not at all ashamed, neither could they blush: therefore they shall fall among them that fall: at the time <span class='add'>that</span> I visit them they shall be cast down, saith the LORD.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>Thus saith the LORD, Stand ye in the ways, and see, and ask for the old paths, where is the good way, and walk therein, and ye shall find rest for your souls. But they said, We will not walk <span class='add'>therein</span>.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>Also I set watchmen over you, <span class='add'>saying</span>, Hearken to the sound of the trumpet. But they said, We will not hearken. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>Therefore hear, ye nations, and know, O congregation, what <span class='add'>is</span> among them.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>Hear, O earth: behold, I will bring evil upon this people, <span class='add'>even</span> the fruit of their thoughts, because they have not hearkened unto my words, nor to my law, but rejected it.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>To what purpose cometh there to me incense from Sheba, and the sweet cane from a far country? your burnt offerings <span class='add'>are</span> not acceptable, nor your sacrifices sweet unto me.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>Therefore thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will lay stumblingblocks before this people, and the fathers and the sons together shall fall upon them; the neighbour and his friend shall perish.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>Thus saith the LORD, Behold, a people cometh from the north country, and a great nation shall be raised from the sides of the earth.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>They shall lay hold on bow and spear; they <span class='add'>are</span> cruel, and have no mercy; their voice roareth like the sea; and they ride upon horses, set in array as men for war against thee, O daughter of Zion.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>We have heard the fame thereof: our hands wax feeble: anguish hath taken hold of us, <span class='add'>and</span> pain, as of a woman in travail.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>Go not forth into the field, nor walk by the way; for the sword of the enemy <span class='add'>and</span> fear <span class='add'>is</span> on every side. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>O daughter of my people, gird <span class='add'>thee</span> with sackcloth, and wallow thyself in ashes: make thee mourning, <span class='add'>as for</span> an only son, most bitter lamentation: for the spoiler shall suddenly come upon us.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>I have set thee <span class='add'>for</span> a tower <span class='add'>and</span> a fortress among my people, that thou mayest know and try their way.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&nbsp;</span>They <span class='add'>are</span> all grievous revolters, walking with slanders: <span class='add'>they are</span> brass and iron; they <span class='add'>are</span> all corrupters.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&nbsp;</span>The bellows are burned, the lead is consumed of the fire; the founder melteth in vain: for the wicked are not plucked away.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&nbsp;</span>Reprobate silver shall <span class='add'>men</span> call them, because the LORD hath rejected them. </div><ul class='tnav'>
