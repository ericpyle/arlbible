 <span class="verse" id="V1">1&nbsp;</span>And the LORD said unto Moses, Go in unto Pharaoh: for I have hardened his heart, and the heart of his servants, that I might shew these my signs before him:  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span>And that thou mayest tell in the ears of thy son, and of thy son’s son, what things I have wrought in Egypt, and my signs which I have done among them; that ye may know how that I <span class='add'>am</span> the LORD.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>And Moses and Aaron came in unto Pharaoh, and said unto him, Thus saith the LORD God of the Hebrews, How long wilt thou refuse to humble thyself before me? let my people go, that they may serve me.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>Else, if thou refuse to let my people go, behold, to morrow will I bring the locusts into thy coast:  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>And they shall cover the face of the earth, that one cannot be able to see the earth: and they shall eat the residue of that which is escaped, which remaineth unto you from the hail, and shall eat every tree which groweth for you out of the field:  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>And they shall fill thy houses, and the houses of all thy servants, and the houses of all the Egyptians; which neither thy fathers, nor thy fathers’ fathers have seen, since the day that they were upon the earth unto this day. And he turned himself, and went out from Pharaoh.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>And Pharaoh’s servants said unto him, How long shall this man be a snare unto us? let the men go, that they may serve the LORD their God: knowest thou not yet that Egypt is destroyed?  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>And Moses and Aaron were brought again unto Pharaoh: and he said unto them, Go, serve the LORD your God: <span class='add'>but</span> who <span class='add'>are</span> they that shall go?  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>And Moses said, We will go with our young and with our old, with our sons and with our daughters, with our flocks and with our herds will we go; for we <span class='add'>must hold</span> a feast unto the LORD.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>And he said unto them, Let the LORD be so with you, as I will let you go, and your little ones: look <span class='add'>to it;</span> for evil <span class='add'>is</span> before you.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>Not so: go now ye <span class='add'>that are</span> men, and serve the LORD; for that ye did desire.
