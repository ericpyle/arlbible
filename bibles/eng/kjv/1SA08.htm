 <span class="verse" id="V1">1&nbsp;</span>And it came to pass, when Samuel was old, that he made his sons judges over Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span>Now the name of his firstborn was Joel; and the name of his second, Abiah: <span class='add'>they were</span> judges in Beer-sheba.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>And his sons walked not in his ways, but turned aside after lucre, and took bribes, and perverted judgment.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>Then all the elders of Israel gathered themselves together, and came to Samuel unto Ramah,  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>And said unto him, Behold, thou art old, and thy sons walk not in thy ways: now make us a king to judge us like all the nations. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>But the thing displeased Samuel, when they said, Give us a king to judge us. And Samuel prayed unto the LORD.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>And the LORD said unto Samuel, Hearken unto the voice of the people in all that they say unto thee: for they have not rejected thee, but they have rejected me, that I should not reign over them.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>According to all the works which they have done since the day that I brought them up out of Egypt even unto this day, wherewith they have forsaken me, and served other gods, so do they also unto thee.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>Now therefore hearken unto their voice: howbeit yet protest solemnly unto them, and shew them the manner of the king that shall reign over them. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>And Samuel told all the words of the LORD unto the people that asked of him a king.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>And he said, This will be the manner of the king that shall reign over you: He will take your sons, and appoint <span class='add'>them</span> for himself, for his chariots, and to be his horsemen; and <span class='add'>some</span> shall run before his chariots.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>And he will appoint him captains over thousands, and captains over fifties; and <span class='add'>will set them</span> to ear his ground, and to reap his harvest, and to make his instruments of war, and instruments of his chariots.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>And he will take your daughters <span class='add'>to be</span> confectionaries, and <span class='add'>to be</span> cooks, and <span class='add'>to be</span> bakers.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>And he will take your fields, and your vineyards, and your oliveyards, <span class='add'>even</span> the best <span class='add'>of them</span>, and give <span class='add'>them</span> to his servants.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>And he will take the tenth of your seed, and of your vineyards, and give to his officers, and to his servants.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>And he will take your menservants, and your maidservants, and your goodliest young men, and your asses, and put <span class='add'>them</span> to his work.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>He will take the tenth of your sheep: and ye shall be his servants.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>And ye shall cry out in that day because of your king which ye shall have chosen you; and the LORD will not hear you in that day. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>Nevertheless the people refused to obey the voice of Samuel; and they said, Nay; but we will have a king over us;  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>That we also may be like all the nations; and that our king may judge us, and go out before us, and fight our battles.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>And Samuel heard all the words of the people, and he rehearsed them in the ears of the LORD.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>And the LORD said to Samuel, Hearken unto their voice, and make them a king.
