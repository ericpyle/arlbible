 <span class="verse" id="V1">1&nbsp;</span>And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span>Again, thou shalt say to the children of Israel, Whosoever <span class='add'>he be</span> of the children of Israel, or of the strangers that sojourn in Israel, that giveth <span class='add'>any</span> of his seed unto Molech; he shall surely be put to death: the people of the land shall stone him with stones.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>And I will set my face against that man, and will cut him off from among his people; because he hath given of his seed unto Molech, to defile my sanctuary, and to profane my holy name.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>And if the people of the land do any ways hide their eyes from the man, when he giveth of his seed unto Molech, and kill him not:  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>Then I will set my face against that man, and against his family, and will cut him off, and all that go a whoring after him, to commit whoredom with Molech, from among their people. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>And the soul that turneth after such as have familiar spirits, and after wizards, to go a whoring after them, I will even set my face against that soul, and will cut him off from among his people. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>Sanctify yourselves therefore, and be ye holy: for I <span class='add'>am</span> the LORD your God.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>And ye shall keep my statutes, and do them: I <span class='add'>am</span> the LORD which sanctify you. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>For every one that curseth his father or his mother shall be surely put to death: he hath cursed his father or his mother; his blood <span class='add'>shall be</span> upon him. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>And the man that committeth adultery with <span class='add'>another</span> man’s wife, <span class='add'>even he</span> that committeth adultery with his neighbour’s wife, the adulterer and the adulteress shall surely be put to death.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>And the man that lieth with his father’s wife hath uncovered his father’s nakedness: both of them shall surely be put to death; their blood <span class='add'>shall be</span> upon them.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>And if a man lie with his daughter in law, both of them shall surely be put to death: they have wrought confusion; their blood <span class='add'>shall be</span> upon them.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>If a man also lie with mankind, as he lieth with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination: they shall surely be put to death; their blood <span class='add'>shall be</span> upon them.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>And if a man take a wife and her mother, it <span class='add'>is</span> wickedness: they shall be burnt with fire, both he and they; that there be no wickedness among you.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>And if a man lie with a beast, he shall surely be put to death: and ye shall slay the beast.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>And if a woman approach unto any beast, and lie down thereto, thou shalt kill the woman, and the beast: they shall surely be put to death; their blood <span class='add'>shall be</span> upon them.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>And if a man shall take his sister, his father’s daughter, or his mother’s daughter, and see her nakedness, and she see his nakedness; it <span class='add'>is</span> a wicked thing; and they shall be cut off in the sight of their people: he hath uncovered his sister’s nakedness; he shall bear his iniquity.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>And if a man shall lie with a woman having her sickness, and shall uncover her nakedness; he hath discovered her fountain, and she hath uncovered the fountain of her blood: and both of them shall be cut off from among their people.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>And thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy mother’s sister, nor of thy father’s sister: for he uncovereth his near kin: they shall bear their iniquity.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>And if a man shall lie with his uncle’s wife, he hath uncovered his uncle’s nakedness: they shall bear their sin; they shall die childless.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>And if a man shall take his brother’s wife, it <span class='add'>is</span> an unclean thing: he hath uncovered his brother’s nakedness;
