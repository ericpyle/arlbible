 <span class="verse" id="V1">1&nbsp;</span>And the ark of the LORD was in the country of the Philistines seven months.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span>And the Philistines called for the priests and the diviners, saying, What shall we do to the ark of the LORD? tell us wherewith we shall send it to his place.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>And they said, If ye send away the ark of the God of Israel, send it not empty; but in any wise return him a trespass offering: then ye shall be healed, and it shall be known to you why his hand is not removed from you.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>Then said they, What <span class='add'>shall be</span> the trespass offering which we shall return to him? They answered, Five golden emerods, and five golden mice, <span class='add'>according to</span> the number of the lords of the Philistines: for one plague was on you all, and on your lords.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>Wherefore ye shall make images of your emerods, and images of your mice that mar the land; and ye shall give glory unto the God of Israel: peradventure he will lighten his hand from off you, and from off your gods, and from off your land.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>Wherefore then do ye harden your hearts, as the Egyptians and Pharaoh hardened their hearts? when he had wrought wonderfully among them, did they not let the people go, and they departed?  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>Now therefore make a new cart, and take two milch kine, on which there hath come no yoke, and tie the kine to the cart, and bring their calves home from them:  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>And take the ark of the LORD, and lay it upon the cart; and put the jewels of gold, which ye return him <span class='add'>for</span> a trespass offering, in a coffer by the side thereof; and send it away, that it may go.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>And see, if it goeth up by the way of his own coast to Beth-shemesh, <span class='add'>then</span> he hath done us this great evil: but if not, then we shall know that <span class='add'>it is</span> not his hand <span class='add'>that</span> smote us; it <span class='add'>was</span> a chance <span class='add'>that</span> happened to us. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>And the men did so; and took two milch kine, and tied them to the cart, and shut up their calves at home:  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>And they laid the ark of the LORD upon the cart, and the coffer with the mice of gold and the images of their emerods.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>And the kine took the straight way to the way of Beth-shemesh, <span class='add'>and</span> went along the highway, lowing as they went, and turned not aside <span class='add'>to</span> the right hand or <span class='add'>to</span> the left; and the lords of the Philistines went after them unto the border of Beth-shemesh.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>And <span class='add'>they of</span> Beth-shemesh <span class='add'>were</span> reaping their wheat harvest in the valley: and they lifted up their eyes, and saw the ark, and rejoiced to see <span class='add'>it</span>.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>And the cart came into the field of Joshua, a Beth-shemite, and stood there, where <span class='add'>there was</span> a great stone: and they clave the wood of the cart, and offered the kine a burnt offering unto the LORD.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>And the Levites took down the ark of the LORD, and the coffer that <span class='add'>was</span> with it, wherein the jewels of gold <span class='add'>were</span>, and put <span class='add'>them</span> on the great stone: and the men of Beth-shemesh offered burnt offerings and sacrificed sacrifices the same day unto the LORD.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>And when the five lords of the Philistines had seen <span class='add'>it</span>, they returned to Ekron the same day.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>And these <span class='add'>are</span> the golden emerods which the Philistines returned <span class='add'>for</span> a trespass offering unto the LORD; for Ashdod one, for Gaza one, for Askelon one, for Gath one, for Ekron one;  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>And the golden mice, <span class='add'>according to</span> the number of all the cities of the Philistines <span class='add'>belonging</span> to the five lords, <span class='add'>both</span> of fenced cities, and of country villages, even unto the great <span class='add'>stone</span> of Abel, whereon they set down the ark of the LORD: <span class='add'>which stone remaineth</span> unto this day in the field of Joshua, the Beth-shemite. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>And he smote the men of Beth-shemesh, because they had looked into the ark of the LORD, even he smote of the people fifty thousand and threescore and ten men: and the people lamented, because the LORD had smitten <span class='add'>many</span> of the people with a great slaughter.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>And the men of Beth-shemesh said, Who is able to stand before this holy LORD God? and to whom shall he go up from us? </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>And they sent messengers to the inhabitants of Kirjath-jearim, saying, The Philistines have brought again the ark of the LORD; come ye down, <span class='add'>and</span> fetch it up to you. </div><ul class='tnav'>
