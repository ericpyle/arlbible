 <span class="verse" id="V1">1&nbsp;</span>The proverbs of Solomon. A wise son maketh a glad father: but a foolish son <span class='add'>is</span> the heaviness of his mother.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span>Treasures of wickedness profit nothing: but righteousness delivereth from death.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>The LORD will not suffer the soul of the righteous to famish: but he casteth away the substance of the wicked.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>He becometh poor that dealeth <span class='add'>with</span> a slack hand: but the hand of the diligent maketh rich.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>He that gathereth in summer <span class='add'>is</span> a wise son: <span class='add'>but</span> he that sleepeth in harvest <span class='add'>is</span> a son that causeth shame.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>Blessings <span class='add'>are</span> upon the head of the just: but violence covereth the mouth of the wicked.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>The memory of the just is blessed: but the name of the wicked shall rot.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>The wise in heart will receive commandments: but a prating fool shall fall.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>He that walketh uprightly walketh surely: but he that perverteth his ways shall be known.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>He that winketh with the eye causeth sorrow: but a prating fool shall fall.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>The mouth of a righteous <span class='add'>man is</span> a well of life: but violence covereth the mouth of the wicked.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>Hatred stirreth up strifes: but love covereth all sins.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>In the lips of him that hath understanding wisdom is found: but a rod <span class='add'>is</span> for the back of him that is void of understanding.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>Wise <span class='add'>men</span> lay up knowledge: but the mouth of the foolish <span class='add'>is</span> near destruction.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>The rich man’s wealth <span class='add'>is</span> his strong city: the destruction of the poor <span class='add'>is</span> their poverty.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>The labour of the righteous <span class='add'>tendeth</span> to life: the fruit of the wicked to sin.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>He <span class='add'>is in</span> the way of life that keepeth instruction: but he that refuseth reproof erreth.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>He that hideth hatred <span class='add'>with</span> lying lips, and he that uttereth a slander, <span class='add'>is</span> a fool.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>In the multitude of words there wanteth not sin: but he that refraineth his lips <span class='add'>is</span> wise.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>The tongue of the just <span class='add'>is as</span> choice silver: the heart of the wicked <span class='add'>is</span> little worth.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>The lips of the righteous feed many: but fools die for want of wisdom.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>The blessing of the LORD, it maketh rich, and he addeth no sorrow with it.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span> <span class='add'>It is</span> as sport to a fool to do mischief: but a man of understanding hath wisdom.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>The fear of the wicked, it shall come upon him: but the desire of the righteous shall be granted.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>As the whirlwind passeth, so <span class='add'>is</span> the wicked no <span class='add'>more:</span> but the righteous <span class='add'>is</span> an everlasting foundation.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>As vinegar to the teeth, and as smoke to the eyes, so <span class='add'>is</span> the sluggard to them that send him.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>The fear of the LORD prolongeth days: but the years of the wicked shall be shortened.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&nbsp;</span>The hope of the righteous <span class='add'>shall be</span> gladness: but the expectation of the wicked shall perish.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&nbsp;</span>The way of the LORD <span class='add'>is</span> strength to the upright: but destruction <span class='add'>shall be</span> to the workers of iniquity.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&nbsp;</span>The righteous shall never be removed: but the wicked shall not inhabit the earth.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&nbsp;</span>The mouth of the just bringeth forth wisdom: but the froward tongue shall be cut out.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&nbsp;</span>The lips of the righteous know what is acceptable: but the mouth of the wicked <span class='add'>speaketh</span> frowardness. </div><ul class='tnav'>
