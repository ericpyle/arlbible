Moreover I will subdue all thine enemies. Furthermore I tell thee that the LORD will build thee an house. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>And it shall come to pass, when thy days be expired that thou must go <span class='add'>to be</span> with thy fathers, that I will raise up thy seed after thee, which shall be of thy sons; and I will establish his kingdom.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>He shall build me an house, and I will stablish his throne for ever.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>I will be his father, and he shall be my son: and I will not take my mercy away from him, as I took <span class='add'>it</span> from <span class='add'>him</span> that was before thee:  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>But I will settle him in mine house and in my kingdom for ever: and his throne shall be established for evermore.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so did Nathan speak unto David. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>And David the king came and sat before the LORD, and said, Who <span class='add'>am</span> I, O LORD God, and what <span class='add'>is</span> mine house, that thou hast brought me hitherto?  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>And <span class='add'>yet</span> this was a small thing in thine eyes, O God; for thou hast <span class='add'>also</span> spoken of thy servant’s house for a great while to come, and hast regarded me according to the estate of a man of high degree, O LORD God.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>What can David <span class='add'>speak</span> more to thee for the honour of thy servant? for thou knowest thy servant.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>O LORD, for thy servant’s sake, and according to thine own heart, hast thou done all this greatness, in making known all these great things.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>O LORD, <span class='add'>there is</span> none like thee, neither <span class='add'>is there any</span> God beside thee, according to all that we have heard with our ears.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>And what one nation in the earth <span class='add'>is</span> like thy people Israel, whom God went to redeem <span class='add'>to be</span> his own people, to make thee a name of greatness and terribleness, by driving out nations from before thy people, whom thou hast redeemed out of Egypt?  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>For thy people Israel didst thou make thine own people for ever; and thou, LORD, becamest their God.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>Therefore now, LORD, let the thing that thou hast spoken concerning thy servant and concerning his house be established for ever, and do as thou hast said.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>Let it even be established, that thy name may be magnified for ever, saying, The LORD of hosts <span class='add'>is</span> the God of Israel, <span class='add'>even</span> a God to Israel: and <span class='add'>let</span> the house of David thy servant <span class='add'>be</span> established before thee.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>For thou, O my God, hast told thy servant that thou wilt build him an house: therefore thy servant hath found <span class='add'>in his heart</span> to pray before thee.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>And now, LORD, thou art God, and hast promised this goodness unto thy servant:  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>Now therefore let it please thee to bless the house of thy servant, that it may be before thee for ever: for thou blessest, O LORD, and <span class='add'>it shall be</span> blessed for ever. </div><ul class='tnav'>
