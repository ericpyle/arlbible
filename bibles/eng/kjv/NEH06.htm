 <span class="verse" id="V1">1&nbsp;</span>Now it came to pass, when Sanballat, and Tobiah, and Geshem the Arabian, and the rest of our enemies, heard that I had builded the wall, and <span class='add'>that</span> there was no breach left therein; (though at that time I had not set up the doors upon the gates;)  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span>That Sanballat and Geshem sent unto me, saying, Come, let us meet together in <span class='add'>some one of</span> the villages in the plain of Ono. But they thought to do me mischief.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>And I sent messengers unto them, saying, I <span class='add'>am</span> doing a great work, so that I cannot come down: why should the work cease, whilst I leave it, and come down to you?  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>Yet they sent unto me four times after this sort; and I answered them after the same manner.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>Then sent Sanballat his servant unto me in like manner the fifth time with an open letter in his hand;  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>Wherein <span class='add'>was</span> written, It is reported among the heathen, and Gashmu saith <span class='add'>it, that</span> thou and the Jews think to rebel: for which cause thou buildest the wall, that thou mayest be their king, according to these words.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>And thou hast also appointed prophets to preach of thee at Jerusalem, saying, <span class='add'>There is</span> a king in Judah: and now shall it be reported to the king according to these words. Come now therefore, and let us take counsel together.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>Then I sent unto him, saying, There are no such things done as thou sayest, but thou feignest them out of thine own heart.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>For they all made us afraid, saying, Their hands shall be weakened from the work, that it be not done. Now therefore, <span class='add'>O God</span>, strengthen my hands.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>Afterward I came unto the house of Shemaiah the son of Delaiah the son of Mehetabeel, who <span class='add'>was</span> shut up; and he said, Let us meet together in the house of God, within the temple, and let us shut the doors of the temple: for they will come to slay thee; yea, in the night will they come to slay thee.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>And I said, Should such a man as I flee? and who <span class='add'>is there</span>, that, <span class='add'>being</span> as I <span class='add'>am</span>, would go into the temple to save his life? I will not go in.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>And, lo, I perceived that God had not sent him; but that he pronounced this prophecy against me: for Tobiah and Sanballat had hired him.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>Therefore <span class='add'>was</span> he hired, that I should be afraid, and do so, and sin, and <span class='add'>that</span> they might have <span class='add'>matter</span> for an evil report, that they might reproach me.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>My God, think thou upon Tobiah and Sanballat according to these their works, and on the prophetess Noadiah, and the rest of the prophets, that would have put me in fear. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>So the wall was finished in the twenty and fifth <span class='add'>day</span> of <span class='add'>the month</span> Elul, in fifty and two days.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>And it came to pass, that when all our enemies heard <span class='add'>thereof</span>, and all the heathen that <span class='add'>were</span> about us saw <span class='add'>these things</span>, they were much cast down in their own eyes: for they perceived that this work was wrought of our God. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>Moreover in those days the nobles of Judah sent many letters unto Tobiah, and <span class='add'>the letters</span> of Tobiah came unto them.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>For <span class='add'>there were</span> many in Judah sworn unto him, because he <span class='add'>was</span> the son in law of Shechaniah the son of Arah; and his son Johanan had taken the daughter of Meshullam the son of Berechiah.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>Also they reported his good deeds before me, and uttered my words to him. <span class='add'>And</span> Tobiah sent letters to put me in fear. </div><ul class='tnav'>
