 <span class="verse" id="V1">1&nbsp;</span>And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span>Speak unto Aaron and to his sons, that they separate themselves from the holy things of the children of Israel, and that they profane not my holy name <span class='add'>in those things</span> which they hallow unto me: I <span class='add'>am</span> the LORD.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>Say unto them, Whosoever <span class='add'>he be</span> of all your seed among your generations, that goeth unto the holy things, which the children of Israel hallow unto the LORD, having his uncleanness upon him, that soul shall be cut off from my presence: I <span class='add'>am</span> the LORD.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>What man soever of the seed of Aaron <span class='add'>is</span> a leper, or hath a running issue; he shall not eat of the holy things, until he be clean. And whoso toucheth any thing <span class='add'>that is</span> unclean <span class='add'>by</span> the dead, or a man whose seed goeth from him;  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>Or whosoever toucheth any creeping thing, whereby he may be made unclean, or a man of whom he may take uncleanness, whatsoever uncleanness he hath;  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>The soul which hath touched any such shall be unclean until even, and shall not eat of the holy things, unless he wash his flesh with water.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>And when the sun is down, he shall be clean, and shall afterward eat of the holy things; because it <span class='add'>is</span> his food.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>That which dieth of itself, or is torn <span class='add'>with beasts</span>, he shall not eat to defile himself therewith: I <span class='add'>am</span> the LORD.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>They shall therefore keep mine ordinance, lest they bear sin for it, and die therefore, if they profane it: I the LORD do sanctify them.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>There shall no stranger eat <span class='add'>of</span> the holy thing: a sojourner of the priest, or an hired servant, shall not eat <span class='add'>of</span> the holy thing.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>But if the priest buy <span class='add'>any</span> soul with his money, he shall eat of it, and he that is born in his house: they shall eat of his meat.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>If the priest’s daughter also be <span class='add'>married</span> unto a stranger, she may not eat of an offering of the holy things.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>But if the priest’s daughter be a widow, or divorced, and have no child, and is returned unto her father’s house, as in her youth, she shall eat of her father’s meat: but there shall no stranger eat thereof. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>And if a man eat <span class='add'>of</span> the holy thing unwittingly, then he shall put the fifth <span class='add'>part</span> thereof unto it, and shall give <span class='add'>it</span> unto the priest with the holy thing.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>And they shall not profane the holy things of the children of Israel, which they offer unto the LORD;

 <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span> <span class='add'>Ye shall offer</span> at your own will a male without blemish, of the beeves, of the sheep, or of the goats.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span> <span class='add'>But</span> whatsoever hath a blemish, <span class='add'>that</span> shall ye not offer: for it shall not be acceptable for you.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>And whosoever offereth a sacrifice of peace offerings unto the LORD to accomplish <span class='add'>his</span> vow, or a freewill offering in beeves or sheep, it shall be perfect to be accepted;
