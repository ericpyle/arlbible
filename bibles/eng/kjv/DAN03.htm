 <span class="verse" id="V1">1&nbsp;</span>Nebuchadnezzar the king made an image of gold, whose height <span class='add'>was</span> threescore cubits, <span class='add'>and</span> the breadth thereof six cubits: he set it up in the plain of Dura, in the province of Babylon.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span>Then Nebuchadnezzar the king sent to gather together the princes, the governors, and the captains, the judges, the treasurers, the counsellors, the sheriffs, and all the rulers of the provinces, to come to the dedication of the image which Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>Then the princes, the governors, and captains, the judges, the treasurers, the counsellors, the sheriffs, and all the rulers of the provinces, were gathered together unto the dedication of the image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up; and they stood before the image that Nebuchadnezzar had set up.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>Then an herald cried aloud, To you it is commanded, O people, nations, and languages,  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span> <span class='add'>That</span> at what time ye hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, dulcimer, and all kinds of musick, ye fall down and worship the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king hath set up:  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>And whoso falleth not down and worshippeth shall the same hour be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>Therefore at that time, when all the people heard the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and all kinds of musick, all the people, the nations, and the languages, fell down <span class='add'>and</span> worshipped the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>Wherefore at that time certain Chaldeans came near, and accused the Jews.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>They spake and said to the king Nebuchadnezzar, O king, live for ever.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>Thou, O king, hast made a decree, that every man that shall hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and dulcimer, and all kinds of musick, shall fall down and worship the golden image:  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>And whoso falleth not down and worshippeth, <span class='add'>that</span> he should be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>There are certain Jews whom thou hast set over the affairs of the province of Babylon, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego; these men, O king, have not regarded thee: they serve not thy gods, nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>Then Nebuchadnezzar in <span class='add'>his</span> rage and fury commanded to bring Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego.

They answered and said unto the king, True, O king.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>He answered and said, Lo, I see four men loose, walking in the midst of the fire, and they have no hurt; and the form of the fourth is like the Son of God. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>Then Nebuchadnezzar came near to the mouth of the burning fiery furnace, <span class='add'>and</span> spake, and said, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, ye servants of the most high God, come forth, and come <span class='add'>hither</span>. Then Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, came forth of the midst of the fire.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>And the princes, governors, and captains, and the king’s counsellors, being gathered together, saw these men, upon whose bodies the fire had no power, nor was an hair of their head singed, neither were their coats changed, nor the smell of fire had passed on them.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&nbsp;</span> <span class='add'>Then</span> Nebuchadnezzar spake, and said, Blessed <span class='add'>be</span> the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, who hath sent his angel, and delivered his servants that trusted in him, and have changed the king’s word, and yielded their bodies, that they might not serve nor worship any god, except their own God.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&nbsp;</span>Therefore I make a decree, That every people, nation, and language, which speak any thing amiss against the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, shall be cut in pieces, and their houses shall be made a dunghill: because there is no other God that can deliver after this sort.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&nbsp;</span>Then the king promoted Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, in the province of Babylon. </div><ul class='tnav'>
