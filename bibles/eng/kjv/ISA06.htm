 <span class="verse" id="V1">1&nbsp;</span>In the year that king Uzziah died I saw also the Lord sitting upon a throne, high and lifted up, and his train filled the temple.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span>Above it stood the seraphims: each one had six wings; with twain he covered his face, and with twain he covered his feet, and with twain he did fly.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>And one cried unto another, and said, Holy, holy, holy, <span class='add'>is</span> the LORD of hosts: the whole earth <span class='add'>is</span> full of his glory.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>And the posts of the door moved at the voice of him that cried, and the house was filled with smoke. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>Then said I, Woe <span class='add'>is</span> me! for I am undone; because I <span class='add'>am</span> a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips: for mine eyes have seen the King, the LORD of hosts.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>Then flew one of the seraphims unto me, having a live coal in his hand, <span class='add'>which</span> he had taken with the tongs from off the altar:  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>And he laid <span class='add'>it</span> upon my mouth, and said, Lo, this hath touched thy lips; and thine iniquity is taken away, and thy sin purged.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>Also I heard the voice of the Lord, saying, Whom shall I send, and who will go for us? Then said I, Here <span class='add'>am</span> I; send me. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>And he said, Go, and tell this people, Hear ye indeed, but understand not; and see ye indeed, but perceive not.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>Make the heart of this people fat, and make their ears heavy, and shut their eyes; lest they see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and convert, and be healed.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>Then said I, Lord, how long? And he answered, Until the cities be wasted without inhabitant, and the houses without man, and the land be utterly desolate,  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>And the LORD have removed men far away, and <span class='add'>there be</span> a great forsaking in the midst of the land. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>But yet in it <span class='add'>shall be</span> a tenth, and <span class='add'>it</span> shall return, and shall be eaten: as a teil tree, and as an oak, whose substance is in them, when they cast <span class='add'>their leaves: so</span> the holy seed <span class='add'>shall be</span> the substance thereof. </div><ul class='tnav'>
