And the LORD said to Hosea, Go, take unto thee a wife of whoredoms and children of whoredoms: for the land hath committed great whoredom, <span class='add'>departing</span> from the LORD.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>So he went and took Gomer the daughter of Diblaim; which conceived, and bare him a son.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>And the LORD said unto him, Call his name Jezreel; for yet a little <span class='add'>while</span>, and I will avenge the blood of Jezreel upon the house of Jehu, and will cause to cease the kingdom of the house of Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>And it shall come to pass at that day, that I will break the bow of Israel in the valley of Jezreel. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>And she conceived again, and bare a daughter.
