 <span class="verse" id="V1">1&nbsp;</span>Hear ye the word which the LORD speaketh unto you, O house of Israel:  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span>Thus saith the LORD, Learn not the way of the heathen, and be not dismayed at the signs of heaven; for the heathen are dismayed at them.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>For the customs of the people <span class='add'>are</span> vain: for <span class='add'>one</span> cutteth a tree out of the forest, the work of the hands of the workman, with the axe.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>They deck it with silver and with gold; they fasten it with nails and with hammers, that it move not.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>They <span class='add'>are</span> upright as the palm tree, but speak not: they must needs be borne, because they cannot go. Be not afraid of them; for they cannot do evil, neither also <span class='add'>is it</span> in them to do good.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>Forasmuch as <span class='add'>there is</span> none like unto thee, O LORD; thou <span class='add'>art</span> great, and thy name is great in might.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>Who would not fear thee, O King of nations? for to thee doth it appertain: forasmuch as among all the wise <span class='add'>men</span> of the nations, and in all their kingdoms, <span class='add'>there is</span> none like unto thee.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>But they are altogether brutish and foolish: the stock <span class='add'>is</span> a doctrine of vanities.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>Silver spread into plates is brought from Tarshish, and gold from Uphaz, the work of the workman, and of the hands of the founder: blue and purple is their clothing: they <span class='add'>are</span> all the work of cunning <span class='add'>men</span>.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>But the LORD <span class='add'>is</span> the true God, he <span class='add'>is</span> the living God, and an everlasting king: at his wrath the earth shall tremble, and the nations shall not be able to abide his indignation.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>Thus shall ye say unto them, The gods that have not made the heavens and the earth, <span class='add'>even</span> they shall perish from the earth, and from under these heavens.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>He hath made the earth by his power, he hath established the world by his wisdom, and hath stretched out the heavens by his discretion.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>When he uttereth his voice, <span class='add'>there is</span> a multitude of waters in the heavens, and he causeth the vapors to ascend from the ends of the earth; he maketh lightnings with rain, and bringeth forth the wind out of his treasures.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>Every man is brutish in <span class='add'>his</span> knowledge: every founder is confounded by the graven image: for his molten image is falsehood, and <span class='add'>there is</span> no breath in them.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>They <span class='add'>are</span> vanity, <span class='add'>and</span> the work of errors: in the time of their visitation they shall perish.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>The portion of Jacob <span class='add'>is</span> not like them: for he <span class='add'>is</span> the former of all <span class='add'>things;</span> and Israel <span class='add'>is</span> the rod of his inheritance: The LORD of hosts <span class='add'>is</span> his name. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>Gather up thy wares out of the land, O inhabitant of the fortress.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>For thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will sling out the inhabitants of the land at this once, and will distress them, that they may find <span class='add'>it</span> so. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>Woe is me for my hurt! my wound is grievous: but I said, Truly this <span class='add'>is</span> a grief, and I must bear it.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>My tabernacle is spoiled, and all my cords are broken: my children are gone forth of me, and they <span class='add'>are</span> not: <span class='add'>there is</span> none to stretch forth my tent any more, and to set up my curtains.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>For the pastors are become brutish, and have not sought the LORD: therefore they shall not prosper, and all their flocks shall be scattered.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>Behold, the noise of the bruit is come, and a great commotion out of the north country, to make the cities of Judah desolate, <span class='add'>and</span> a den of dragons. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>O LORD, I know that the way of man <span class='add'>is</span> not in himself: <span class='add'>it is</span> not in man that walketh to direct his steps.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>O LORD, correct me, but with judgment; not in thine anger, lest thou bring me to nothing.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>Pour out thy fury upon the heathen that know thee not, and upon the families that call not on thy name: for they have eaten up Jacob, and devoured him, and consumed him, and have made his habitation desolate. </div><ul class='tnav'>
