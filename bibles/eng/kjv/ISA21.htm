 <span class="verse" id="V1">1&nbsp;</span>The burden of the desert of the sea. As whirlwinds in the south pass through; <span class='add'>so</span> it cometh from the desert, from a terrible land.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span>A grievous vision is declared unto me; the treacherous dealer dealeth treacherously, and the spoiler spoileth. Go up, O Elam: besiege, O Media; all the sighing thereof have I made to cease.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>Therefore are my loins filled with pain: pangs have taken hold upon me, as the pangs of a woman that travaileth: I was bowed down at the hearing <span class='add'>of it;</span> I was dismayed at the seeing <span class='add'>of it</span>.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>My heart panted, fearfulness affrighted me: the night of my pleasure hath he turned into fear unto me.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>Prepare the table, watch in the watchtower, eat, drink: arise, ye princes, <span class='add'>and</span> anoint the shield.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>For thus hath the Lord said unto me, Go, set a watchman, let him declare what he seeth.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>And he saw a chariot <span class='add'>with</span> a couple of horsemen, a chariot of asses, <span class='add'>and</span> a chariot of camels; and he hearkened diligently with much heed:  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>And he cried, A lion: My lord, I stand continually upon the watchtower in the daytime, and I am set in my ward whole nights:  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>And, behold, here cometh a chariot of men, <span class='add'>with</span> a couple of horsemen. And he answered and said, Babylon is fallen, is fallen; and all the graven images of her gods he hath broken unto the ground.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>O my threshing, and the corn of my floor: that which I have heard of the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, have I declared unto you. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>The burden of Dumah. He calleth to me out of Seir, Watchman, what of the night? Watchman, what of the night?  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>The watchman said, The morning cometh, and also the night: if ye will enquire, enquire ye: return, come. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>The burden upon Arabia. In the forest in Arabia shall ye lodge, O ye travelling companies of Dedanim.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>The inhabitants of the land of Tema brought water to him that was thirsty, they prevented with their bread him that fled.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>For they fled from the swords, from the drawn sword, and from the bent bow, and from the grievousness of war.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>For thus hath the Lord said unto me, Within a year, according to the years of an hireling, and all the glory of Kedar shall fail:  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>And the residue of the number of archers, the mighty men of the children of Kedar, shall be diminished: for the LORD God of Israel hath spoken <span class='add'>it</span>. </div><ul class='tnav'>
