 <span class="verse" id="V1">1&nbsp;</span>These <span class='add'>are</span> also proverbs of Solomon, which the men of Hezekiah king of Judah copied out.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span> <span class='add'>It is</span> the glory of God to conceal a thing: but the honour of kings <span class='add'>is</span> to search out a matter.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>The heaven for height, and the earth for depth, and the heart of kings <span class='add'>is</span> unsearchable.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>Take away the dross from the silver, and there shall come forth a vessel for the finer.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>Take away the wicked <span class='add'>from</span> before the king, and his throne shall be established in righteousness.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>Put not forth thyself in the presence of the king, and stand not in the place of great <span class='add'>men:</span>  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>For better <span class='add'>it is</span> that it be said unto thee, Come up hither; than that thou shouldest be put lower in the presence of the prince whom thine eyes have seen.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>Go not forth hastily to strive, lest <span class='add'>thou know not</span> what to do in the end thereof, when thy neighbour hath put thee to shame.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>Debate thy cause with thy neighbour <span class='add'>himself;</span> and discover not a secret to another:  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>Lest he that heareth <span class='add'>it</span> put thee to shame, and thine infamy turn not away.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>A word fitly spoken <span class='add'>is like</span> apples of gold in pictures of silver.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span> <span class='add'>As</span> an earring of gold, and an ornament of fine gold, <span class='add'>so is</span> a wise reprover upon an obedient ear.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>As the cold of snow in the time of harvest, <span class='add'>so is</span> a faithful messenger to them that send him: for he refresheth the soul of his masters.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>Whoso boasteth himself of a false gift <span class='add'>is like</span> clouds and wind without rain.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>By long forbearing is a prince persuaded, and a soft tongue breaketh the bone.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>Hast thou found honey? eat so much as is sufficient for thee, lest thou be filled therewith, and vomit it.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>Withdraw thy foot from thy neighbour’s house; lest he be weary of thee, and <span class='add'>so</span> hate thee.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>A man that beareth false witness against his neighbour <span class='add'>is</span> a maul, and a sword, and a sharp arrow.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>Confidence in an unfaithful man in time of trouble <span class='add'>is like</span> a broken tooth, and a foot out of joint.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span> <span class='add'>As</span> he that taketh away a garment in cold weather, <span class='add'>and as</span> vinegar upon nitre, so <span class='add'>is</span> he that singeth songs to an heavy heart.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>If thine enemy be hungry, give him bread to eat; and if he be thirsty, give him water to drink:  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>For thou shalt heap coals of fire upon his head, and the LORD shall reward thee.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>The north wind driveth away rain: so <span class='add'>doth</span> an angry countenance a backbiting tongue.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span> <span class='add'>It is</span> better to dwell in the corner of the housetop, than with a brawling woman and in a wide house.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span> <span class='add'>As</span> cold waters to a thirsty soul, so <span class='add'>is</span> good news from a far country.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>A righteous man falling down before the wicked <span class='add'>is as</span> a troubled fountain, and a corrupt spring.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span> <span class='add'>It is</span>not good to eat much honey: so <span class='add'>for men</span>to search their own glory <span class='add'>is not</span>glory.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&nbsp;</span>He that <span class='add'>hath</span> no rule over his own spirit <span class='add'>is like</span> a city <span class='add'>that is</span> broken down, <span class='add'>and</span> without walls. </div><ul class='tnav'>
