 <span class="verse" id="V1">1&nbsp;</span>The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD, saying,  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span>Thus speaketh the LORD God of Israel, saying, Write thee all the words that I have spoken unto thee in a book.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>For, lo, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will bring again the captivity of my people Israel and Judah, saith the LORD: and I will cause them to return to the land that I gave to their fathers, and they shall possess it. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>And these <span class='add'>are</span> the words that the LORD spake concerning Israel and concerning Judah.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>For thus saith the LORD; We have heard a voice of trembling, of fear, and not of peace.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>Ask ye now, and see whether a man doth travail with child? wherefore do I see every man with his hands on his loins, as a woman in travail, and all faces are turned into paleness?  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>Alas! for that day <span class='add'>is</span> great, so that none <span class='add'>is</span> like it: it <span class='add'>is</span> even the time of Jacob’s trouble; but he shall be saved out of it.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>For it shall come to pass in that day, saith the LORD of hosts, <span class='add'>that</span> I will break his yoke from off thy neck, and will burst thy bonds, and strangers shall no more serve themselves of him:  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>But they shall serve the LORD their God, and David their king, whom I will raise up unto them. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>Therefore fear thou not, O my servant Jacob, saith the LORD; neither be dismayed, O Israel: for, lo, I will save thee from afar, and thy seed from the land of their captivity; and Jacob shall return, and shall be in rest, and be quiet, and none shall make <span class='add'>him</span> afraid.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>For I <span class='add'>am</span> with thee, saith the LORD, to save thee: though I make a full end of all nations whither I have scattered thee, yet will I not make a full end of thee: but I will correct thee in measure, and will not leave thee altogether unpunished.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>For thus saith the LORD, Thy bruise <span class='add'>is</span> incurable, <span class='add'>and</span> thy wound <span class='add'>is</span> grievous.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span> <span class='add'>There is</span> none to plead thy cause, that thou mayest be bound up: thou hast no healing medicines.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>All thy lovers have forgotten thee; they seek thee not; for I have wounded thee with the wound of an enemy, with the chastisement of a cruel one, for the multitude of thine iniquity; <span class='add'>because</span> thy sins were increased.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>Why criest thou for thine affliction? thy sorrow <span class='add'>is</span> incurable for the multitude of thine iniquity: <span class='add'>because</span> thy sins were increased, I have done these things unto thee.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>Therefore all they that devour thee shall be devoured; and all thine adversaries, every one of them, shall go into captivity; and they that spoil thee shall be a spoil, and all that prey upon thee will I give for a prey.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>For I will restore health unto thee, and I will heal thee of thy wounds, saith the LORD; because they called thee an Outcast, <span class='add'>saying</span>, This <span class='add'>is</span> Zion, whom no man seeketh after. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>Thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will bring again the captivity of Jacob’s tents, and have mercy on his dwellingplaces; and the city shall be builded upon her own heap, and the palace shall remain after the manner thereof.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>And out of them shall proceed thanksgiving and the voice of them that make merry: and I will multiply them, and they shall not be few; I will also glorify them, and they shall not be small.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>Their children also shall be as aforetime, and their congregation shall be established before me, and I will punish all that oppress them.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>And their nobles shall be of themselves, and their governor shall proceed from the midst of them; and I will cause him to draw near, and he shall approach unto me: for who <span class='add'>is</span> this that engaged his heart to approach unto me? saith the LORD.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>And ye shall be my people, and I will be your God.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>Behold, the whirlwind of the LORD goeth forth with fury, a continuing whirlwind: it shall fall with pain upon the head of the wicked.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>The fierce anger of the LORD shall not return, until he have done <span class='add'>it</span>, and until he have performed the intents of his heart: in the latter days ye shall consider it. </div><ul class='tnav'>
