 <span class="verse" id="V1">1&nbsp;</span>The word of the LORD that came to Micah the Morasthite in the days of Jotham, Ahaz, <span class='add'>and</span> Hezekiah, kings of Judah, which he saw concerning Samaria and Jerusalem.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span>Hear, all ye people; hearken, O earth, and all that therein is: and let the Lord GOD be witness against you, the Lord from his holy temple.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>For, behold, the LORD cometh forth out of his place, and will come down, and tread upon the high places of the earth.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>And the mountains shall be molten under him, and the valleys shall be cleft, as wax before the fire, <span class='add'>and</span> as the waters <span class='add'>that are</span> poured down a steep place.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>For the transgression of Jacob <span class='add'>is</span> all this, and for the sins of the house of Israel. What <span class='add'>is</span> the transgression of Jacob? <span class='add'>is it</span> not Samaria? and what <span class='add'>are</span> the high places of Judah? <span class='add'>are they</span> not Jerusalem?  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>Therefore I will make Samaria as an heap of the field, <span class='add'>and</span> as plantings of a vineyard: and I will pour down the stones thereof into the valley, and I will discover the foundations thereof.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>And all the graven images thereof shall be beaten to pieces, and all the hires thereof shall be burned with the fire, and all the idols thereof will I lay desolate: for she gathered <span class='add'>it</span> of the hire of an harlot, and they shall return to the hire of an harlot.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>Therefore I will wail and howl, I will go stripped and naked: I will make a wailing like the dragons, and mourning as the owls.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>For her wound <span class='add'>is</span> incurable; for it is come unto Judah; he is come unto the gate of my people, <span class='add'>even</span> to Jerusalem. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>Declare ye <span class='add'>it</span> not at Gath, weep ye not at all: in the house of Aphrah roll thyself in the dust.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>Pass ye away, thou inhabitant of Saphir, having thy shame naked: the inhabitant of Zaanan came not forth in the mourning of Beth-ezel; he shall receive of you his standing.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>For the inhabitant of Maroth waited carefully for good: but evil came down from the LORD unto the gate of Jerusalem.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>O thou inhabitant of Lachish, bind the chariot to the swift beast: she <span class='add'>is</span> the beginning of the sin to the daughter of Zion: for the transgressions of Israel were found in thee.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>Therefore shalt thou give presents to Moresheth-gath: the houses of Achzib <span class='add'>shall be</span> a lie to the kings of Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>Yet will I bring an heir unto thee, O inhabitant of Mareshah: he shall come unto Adullam the glory of Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>Make thee bald, and poll thee for thy delicate children; enlarge thy baldness as the eagle; for they are gone into captivity from thee. </div><ul class='tnav'>
