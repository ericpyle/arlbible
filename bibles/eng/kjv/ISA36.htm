 <span class="verse" id="V1">1&nbsp;</span>Now it came to pass in the fourteenth year of king Hezekiah, <span class='add'>that</span> Sennacherib king of Assyria came up against all the defenced cities of Judah, and took them.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span>And the king of Assyria sent Rabshakeh from Lachish to Jerusalem unto king Hezekiah with a great army. And he stood by the conduit of the upper pool in the highway of the fuller’s field.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>Then came forth unto him Eliakim, Hilkiah’s son, which was over the house, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah, Asaph’s son, the recorder. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>And Rabshakeh said unto them, Say ye now to Hezekiah, Thus saith the great king, the king of Assyria, What confidence is this wherein thou trustest?  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>I say, <span class='add'>sayest thou</span>, (but <span class='add'>they are but</span> vain words) <span class='add'>I have</span> counsel and strength for war: now on whom dost thou trust, that thou rebellest against me?  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>Lo, thou trustest in the staff of this broken reed, on Egypt; whereon if a man lean, it will go into his hand, and pierce it: so <span class='add'>is</span> Pharaoh king of Egypt to all that trust in him.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>But if thou say to me, We trust in the LORD our God: <span class='add'>is it</span> not he, whose high places and whose altars Hezekiah hath taken away, and said to Judah and to Jerusalem, Ye shall worship before this altar?  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>Now therefore give pledges, I pray thee, to my master the king of Assyria, and I will give thee two thousand horses, if thou be able on thy part to set riders upon them.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>How then wilt thou turn away the face of one captain of the least of my master’s servants, and put thy trust on Egypt for chariots and for horsemen?  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>And am I now come up without the LORD against this land to destroy it? the LORD said unto me, Go up against this land, and destroy it. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>Then said Eliakim and Shebna and Joah unto Rabshakeh, Speak, I pray thee, unto thy servants in the Syrian language; for we understand <span class='add'>it:</span> and speak not to us in the Jews’ language, in the ears of the people that <span class='add'>are</span> on the wall. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>But Rabshakeh said, Hath my master sent me to thy master and to thee to speak these words? <span class='add'>hath he</span> not <span class='add'>sent me</span> to the men that sit upon the wall, that they may eat their own dung, and drink their own piss with you?  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>Then Rabshakeh stood, and cried with a loud voice in the Jews’ language, and said, Hear ye the words of the great king, the king of Assyria.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>Thus saith the king, Let not Hezekiah deceive you: for he shall not be able to deliver you.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>Neither let Hezekiah make you trust in the LORD, saying, The LORD will surely deliver us: this city shall not be delivered into the hand of the king of Assyria.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>Hearken not to Hezekiah: for thus saith the king of Assyria, Make <span class='add'>an agreement</span> with me <span class='add'>by</span> a present, and come out to me: and eat ye every one of his vine, and every one of his fig tree, and drink ye every one the waters of his own cistern;  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>Until I come and take you away to a land like your own land, a land of corn and wine, a land of bread and vineyards.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span> <span class='add'>Beware</span> lest Hezekiah persuade you, saying, The LORD will deliver us. Hath any of the gods of the nations delivered his land out of the hand of the king of Assyria?  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>Where <span class='add'>are</span> the gods of Hamath and Arphad? where <span class='add'>are</span> the gods of Sepharvaim? and have they delivered Samaria out of my hand?  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>Who <span class='add'>are they</span> among all the gods of these lands, that have delivered their land out of my hand, that the LORD should deliver Jerusalem out of my hand?  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>But they held their peace, and answered him not a word: for the king’s commandment was, saying, Answer him not. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>Then came Eliakim, the son of Hilkiah, that <span class='add'>was</span> over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah, the son of Asaph, the recorder, to Hezekiah with <span class='add'>their</span> clothes rent, and told him the words of Rabshakeh. </div><ul class='tnav'>
