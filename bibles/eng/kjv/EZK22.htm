I the LORD have spoken <span class='add'>it</span>, and will do <span class='add'>it</span>.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>And I will scatter thee among the heathen, and disperse thee in the countries, and will consume thy filthiness out of thee.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>And thou shalt take thine inheritance in thyself in the sight of the heathen, and thou shalt know that I <span class='add'>am</span> the LORD.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>Son of man, the house of Israel is to me become dross: all they <span class='add'>are</span> brass, and tin, and iron, and lead, in the midst of the furnace; they are <span class='add'>even</span> the dross of silver.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Because ye are all become dross, behold, therefore I will gather you into the midst of Jerusalem.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span> <span class='add'>As</span> they gather silver, and brass, and iron, and lead, and tin, into the midst of the furnace, to blow the fire upon it, to melt <span class='add'>it;</span> so will I gather <span class='add'>you</span> in mine anger and in my fury, and I will leave <span class='add'>you there</span>, and melt you.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>Yea, I will gather you, and blow upon you in the fire of my wrath, and ye shall be melted in the midst thereof.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>As silver is melted in the midst of the furnace, so shall ye be melted in the midst thereof; and ye shall know that I the LORD have poured out my fury upon you. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>Son of man, say unto her, Thou <span class='add'>art</span> the land that is not cleansed, nor rained upon in the day of indignation.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span> <span class='add'>There is</span> a conspiracy of her prophets in the midst thereof, like a roaring lion ravening the prey; they have devoured souls; they have taken the treasure and precious things; they have made her many widows in the midst thereof.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>Her priests have violated my law, and have profaned mine holy things: they have put no difference between the holy and profane, neither have they shewed <span class='add'>difference</span> between the unclean and the clean, and have hid their eyes from my sabbaths, and I am profaned among them.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>Her princes in the midst thereof <span class='add'>are</span> like wolves ravening the prey, to shed blood, <span class='add'>and</span> to destroy souls, to get dishonest gain.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&nbsp;</span>And her prophets have daubed them with untempered <span class='add'>morter</span>, seeing vanity, and divining lies unto them, saying, Thus saith the Lord GOD, when the LORD hath not spoken.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&nbsp;</span>The people of the land have used oppression, and exercised robbery, and have vexed the poor and needy: yea, they have oppressed the stranger wrongfully.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&nbsp;</span>And I sought for a man among them, that should make up the hedge, and stand in the gap before me for the land, that I should not destroy it: but I found none.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&nbsp;</span>Therefore have I poured out mine indignation upon them; I have consumed them with the fire of my wrath: their own way have I recompensed upon their heads, saith the Lord GOD. </div><ul class='tnav'>
