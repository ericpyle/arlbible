 <div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 18</div><div class='d'>To the chief Musician, A <span class='add'>Psalm</span> of David, the servant of the LORD, who spake unto the LORD the words of this song in the day <span class='add'>that</span> the LORD delivered him from the hand of all his enemies, and from the hand of Saul: And he said, </div><div class='p'>
 <span class="verse" id="V1">1&nbsp;</span>I will love thee, O LORD, my strength. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span>The LORD <span class='add'>is</span> my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer; my God, my strength, in whom I will trust; my buckler, and the horn of my salvation, <span class='add'>and</span> my high tower. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>I will call upon the LORD, <span class='add'>who is worthy</span> to be praised: so shall I be saved from mine enemies. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>The sorrows of death compassed me, and the floods of ungodly men made me afraid. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>The sorrows of hell compassed me about: the snares of death prevented me. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>In my distress I called upon the LORD, and cried unto my God: he heard my voice out of his temple, and my cry came before him, <span class='add'>even</span> into his ears. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>Then the earth shook and trembled; the foundations also of the hills moved and were shaken, because he was wroth. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>There went up a smoke out of his nostrils, and fire out of his mouth devoured: coals were kindled by it. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>He bowed the heavens also, and came down: and darkness <span class='add'>was</span> under his feet. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>And he rode upon a cherub, and did fly: yea, he did fly upon the wings of the wind. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>He made darkness his secret place; his pavilion round about him <span class='add'>were</span> dark waters <span class='add'>and</span> thick clouds of the skies. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>At the brightness <span class='add'>that was</span> before him his thick clouds passed, hail <span class='add'>stones</span> and coals of fire. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>The LORD also thundered in the heavens, and the Highest gave his voice; hail <span class='add'>stones</span> and coals of fire. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>Yea, he sent out his arrows, and scattered them; and he shot out lightnings, and discomfited them. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>Then the channels of waters were seen, and the foundations of the world were discovered at thy rebuke, O LORD, at the blast of the breath of thy nostrils. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>He sent from above, he took me, he drew me out of many waters. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>He delivered me from my strong enemy, and from them which hated me: for they were too strong for me. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>They prevented me in the day of my calamity: but the LORD was my stay. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>He brought me forth also into a large place; he delivered me, because he delighted in me. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>The LORD rewarded me according to my righteousness; according to the cleanness of my hands hath he recompensed me. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>For I have kept the ways of the LORD, and have not wickedly departed from my God. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>For all his judgments <span class='add'>were</span> before me, and I did not put away his statutes from me. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>I was also upright before him, and I kept myself from mine iniquity. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>Therefore hath the LORD recompensed me according to my righteousness, according to the cleanness of my hands in his eyesight. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>With the merciful thou wilt shew thyself merciful; with an upright man thou wilt shew thyself upright; </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>With the pure thou wilt shew thyself pure; and with the froward thou wilt shew thyself froward. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>For thou wilt save the afflicted people;
