 <span class="verse" id="V1">1&nbsp;</span>My soul is weary of my life; I will leave my complaint upon myself; I will speak in the bitterness of my soul.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span>I will say unto God, Do not condemn me; shew me wherefore thou contendest with me.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span> <span class='add'>Is it</span> good unto thee that thou shouldest oppress, that thou shouldest despise the work of thine hands, and shine upon the counsel of the wicked?  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>Hast thou eyes of flesh? or seest thou as man seeth?  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span> <span class='add'>Are</span> thy days as the days of man? <span class='add'>are</span> thy years as man’s days,  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>That thou enquirest after mine iniquity, and searchest after my sin?  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>Thou knowest that I am not wicked; and <span class='add'>there is</span> none that can deliver out of thine hand.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>Thine hands have made me and fashioned me together round about; yet thou dost destroy me.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>Remember, I beseech thee, that thou hast made me as the clay; and wilt thou bring me into dust again?  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>Hast thou not poured me out as milk, and curdled me like cheese?  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>Thou hast clothed me with skin and flesh, and hast fenced me with bones and sinews.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>Thou hast granted me life and favour, and thy visitation hath preserved my spirit.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>And these <span class='add'>things</span> hast thou hid in thine heart: I know that this <span class='add'>is</span> with thee.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>If I sin, then thou markest me, and thou wilt not acquit me from mine iniquity.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>If I be wicked, woe unto me; and <span class='add'>if</span> I be righteous, <span class='add'>yet</span> will I not lift up my head. <span class='add'>I am</span> full of confusion; therefore see thou mine affliction;  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>For it increaseth. Thou huntest me as a fierce lion: and again thou shewest thyself marvellous upon me.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>Thou renewest thy witnesses against me, and increasest thine indignation upon me; changes and war <span class='add'>are</span> against me.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>Wherefore then hast thou brought me forth out of the womb? Oh that I had given up the ghost, and no eye had seen me!  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>I should have been as though I had not been; I should have been carried from the womb to the grave.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span> <span class='add'>Are</span> not my days few? cease <span class='add'>then, and</span> let me alone, that I may take comfort a little,  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>Before I go <span class='add'>whence</span> I shall not return, <span class='add'>even</span> to the land of darkness and the shadow of death;  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>A land of darkness, as darkness <span class='add'>itself; and</span> of the shadow of death, without any order, and <span class='add'>where</span> the light <span class='add'>is</span> as darkness. </div><ul class='tnav'>
