 <span class="verse" id="V1">1&nbsp;</span>And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span>Son of man, set thy face toward Jerusalem, and drop <span class='add'>thy word</span> toward the holy places, and prophesy against the land of Israel,  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>And say to the land of Israel, Thus saith the LORD; Behold, I <span class='add'>am</span> against thee, and will draw forth my sword out of his sheath, and will cut off from thee the righteous and the wicked.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>Seeing then that I will cut off from thee the righteous and the wicked, therefore shall my sword go forth out of his sheath against all flesh from the south to the north:  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>That all flesh may know that I the LORD have drawn forth my sword out of his sheath: it shall not return any more.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>Sigh therefore, thou son of man, with the breaking of <span class='add'>thy</span> loins; and with bitterness sigh before their eyes.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>And it shall be, when they say unto thee, Wherefore sighest thou? that thou shalt answer, For the tidings; because it cometh: and every heart shall melt, and all hands shall be feeble, and every spirit shall faint, and all knees shall be weak <span class='add'>as</span> water: behold, it cometh, and shall be brought to pass, saith the Lord GOD. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>Again the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>Son of man, prophesy, and say, Thus saith the LORD; Say, A sword, a sword is sharpened, and also furbished:  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>It is sharpened to make a sore slaughter; it is furbished that it may glitter: should we then make mirth? it contemneth the rod of my son, <span class='add'>as</span> every tree.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>And he hath given it to be furbished, that it may be handled: this sword is sharpened, and it is furbished, to give it into the hand of the slayer.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>Cry and howl, son of man: for it shall be upon my people, it <span class='add'>shall be</span> upon all the princes of Israel: terrors by reason of the sword shall be upon my people: smite therefore upon <span class='add'>thy</span> thigh.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>Because <span class='add'>it is</span> a trial, and what if <span class='add'>the sword</span> contemn even the rod? it shall be no <span class='add'>more</span>, saith the Lord GOD.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>Thou therefore, son of man, prophesy, and smite <span class='add'>thine</span> hands together, and let the sword be doubled the third time, the sword of the slain: it <span class='add'>is</span> the sword of the great <span class='add'>men that are</span> slain, which entereth into their privy chambers.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>I have set the point of the sword against all their gates, that <span class='add'>their</span> heart may faint, and <span class='add'>their</span> ruins be multiplied: ah! <span class='add'>it is</span> made bright, <span class='add'>it is</span> wrapped up for the slaughter.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>Go thee one way or other, <span class='add'>either</span> on the right hand, <span class='add'>or</span> on the left, whithersoever thy face <span class='add'>is</span> set.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>I will also smite mine hands together, and I will cause my fury to rest: I the LORD have said <span class='add'>it</span>.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>The word of the LORD came unto me again, saying,  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>Also, thou son of man, appoint thee two ways, that the sword of the king of Babylon may come: both twain shall come forth out of one land: and choose thou a place, choose <span class='add'>it</span> at the head of the way to the city.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>Appoint a way, that the sword may come to Rabbath of the Ammonites, and to Judah in Jerusalem the defenced.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>For the king of Babylon stood at the parting of the way, at the head of the two ways, to use divination: he made <span class='add'>his</span> arrows bright, he consulted with images, he looked in the liver.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>At his right hand was the divination for Jerusalem, to appoint captains, to open the mouth in the slaughter, to lift up the voice with shouting, to appoint <span class='add'>battering</span> rams against the gates, to cast a mount, <span class='add'>and</span> to build a fort.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>And it shall be unto them as a false divination in their sight, to them that have sworn oaths: but he will call to remembrance the iniquity, that they may be taken.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Because ye have made your iniquity to be remembered, in that your transgressions are discovered, so that in all your doings your sins do appear; because, <span class='add'>I say</span>, that ye are come to remembrance, ye shall be taken with the hand. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>And thou, profane wicked prince of Israel, whose day is come, when iniquity <span class='add'>shall have</span> an end,  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>Thus saith the Lord GOD; Remove the diadem, and take off the crown: this <span class='add'>shall</span> not <span class='add'>be</span> the same: exalt <span class='add'>him that is</span> low, and abase <span class='add'>him that is</span> high.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>I will overturn, overturn, overturn, it: and it shall be no <span class='add'>more</span>, until he come whose right it is; and I will give it <span class='add'>him</span>. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V28">28&nbsp;</span>And thou, son of man, prophesy and say, Thus saith the Lord GOD concerning the Ammonites, and concerning their reproach; even say thou, The sword, the sword <span class='add'>is</span> drawn: for the slaughter <span class='add'>it is</span> furbished, to consume because of the glittering:  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&nbsp;</span>Whiles they see vanity unto thee, whiles they divine a lie unto thee, to bring thee upon the necks of <span class='add'>them that are</span> slain, of the wicked, whose day is come, when their iniquity <span class='add'>shall have</span> an end.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&nbsp;</span>Shall I cause <span class='add'>it</span> to return into his sheath? I will judge thee in the place where thou wast created, in the land of thy nativity.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&nbsp;</span>And I will pour out mine indignation upon thee, I will blow against thee in the fire of my wrath, and deliver thee into the hand of brutish men, <span class='add'>and</span> skilful to destroy.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&nbsp;</span>Thou shalt be for fuel to the fire; thy blood shall be in the midst of the land; thou shalt be no <span class='add'>more</span> remembered: for I the LORD have spoken <span class='add'>it</span>. </div><ul class='tnav'>
