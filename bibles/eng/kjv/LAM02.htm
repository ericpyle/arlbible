 <span class="verse" id="V1">1&nbsp;</span>How hath the Lord covered the daughter of Zion with a cloud in his anger, <span class='add'>and</span> cast down from heaven unto the earth the beauty of Israel, and remembered not his footstool in the day of his anger!  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span>The Lord hath swallowed up all the habitations of Jacob, and hath not pitied: he hath thrown down in his wrath the strong holds of the daughter of Judah; he hath brought <span class='add'>them</span> down to the ground: he hath polluted the kingdom and the princes thereof.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>He hath cut off in <span class='add'>his</span> fierce anger all the horn of Israel: he hath drawn back his right hand from before the enemy, and he burned against Jacob like a flaming fire, <span class='add'>which</span> devoureth round about.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>He hath bent his bow like an enemy: he stood with his right hand as an adversary, and slew all <span class='add'>that were</span> pleasant to the eye in the tabernacle of the daughter of Zion: he poured out his fury like fire.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>The Lord was as an enemy: he hath swallowed up Israel, he hath swallowed up all her palaces: he hath destroyed his strong holds, and hath increased in the daughter of Judah mourning and lamentation.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>And he hath violently taken away his tabernacle, as <span class='add'>if it were of</span> a garden: he hath destroyed his places of the assembly: the LORD hath caused the solemn feasts and sabbaths to be forgotten in Zion, and hath despised in the indignation of his anger the king and the priest.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>The Lord hath cast off his altar, he hath abhorred his sanctuary, he hath given up into the hand of the enemy the walls of her palaces; they have made a noise in the house of the LORD, as in the day of a solemn feast.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>The LORD hath purposed to destroy the wall of the daughter of Zion: he hath stretched out a line, he hath not withdrawn his hand from destroying: therefore he made the rampart and the wall to lament; they languished together.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>Her gates are sunk into the ground; he hath destroyed and broken her bars: her king and her princes <span class='add'>are</span> among the Gentiles: the law <span class='add'>is</span> no <span class='add'>more;</span> her prophets also find no vision from the LORD.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>The elders of the daughter of Zion sit upon the ground, <span class='add'>and</span> keep silence: they have cast up dust upon their heads; they have girded themselves with sackcloth: the virgins of Jerusalem hang down their heads to the ground.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>Mine eyes do fail with tears, my bowels are troubled, my liver is poured upon the earth, for the destruction of the daughter of my people; because the children and the sucklings swoon in the streets of the city.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>They say to their mothers, Where <span class='add'>is</span> corn and wine? when they swooned as the wounded in the streets of the city, when their soul was poured out into their mothers’ bosom.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>What thing shall I take to witness for thee? what thing shall I liken to thee, O daughter of Jerusalem? what shall I equal to thee, that I may comfort thee, O virgin daughter of Zion? for thy breach is great like the sea: who can heal thee?  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>Thy prophets have seen vain and foolish things for thee: and they have not discovered thine iniquity, to turn away thy captivity; but have seen for thee false burdens and causes of banishment.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>All that pass by clap <span class='add'>their</span> hands at thee; they hiss and wag their head at the daughter of Jerusalem, <span class='add'>saying, Is</span> this the city that <span class='add'>men</span> call The perfection of beauty, The joy of the whole earth?  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>All thine enemies have opened their mouth against thee: they hiss and gnash the teeth: they say, We have swallowed <span class='add'>her</span> up: certainly this <span class='add'>is</span> the day that we looked for; we have found, we have seen <span class='add'>it</span>.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>The LORD hath done <span class='add'>that</span> which he had devised; he hath fulfilled his word that he had commanded in the days of old: he hath thrown down, and hath not pitied: and he hath caused <span class='add'>thine</span> enemy to rejoice over thee, he hath set up the horn of thine adversaries.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>Their heart cried unto the Lord, O wall of the daughter of Zion, let tears run down like a river day and night: give thyself no rest; let not the apple of thine eye cease.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>Arise, cry out in the night: in the beginning of the watches pour out thine heart like water before the face of the Lord: lift up thy hands toward him for the life of thy young children, that faint for hunger in the top of every street. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>Behold, O LORD, and consider to whom thou hast done this. Shall the women eat their fruit, <span class='add'>and</span> children of a span long? shall the priest and the prophet be slain in the sanctuary of the Lord?  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>The young and the old lie on the ground in the streets: my virgins and my young men are fallen by the sword; thou hast slain <span class='add'>them</span> in the day of thine anger; thou hast killed, <span class='add'>and</span> not pitied.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>Thou hast called as in a solemn day my terrors round about, so that in the day of the LORD’s anger none escaped nor remained: those that I have swaddled and brought up hath mine enemy consumed. </div><ul class='tnav'>
