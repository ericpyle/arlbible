 <span class="verse" id="V1">1&nbsp;</span>Concerning the Ammonites, thus saith the LORD; Hath Israel no sons? hath he no heir? why <span class='add'>then</span> doth their king inherit Gad, and his people dwell in his cities?  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span>Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will cause an alarm of war to be heard in Rabbah of the Ammonites; and it shall be a desolate heap, and her daughters shall be burned with fire: then shall Israel be heir unto them that were his heirs, saith the LORD.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>Howl, O Heshbon, for Ai is spoiled: cry, ye daughters of Rabbah, gird you with sackcloth; lament, and run to and fro by the hedges; for their king shall go into captivity, <span class='add'>and</span> his priests and his princes together.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>Wherefore gloriest thou in the valleys, thy flowing valley, O backsliding daughter? that trusted in her treasures, <span class='add'>saying</span>, Who shall come unto me?  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>Behold, I will bring a fear upon thee, saith the Lord GOD of hosts, from all those that be about thee; and ye shall be driven out every man right forth; and none shall gather up him that wandereth.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>And afterward I will bring again the captivity of the children of Ammon, saith the LORD. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>Concerning Edom, thus saith the LORD of hosts; <span class='add'>Is</span> wisdom no more in Teman? is counsel perished from the prudent? is their wisdom vanished?  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>Flee ye, turn back, dwell deep, O inhabitants of Dedan; for I will bring the calamity of Esau upon him, the time <span class='add'>that</span> I will visit him.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>If grapegatherers come to thee, would they not leave <span class='add'>some</span> gleaning grapes? if thieves by night, they will destroy till they have enough.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>But I have made Esau bare, I have uncovered his secret places, and he shall not be able to hide himself: his seed is spoiled, and his brethren, and his neighbours, and he is not.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>Leave thy fatherless children, I will preserve <span class='add'>them</span> alive; and let thy widows trust in me.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>For thus saith the LORD; Behold, they whose judgment <span class='add'>was</span> not to drink of the cup have assuredly drunken; and <span class='add'>art</span> thou he <span class='add'>that</span> shall altogether go unpunished? thou shalt not go unpunished, but thou shalt surely drink <span class='add'>of it</span>.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>For I have sworn by myself, saith the LORD, that Bozrah shall become a desolation, a reproach, a waste, and a curse; and all the cities thereof shall be perpetual wastes.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>I have heard a rumour from the LORD, and an ambassador is sent unto the heathen, <span class='add'>saying</span>, Gather ye together, and come against her, and rise up to the battle.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>For, lo, I will make thee small among the heathen, <span class='add'>and</span> despised among men.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>Thy terribleness hath deceived thee, <span class='add'>and</span> the pride of thine heart, O thou that dwellest in the clefts of the rock, that holdest the height of the hill: though thou shouldest make thy nest as high as the eagle, I will bring thee down from thence, saith the LORD.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>Also Edom shall be a desolation: every one that goeth by it shall be astonished, and shall hiss at all the plagues thereof.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>As in the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah and the neighbour <span class='add'>cities</span> thereof, saith the LORD, no man shall abide there, neither shall a son of man dwell in it.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>Behold, he shall come up like a lion from the swelling of Jordan against the habitation of the strong: but I will suddenly make him run away from her: and who <span class='add'>is</span> a chosen <span class='add'>man, that</span> I may appoint over her? for who <span class='add'>is</span> like me? and who will appoint me the time? and who <span class='add'>is</span> that shepherd that will stand before me?  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>Therefore hear the counsel of the LORD, that he hath taken against Edom; and his purposes, that he hath purposed against the inhabitants of Teman: Surely the least of the flock shall draw them out: surely he shall make their habitations desolate with them.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>The earth is moved at the noise of their fall, at the cry the noise thereof was heard in the Red sea.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>Behold, he shall come up and fly as the eagle, and spread his wings over Bozrah: and at that day shall the heart of the mighty men of Edom be as the heart of a woman in her pangs. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>Concerning Damascus. Hamath is confounded, and Arpad: for they have heard evil tidings: they are fainthearted; <span class='add'>there is</span> sorrow on the sea; it cannot be quiet.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>Damascus is waxed feeble, <span class='add'>and</span> turneth herself to flee, and fear hath seized on <span class='add'>her:</span> anguish and sorrows have taken her, as a woman in travail.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>How is the city of praise not left, the city of my joy!  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>Therefore her young men shall fall in her streets, and all the men of war shall be cut off in that day, saith the LORD of hosts.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>And I will kindle a fire in the wall of Damascus, and it shall consume the palaces of Ben-hadad. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V28">28&nbsp;</span>Concerning Kedar, and concerning the kingdoms of Hazor, which Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon shall smite, thus saith the LORD; Arise ye, go up to Kedar, and spoil the men of the east.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&nbsp;</span>Their tents and their flocks shall they take away: they shall take to themselves their curtains, and all their vessels, and their camels; and they shall cry unto them, Fear <span class='add'>is</span> on every side. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V30">30&nbsp;</span>Flee, get you far off, dwell deep, O ye inhabitants of Hazor, saith the LORD; for Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon hath taken counsel against you, and hath conceived a purpose against you.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&nbsp;</span>Arise, get you up unto the wealthy nation, that dwelleth without care, saith the LORD, which have neither gates nor bars, <span class='add'>which</span> dwell alone.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&nbsp;</span>And their camels shall be a booty, and the multitude of their cattle a spoil: and I will scatter into all winds them <span class='add'>that are</span> in the utmost corners; and I will bring their calamity from all sides thereof, saith the LORD.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&nbsp;</span>And Hazor shall be a dwelling for dragons, <span class='add'>and</span> a desolation for ever: there shall no man abide there, nor <span class='add'>any</span> son of man dwell in it. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V34">34&nbsp;</span>The word of the LORD that came to Jeremiah the prophet against Elam in the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah, saying,  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&nbsp;</span>Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Behold, I will break the bow of Elam, the chief of their might.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&nbsp;</span>And upon Elam will I bring the four winds from the four quarters of heaven, and will scatter them toward all those winds; and there shall be no nation whither the outcasts of Elam shall not come.  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&nbsp;</span>For I will cause Elam to be dismayed before their enemies, and before them that seek their life: and I will bring evil upon them <span class='add'>even</span> my fierce anger, saith the LORD; and I will send the sword after them, till I have consumed them:  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&nbsp;</span>And I will set my throne in Elam, and will destroy from thence the king and the princes, saith the LORD. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V39">39&nbsp;</span>But it shall come to pass in the latter days, <span class='add'>that</span> I will bring again the captivity of Elam, saith the LORD. </div><ul class='tnav'>
