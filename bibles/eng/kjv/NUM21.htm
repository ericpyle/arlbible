 <span class="verse" id="V1">1&nbsp;</span>And <span class='add'>when</span> king Arad the Canaanite, which dwelt in the south, heard tell that Israel came by the way of the spies; then he fought against Israel, and took <span class='add'>some</span> of them prisoners.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span>And Israel vowed a vow unto the LORD, and said, If thou wilt indeed deliver this people into my hand, then I will utterly destroy their cities.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>And the LORD hearkened to the voice of Israel, and delivered up the Canaanites; and they utterly destroyed them and their cities: and he called the name of the place Hormah. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>And they journeyed from mount Hor by the way of the Red sea, to compass the land of Edom: and the soul of the people was much discouraged because of the way.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>And the people spake against God, and against Moses, Wherefore have ye brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness? for <span class='add'>there is</span> no bread, neither <span class='add'>is there any</span> water; and our soul loatheth this light bread.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>And the LORD sent fiery serpents among the people, and they bit the people; and much people of Israel died. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>Therefore the people came to Moses, and said, We have sinned, for we have spoken against the LORD, and against thee; pray unto the LORD, that he take away the serpents from us. And Moses prayed for the people.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>And the LORD said unto Moses, Make thee a fiery serpent, and set it upon a pole: and it shall come to pass, that every one that is bitten, when he looketh upon it, shall live.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>And Moses made a serpent of brass, and put it upon a pole, and it came to pass, that if a serpent had bitten any man, when he beheld the serpent of brass, he lived. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>And the children of Israel set forward, and pitched in Oboth.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>And they journeyed from Oboth, and pitched at Ije-abarim, in the wilderness which <span class='add'>is</span> before Moab, toward the sunrising. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>From thence they removed, and pitched in the valley of Zared.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>From thence they removed, and pitched on the other side of Arnon, which <span class='add'>is</span> in the wilderness that cometh out of the coasts of the Amorites: for Arnon <span class='add'>is</span> the border of Moab, between Moab and the Amorites.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>Wherefore it is said in the book of the wars of the LORD, What he did in the Red sea, and in the brooks of Arnon,  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>And at the stream of the brooks that goeth down to the dwelling of Ar, and lieth upon the border of Moab.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>And from thence <span class='add'>they went</span> to Beer: that <span class='add'>is</span> the well whereof the LORD spake unto Moses, Gather the people together, and I will give them water. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>Then Israel sang this song, Spring up, O well; sing ye unto it:  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>The princes digged the well, the nobles of the people digged it, by <span class='add'>the direction of</span> the lawgiver, with their staves. And from the wilderness <span class='add'>they went</span> to Mattanah:  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>And from Mattanah to Nahaliel: and from Nahaliel to Bamoth:  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>And from Bamoth <span class='add'>in</span> the valley, that <span class='add'>is</span> in the country of Moab, to the top of Pisgah, which looketh toward Jeshimon. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>And Israel sent messengers unto Sihon king of the Amorites, saying,  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>Let me pass through thy land: we will not turn into the fields, or into the vineyards; we will not drink <span class='add'>of</span> the waters of the well: <span class='add'>but</span> we will go along by the king’s <span class='add'>high</span> way, until we be past thy borders.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>And Sihon would not suffer Israel to pass through his border: but Sihon gathered all his people together, and went out against Israel into the wilderness: and he came to Jahaz, and fought against Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>And Israel smote him with the edge of the sword, and possessed his land from Arnon unto Jabbok, even unto the children of Ammon: for the border of the children of Ammon <span class='add'>was</span> strong.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>And Israel took all these cities: and Israel dwelt in all the cities of the Amorites, in Heshbon, and in all the villages thereof.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>For Heshbon <span class='add'>was</span> the city of Sihon the king of the Amorites, who had fought against the former king of Moab, and taken all his land out of his hand, even unto Arnon.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>Wherefore they that speak in proverbs say, Come into Heshbon, let the city of Sihon be built and prepared:  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&nbsp;</span>For there is a fire gone out of Heshbon, a flame from the city of Sihon: it hath consumed Ar of Moab, <span class='add'>and</span> the lords of the high places of Arnon.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&nbsp;</span>Woe to thee, Moab! thou art undone, O people of Chemosh: he hath given his sons that escaped, and his daughters, into captivity unto Sihon king of the Amorites.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&nbsp;</span>We have shot at them; Heshbon is perished even unto Dibon, and we have laid them waste even unto Nophah, which <span class='add'>reacheth</span> unto Medeba. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V31">31&nbsp;</span>Thus Israel dwelt in the land of the Amorites.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&nbsp;</span>And Moses sent to spy out Jaazer, and they took the villages thereof, and drove out the Amorites that <span class='add'>were</span> there. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V33">33&nbsp;</span>And they turned and went up by the way of Bashan: and Og the king of Bashan went out against them, he, and all his people, to the battle at Edrei.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&nbsp;</span>And the LORD said unto Moses, Fear him not: for I have delivered him into thy hand, and all his people, and his land; and thou shalt do to him as thou didst unto Sihon king of the Amorites, which dwelt at Heshbon.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&nbsp;</span>So they smote him, and his sons, and all his people, until there was none left him alive: and they possessed his land. </div><ul class='tnav'>
