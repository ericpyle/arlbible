<div class='mt'>THE WISDOM OF JESUS THE SON OF SIRACH, </div><div class='mt2'>OR </div><div class='mt'>ECCLESIASTICUS </div><div class='is'>The Prologue of the Wisdom of Jesus the Son of Sirach. </div><div class='ip'>WHEREAS many and great things have been delivered to us by the law and the prophets, and by the others that have followed in their steps, for the which things we must give Israel the praise of instruction and wisdom; and since not only the readers must needs become skillful themselves, but also those who love learning must be able to profit them which are without, both by speaking and writing; my grandfather Jesus, having much given himself to the reading of the law, and the prophets, and the other books of our fathers, and having gained great familiarity therein, was drawn on also himself to write somewhat pertaining to instruction and wisdom; in order that those who love learning, and are addicted to these things, might make progress much more by living according to the law. You⌃ are entreated therefore to read with favor and attention, and to pardon us, if in any parts of what we have laboured to interpret, we may seem to fail in some of the phrases. For things originally spoken in Hebrew have not the same force in them, when they are translated into another tongue: and not only these, but the law itself, and the prophecies, and the rest of the books, have no small difference, when they are spoken in their original language. For having come into Egypt in the eight and thirties year of Energetes the king, and having continued there some time, I found <a href="#FN21" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> Or, a like work The word is of very doubtful meaning. </span></a> a copy affording no small instruction. I thought it therefore most necessary for me to apply some diligence and travail to interpret this book; applying indeed much watchfulness and skill in that space of time to bring the book to an end, and set it forth for them also, who in the land of their sojourning are desirous to learn, fashioning their manners beforehand, so as to live according to the law. </div> <div class='b'></div><div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 1</div><div class='q'>
