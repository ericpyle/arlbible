 <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>and he enlarged the borders of his nation, and got possession of the country;  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>and he gathered together a great number of captives, and got the dominion of Gazara, and Bethsura, and the citadel, and he took away from it its uncleannesses;
