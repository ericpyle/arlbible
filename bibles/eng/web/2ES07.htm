Then he said to me, There is a sea set in a wide place, that it might be <a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> So the chief Oriental versions.

<span class="verse" id="V47">47&nbsp;</span>And now I see, that the world to come shall bring delight to few, but torments to many.  <span class="verse" id="V48">48&nbsp;</span>For an evil heart has

for us. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V70">70&nbsp;</span>And he answered me, and said, When the Most High made the world, and Adam and all them that came of him, he first prepared the

and before whom they shall be judged in the last times.  <span class="verse" id="V88">88&nbsp;</span>Now this is the order of those who have kept the ways of the Most High, when they shall be

is the teaching concerning them:  <span class="verse" id="V91">91&nbsp;</span>First of all they shall see with great joy the glory of him who takes them up, for they shall have rest in seven orders.  <span class="verse" id="V92">92&nbsp;</span>The first order, because they have striven with great labor to overcome the evil thought which was fashoned together with them, that it might not lead them astray from life into death.  <span class="verse" id="V93">93&nbsp;</span>The second order, because they see the perplexity in which the souls of the ungodly wander, and the punishment that awaits them.  <span class="verse" id="V94">94&nbsp;</span>The third order, they see the witness which he that fashioned them bears concerning them, that while they lived they kept the law which was given them in trust.  <span class="verse" id="V95">95&nbsp;</span>The fourth order, they understand the rest which, being gathered in their chambers, they now enjoy with great quietness, guarded by angels, and the glory that awaits them in the last days.  <span class="verse" id="V96">96&nbsp;</span>The fifth order, they rejoice, <span class='add'>seeing </span> how they have now escaped from that which is corruptible, and how they shall inherit that which is to come, while they see moreover the straitness and the <a href="#FN21" class="notemark">***<span class="popup"> The Latin is here corrupt. </span></a> painfulness from which they have been delivered, and the large room which they shall receive with joy and immortality.  <span class="verse" id="V97">97&nbsp;</span>The sixth order, when it is showed to them how their face shall shine as the sun, and how they shall be made like to the light of the stars, being henceforth incorruptible.  <span class="verse" id="V98">98&nbsp;</span>The seventh order, which is greater than all the aforesaid orders, because they shall rejoice with confidence, and because they shall be bold without confusion, and shall be glad without fear, for they hasten to behold the face of him whom in their lifetine they served, and from whom they shall receive <span class='add'>their </span> reward in glory.  <span class="verse" id="V99">99&nbsp;</span>This
