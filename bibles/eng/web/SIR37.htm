 <span class="verse" id="V1">1&nbsp;</span>Every friend will say, I also am his friend: </div><div class='q'>But there is a friend, which is only a friend in name. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span>Is there not a grief in it even to death, </div><div class='q'>When a companion and friend is turned to enmity? </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>O wicked imagination, whence came you rolling in </div><div class='q'>To cover the dry land with deceitfulness? </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>There is a companion, which rejoices in the gladness of a friend, </div><div class='q'>But in time of affliction will be against him. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>There is a companion, which for the belly’s sake labores with his friend, </div><div class='q'>In the face of battle will take up the buckler. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>Forget not a friend in your soul; </div><div class='q'>And be not unmindful of him in your riches. </div><div class='b'></div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>Every counsellor extols counsel; </div><div class='q'>But there is that counsels for himself. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>Let your soul beware of a counsellor, </div><div class='q'>And know you before what is his interest </div><div class='q'>(For he will take counsel for himself); </div><div class='q'>Lest he cast the lot upon you, </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>And say to you, Your way is good: </div><div class='q'>And he will stand near you, to see what will happen to you. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>Take not counsel with one that looks askance at you;
