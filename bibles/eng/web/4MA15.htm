 <span class="verse" id="V1">1&nbsp;</span>O reasoning of the sons, lord over the passions, and religion more desirable to a mother than progeny!  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span>The mother, when two things were set before here, religion and the safety of her seven sons for a time, on the conditional promise of a tyrant,  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>rather elected the religion which according to God preserves to eternal life.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>O in what way can I describe ethically the affections of parents toward their children, the resemblance of soul and of form engrafted into the small type of a child in a wonderful manner, especially through the greater sympathy of mothers with the feelings of those born of them!  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>for by how much mothers are by nature weak in disposition and prolific in offspring, by so much the fonder they are of children.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>And of all mothers the mother of the seven was the fondest of children, who in seven childbirths had deeply engendered love toward them;  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>and through her many pains undergone in connection with each one, was compelled to feel sympathy with them;  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>yet, through fear of God, she neglected the temporary salvation of her children.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>Not but that, on account of the excellent disposition to the law, her maternal affection toward them was increased.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>For they were both just and temperate, and manly, and high-minded, and fond of their kindred, and so fond of their mother that even to death they obeyed her by observing the law.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>And yet, though there were so many circumstances connected with love of children to draw on a mother to sympathy, in the case of none of them were the various tortures able to pervert her principle.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>But she inclined each one separately and all together to death for religion.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>O holy nature and parental feeling, and reward of bringing up children, and unconquerable maternal affection!  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>At the racking and roasting of each one of them, the observant mother was prevented by religion from changing.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>She saw her children’s flesh dissolving around the fire; and their extremities quivering on the ground, and the flesh of their heads dropped forwards down to their beards, like masks.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>O you mother, who was tried at this time with bitterer pangs than those of parturition!  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>O you only woman who have brought forth perfect holiness!  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>Your firstborn, expiring, turned you not; nor the second, looking miserable in his torments; nor the third, breathing out his soul.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>Nor when you did behold the eyes of each of them looking sternly upon their tortures, and their nostrils foreboding death, did you weep!  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>When you did see children’s flesh heaped upon children’s flesh that had been torn off, heads decapitated upon heads, dead falling upon the dead, and a choir of children turned through torture into a burying ground, you lamented not.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>Not so do siren melodies, or songs of swans, attract the hearers to listening, O voices of children calling upon your mother in the midst of torments!  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>With what and what manner of torments was the mother herself tortured, as her sons were undergoing the wheel and the fires!  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>But religious reasoning, having strengthened her courage in the midst of sufferings, enabled her to forego, for the time, parental love.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>Although beholding the destruction of seven children, the noble mother, after one embrace, stripped off <span class='add'>her feelings</span> through faith in God.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>For just as in a council-room, beholding in her own soul vehement counselors, nature and parentage and love of her children, and the racking of her children,  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>she holding two votes, one for the death, the other for the preservation of her children,  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>did not lean to that which would have saved her children for the safety of a brief space.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&nbsp;</span>But this daughter of Abraham remembered his holy fortitude.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&nbsp;</span>O holy mother of a nation avenger of the law, and defender of religion, and prime bearer in the battle of the affections!  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&nbsp;</span>O you nobler in endurance than males, and more manly than men in perseverance!  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&nbsp;</span>For as the ark of Noah, bearing the world in the world-filling flood, bore up against the waves,  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&nbsp;</span>so you, the guardian of the law, when surrounded on every side by the flood of passions, and straitened by violent storms which were the torments of they children, did bear up nobly against the storms against religion. </div><ul class='tnav'>
