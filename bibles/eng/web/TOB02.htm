 <span class="verse" id="V1">1&nbsp;</span>Now when I had come home again, and my wife Anna was restored to me, and my son Tobias, in the feast of Pentecost, which is the holy feast of the seven weeks, there was a good dinner prepared me, and I sat down to eat.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span>I saw abundance of meat, and I said to my son, “Go and bring whatever poor man you find of our kindred, who is mindful of the Lord. Behold, I wait for you.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>Then he came, and said, “Father, one of our race is strangled, and has been cast out in the marketplace.”  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>Before I had tasted anything, I sprang up, and took him up into a chamber until the sun had set.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>Then I returned, washed myself, ate my bread in heaviness,  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>and remembered the prophecy of Amos, as he said, </div><div class='q'><a href="#FN1" class="notemark">✡<span class="popup">Amos 8:10</span></a>“Your feasts will be turned into mourning, </div><div class='q2'>and all your mirth into lamentation. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>So I wept: and when the sun had set, I went and dug a grave, and buried him.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>My neighbors mocked me, and said, “He is no longer afraid to be put to death for this matter; and yet he fled away. Behold, he buries the dead again.”  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>The same night I returned from burying him, and slept by the wall of my courtyard, being polluted; and my face was uncovered.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>I didn’t know that there were sparrows in the wall. My eyes were open and the sparrows dropped warm dung into my eyes, and white films came over my eyes. I went to the physicians, and they didn’t help me; but Achiacharus nourished me, <a href="#FN2" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> Some authorities read until he went. </span></a> until I went into Elymais. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>My wife Anna wove cloth in the women’s chambers,  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>and sent the work back to the owners.

Is it stolen? Give it back to the owners; for it is not lawful to eat anything that is stolen.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>But she said, “It has been given to me for a gift more than the wages.” </div><div class='p'>I didn’t believe her, and I asked her to return it to the owners; and I was ashamed of her. </div><div class='p'>But she answered and said to me, “Where are your alms and your righteous deeds?
