 <span class="verse" id="V1">1&nbsp;</span>When he, too, had undergone blessed martyrdom, and died in the caldron into which he had been thrown, the seventh, the youngest of all, came forward:  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span>whom the tyrant pitying, though he had been dreadfully reproached by his kindred,  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>seeing him already encompassed with chains, had him brought nearer, and endeavoured to counsel him, saying,  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>You see the end of the madness of your kindred: for they have died in torture through disobedience; and you, if disobedient, having been miserably tormented, will yourself perish prematurely.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>But if you obey, you shall be my friend, and have a charge over the affairs of the kingdom.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>And having thus exhorted him, he sent for the mother of the boy; that, by condoling with her for the loss of so many sons, he might incline her, through the hope of safety, to render the survivor obedient.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>And he, after his mother had urged him on in the Hebrew tongue, (as we shall soon relate) says,  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>Release me that I may speak to the king and all his friends.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>And they, rejoicing exceedingly at the promise of the youth, quickly let him go.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>And he, running up to the pans, said,  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>Impious tyrant, and most blasphemous man, were you not ashamed, having received prosperity and a kingdom from God, to kill His servants, and to rack the doers of godliness?  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>Wherefore the divine vengeance is reserving you for eternal fire and torments, which shall cling to you for all time.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>Were you not ashamed, man as you are, yet most savage, to cut out the tongues of men of like feeling and origin, and having thus abused to torture them?  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>But they, bravely dying, fulfilled their religion towards God.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>But you shall groan according to your deserts for having slain without cause the champions of virtue.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>Wherefore, he continued, I myself, being about to die,  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>will not forsake my kindred.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>And I call upon the God of my fathers to be merciful to my race.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>But you, both living and dead, he will punish.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>Thus having prayed, he hurled himself into the pans; and so expired. </div><ul class='tnav'>
