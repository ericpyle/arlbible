 <span class="verse" id="V1">1&nbsp;</span>And upon the third day, when she had ended her prayer, she laid away her garments of service, and put on her glorious apparel.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span>And being majestically adorned, after she had called upon the all-seeing God and savior, she took her two maids with her:  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>and upon the one she leaned, as carrying herself delicately;  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>and the other followed, bearing up her train.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>And she was ruddy through the perfection of her beauty, and her countenance was cheerful <span class='add'>and </span> right amiable: but her heart was in anguish for fear.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>Then having passed through all the doors, she stood before the king, who sat upon his royal throne, and was clothed with all his robes of majesty, all <span class='add'>glittering </span> with gold and precious stones; and he was very dreadful.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>Then lifting up his countenance that was flushed with glory, he looked <span class='add'>upon her </span> in fierce anger: and the queen fell down, and turned pale, and fainted, and she bowed herself upon the head of the maid that went before.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>Then God changed the spirit of the king into mildness, who in an agony leaped from his throne, and took her in his arms, till she came to herself again, and comforted her with soothing words, and said to her,  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>Esther, what is the matter? I am your brother, be of good cheer:  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>you will not die, for <a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> Or, the commandment is both yours and mine Gr. our commandment is common. </span></a> our commandment is for our subjects: come near.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>So he held up his golden sceptre, and laid it upon her neck,  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>and embraced her, and said, Speak to me.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>Then said she to him, I saw you, my lord, as an angel of God, and my heart was troubled for fear of your glory.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>For wonderful are you, my lord, and your countenance is full of grace.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>And as she was speaking, she fell down for faintness.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>Then the king was troubled, and all his servants comforted her. <a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> Here follows Esther 5:3. </span></a> </div><ul class='tnav'>
