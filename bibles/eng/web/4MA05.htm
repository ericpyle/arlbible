 <span class="verse" id="V1">1&nbsp;</span>The tyrant Antiochus, therefore, sitting in public state with his assessors upon a certain lofty place, with his armed troops standing in a circle around him,  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span>commanded his spearbearers to seize every one of the Hebrews, and to compel them to taste swine’s flesh, and things offered to idols.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>And should any of them be unwilling to eat the accursed food, they were to be tortured on the wheel, and so killed.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>And when many had been seized, a foremost man of the assembly, a Hebrew, by name Eleazar, a priest by family, by profession a lawyer, and advanced in years, and for this reason known to many of the king’s followers, was brought near to him.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>And Antiochus seeing him, said,  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>I would counsel you, old man, before your tortures begin, to taste the swine’s flesh, and save your life; for I feel respect for your age and hoary head, which since you have had so long, you appear to me to be no philosopher in retaining the superstition of the Jews.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>For wherefore, since nature has conferred upon you the most excellent flesh of this animal, do you loathe it?  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>It seems senseless not to enjoy what is pleasant, yet not disgraceful; and from notions of sinfulness, to reject the boons of nature.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>And you will be acting, I think, still more senselessly, if you follow vain conceits about the truth.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>And you will, moreover, be despising me to your own punishment.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>Will you not awake from your trifling philosophy? and give up the folly of your notions; and, regaining understanding worthy of your age, search into the truth of an expedient course?  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>and, reverencing my kindly admonition, have pity upon your own years?  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>For, bear in mind, that if there be any power which watches over this religion of yours, it will pardon you for all transgressions of the law which you commit through compulsion.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>While the tyrant incited him in this manner to the unlawful eating of flesh, Eleazar begged permission to speak.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>And having received power to speak, he began thus to deliver himself:  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>We, O Antiochus, who are persuaded that we live under a divine law, consider no compulsion to be so forcible as obedience to that law;  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>wherefore we consider that we ought not in any point to transgress the law.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>And indeed, were our law (as you suppose) not truly divine, and if we wrongly think it divine, we should have no right even in that case to destroy our sense of religion.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>think not eating the unclean, then, a trifling offense.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>For transgression of the law, whether in small or great matters, is of equal moment;  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>for in either case the law is equally slighted.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>But you deride our philosophy, as though we lived irrationally in it.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>Yet it instructs us in temperance, so that we are superior to all pleasures and lusts; and it exercises us in manliness, so that we cheerfully undergo every grievance.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>And it instructs us in justice, so that in all our dealings we render what is due; and it teaches us piety, so that we worship the one only God becomingly.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>Wherefore it is that we eat not the unclean; for believing that the law was established by God, we are convinced that the Creator of the world, in giving his laws, sympathizes with our nature.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>Those things which are convenient to our souls, he has directed us to eat; but those which are repugnant to them, he has interdicted.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>But, tyrant-like, you not only force us to break the law, but also to eat, that you may ridicule us as we thus profanely eat:  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&nbsp;</span>but you shall not have this cause of laughter against me;  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&nbsp;</span>nor will I transgress the sacred oaths of my forefathers to keep the law.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&nbsp;</span>No, not if you pluck out my eyes, and consume my entrails.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&nbsp;</span>I am not so old, and void of manliness, but that my rational powers are youthful in defence of my religion.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&nbsp;</span>Now then; prepare your wheels, and kindle a fiercer flame.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&nbsp;</span>I will not so compassionate my old age, as on my account to break the law of my country.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&nbsp;</span>I will not belie you, O law, my instructor! or forsake you, O beloved self-control!  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&nbsp;</span>I will not put you to shame, O philosopher Reason; or deny you, O honored priesthood, and science of the law.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&nbsp;</span>Mouth! you shall not pollute my old age, nor the full stature of a perfect life.  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&nbsp;</span>My fathers shall receive me pure, not having quailed before your compulsion, though to death.  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&nbsp;</span>For over the ungodly you shall tyrannize; but you shall not lord it over my thoughts about religion, either by your arguments, or through deeds. </div><ul class='tnav'>
